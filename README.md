## üåê Background

In the age of the Internet, the e-commerce market has seen exponential growth. A pivotal part of online shopping is the reviews that users drop on products they've purchased. These reviews, a treasure trove of data, when analyzed right, can deliver deep insights into customer satisfaction and market preferences.

A leading e-commerce company wishes to harness this data goldmine. They've amassed a plethora of product reviews and are gearing up to analyze them to enhance the service quality they deliver. This is where YOUR challenge begins.

### üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset you'll be harnessing is a modified version of an Amazon product reviews set, consisting of:

- `Summary`: A succinct review summary penned by the user.
- `Text`: The full-blown review content.

The `Score` column, representing the product rating given by the user (on a 1 to 5 scale), has been axed for this challenge. This will be the target variable your model must predict.

## üéØ Tasks

- Task 1: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to craft a classification model that can predict the "rating" of a review, relying solely on its textual content. The company has made some tweaks and omissions to safeguard user privacy. Thus, they'll supply you with just two features to work on: 'Summary' and 'Text'.

## üìä Evaluation

As part of our commitment to providing a clear and consistent assessment of performance, this practice will be evaluated automatically using the **F1 Micro Score** metric.
