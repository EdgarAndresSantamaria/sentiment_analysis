4;Not as sweet as I expected, but still really good!;The good thing about Krave cereal is that it does taste like chocolate. The chocolate doesn't taste forced or artificial.
1;Bonsai Bare Branches;I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown.
3;Thick soup, a bit too thick;We enjoy thick soups. The Bob's Red Mill Whole Grains and Beans Soup Mix takes thick a bit too far.
5;My Mom was thrilled;I was a bit hesitant about ordering this because of the mixed reviews.  However, the good seemed to outweigh the bad and this just looked like something my mother would like so I ordered it.
4;Don't eat a whole one;One of the only things my mini poodle gets to eat. They don't bother him has long it is in moderation, if he is allowed a whole one it will give him the runs.
5;good deal;Same stable and good quality of Meiji Yan Yan. When I got the good deal from Amazon.
1;ROTTEN SERVICE...... ISH!;Well, just be sure that you dont mind ordering bulk and getting an entirely different product than you ordered!!! ~Amazon.com sellers' return policy doesn't allow returns.
5;She loves it;I can understand this might not be for every dog
5;Authentic Swedish pepparkakor;Just like my grandmother used to bake.  Because they're so thin, I've never eaten another cookie just like them.
5;Great treats;Any edible bone can cause a dog to choke, but Greenies changed their formula about a year ago to make it more digestible.  I love the product.
5;Not a fan of tea but I love this!;Not only am I not a fan of tea, I'm not a fan of licorice but I was open to trying this as a means to help me manage my IBS (I also use fennel and peppermint tea). This tastes so delicious, I want to drink it whether my stomach feels good or not! Yummy! And a cup does sooth my savage stomach.
5;Great Alternative to Potato Chips;Simply put this is a great alternative to regular potato chips.  These chips are all natural
5;Great Birthday Present;I bought this Gift Basket for my Mother's 92nd Birthday.  She loved the contents but she especially love the wooden box that came with the gift.
5;Great Flavor, Prompt Shipment!;After reading some earlier reviews I was very pleased when I recieved my order so promptly and in perfect condition.  I guess the cold weather may have also helped my chocolates not to melt, considering the packaging isn't the greatest (they are not individually wrapped).
3;Dad's favorite;The Emeril's decaf is my husbands favorite of all the decaf's we have tried so far. For me, it tastes a little burned and reminds me of Starbucks.
2;Check your boxes;I have been purchasing there products for 2-3 years now. Not always, but sometimes the box contains bugs inside the bones, that make my dog sick.
5;No hulls;I think the popcorn tastes great.  I reminds me when we didn't have microwaves and had to pop it on the stove.
5;Good flavor enhancer;I actually purchased these boxes of soup for the little packet of dry broth to use to make gravies and other dishes with chicken flavor. I think it is perfect.
4;Finally!;I've asked for this flavor in three local groceries..
5;Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups;Lot's of flavor, is a favorite! Will always buy. Amazon is the best to purchace from.
4;Nice and spicy pizza oil;We fell in love with the spicy pizza oil they used to serve at Buca de Beppo's but it was eventually pulled when the bean counters took over (and they removed the spicy pizza itself). This oil is very similar.
5;Ostrim Products;The best healthy snack there is. When you crave that late night meat without the guilt this is the product for you.
5;Delicious!;These are wonderful. First tried them while sampling the goods at [.
5;Chicken Jalfrezi Curry tastes amazing with this sauce!;I cooked a pound of chicken plus a half a pound of peas. That plus rice made for a delicious dinner! I paid $3.
1;OLD, NASTY....YUK!;Ordered two cases because of good reviews.  Both cases due to expire in several months.
1;Seems to have changed for the worse;I have been ordering this product for a year and for the last few months it seems quite different.  It no longer clumps well and certainly doesn't block much in terms of odor.
5;Great product;The Clear Jel arrived quickly with the packages intact. I appreciate that the product comes in one pound packages.
1;The worst tasting thing out of my Keurig;I really had high expectations of this product but the artificial flavoring just kills it.<br />My wife gets migraines and the artificial flavoring in this product has been reported to make these worse.
4;good stuff;I like Annie's products..
5;Wellness;After their first month on Wellness food, the kitties have stopped making wretching noises and vomiting completely.  And they show a strong preference for this food.
4;Organic Coffee Co. coffee review;I really enjoyed this coffee. I like the whole bean coffees best, because it tastes fresher and smoother when I grind it myself.
5;Incredible coffee;Best blend and senseo pod yet!<br /><br />Very rich and strong.  Tastes incredible.
4;Yummy in Baby's Tummy!;Our almost 7 month old is in his 4th week of eating solids and he loves Plum Organics food! So far the Pear and Mango is his favorite flavor. We have also tried other flavors and he loves them all.
4;T A S T Y......L O W....C A L O R I C .....L E S S....S A L T..........B U T....S T I L L;CAMPBELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAME OF MUSHROOM (Soup) 10.75-OUNCE CANS, (PACK OF 24), contains a tasty blend of mostly-natural ingredients.
4;Delicious, although Yorkshire Gold is even better;This tea is delicious. Although not quite as good as Yorkshire Gold, it is still a very pleasant, well balanced, and flavorful tea.
5;yummy for your tummy;The New York Cheddar flavor is my favorite of all the Kettle Brand potato chips. These are flavorful and crunchy and will make your mouth happy.
5;Best chamomile we've tried;This is the chamomile tea my husband drinks every night. It has the best flavor of any of the chamomiles we've tried.
5;Awesome!;I purchased this to give my dog something to do while he is in his crate while we are away at work. Just to see if he liked it I gave it to him earlier today, he's chewed on it nonstop for hours.
1;Please research this formula carefully before using!;I used this formula for my baby from 6 weeks old to 1 year after trying to nurse unsuccessfully.  He tolerated it well and I thought this was a terrific product while using it.
5;Clear Tones!;"I have been singing ""lead"" in barbershop quartets for more than 40 years.  Phlegm is a constant problem for singers, especially the lead, who must sing with clear, strong tones for the other three to match."
1;Terrible smell, starving cat wouldn't eat it;This stuff smells bad,and looks worse. My cat will eat anything and is not finicky.
5;Mesquite BBQ;These chips are the best!! I've tried some of the other flavors and they are ok, nothing special..
5;Love these chips!;These chips are great. I love the hot and spicy seasoning.
2;cost-cutting?;I have been wanting to do a review for this chocolate for months now and finally got to it. I have always loved this chocolate to the extent my husband buys it for me whenever he sees it and I also buy my own.
5;great tea;Wonderful tea that is consistent in its great taste. Nice flavor, easy to work with the Keurig brewer.
5;Great for training;Reasonably priced, healthy & all natural, low-calorie. They're small and easy to chew, so they are great for training sessions.
5;good deal;I like the good price and taste and just the fact it is organic so when my picky child eats badly at least I know it is not all that bad ..
5;oil;This seems like a good product. We buy a lot of organic food and the price was reasonable for the olive oil.
4;Cats seem to like it;We have two cats, and they both seem to like this food. One of our cats is generally picky about her dry food, but even she'll eat this.
5;Loved these;A friend of mine brought me some of these candy bars from Austrailia..
4;Tasty, Sweet and Natural Treat.;Unlike what another reviewer said, brown rice syrup IS sugar, just an alternative to other types of sweeteners typically used in other products. Hey, I'm all on board for a natural sweetener versus the crap they put in most bars, but this isn't health food.
5;WORTH THE PRICE!!!;"Just thought I should let everyone know, these are THE BEST fish flakes on the market. My cats go bonkers when I even mention ""fish flakes"" around the house (or anything that remotely sounds like ""fish flakes""."
5;one of a KIND, delicious gluten free bar;I have never been one to rely on nor crave a bar. Following a gluten-free and low- allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them.
4;Always Faithful;I would have given this product a 5 star, but tge price is a bit steep. The cookies were fresh and tasted as shortbread tastes.
5;"REEEEEEEEESEEEEEE! ""Liquid Crack""";This product is LEGENDARY!  One of the best tasting peanut butter out there. If you like Reese's peanut butter cup this is the main ingredient in them.
5;Healthy Snack for dogs;great healthy option for your dog. ONe of the few snacks without artificial fillers.
5;Refreshing;I've tried several varieties and I find the orange the best.<br />The drink is not sweet, but when served very cold, it's refreshing.
5;My favorite;these are easily my favorite seeds. Easily the best.
1;Contains SPLENDA - yuck;"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this."
2;Not enjoyable;I have used sugar-free Da Vinci syrups in coffee, protein shakes, and cheesecakes without much of a problem, but for some reason the Sugar-Free Pumpkin Pie Syrup had a horrible aftertaste. Very Splenda-y.
5;love them!;I have pretty big hands and a 50 pound dog. These bags have never ripped or torn and are the perfect size.
5;Fresh, wonderful Cinnamon smell;I purchased this cinnamon to use in holiday baking and to replace my old outdated spices. I could care less about the raging health debate on which type of cinnamon is best eaten for health reasons.
3;Container problem;I have used these little treats for our 2 dogs for a while and never had a problem.  This time the container arrived a little dented and when I opened it, discovered that the inside pouch had been damaged and the greenies are stuck together.
3;OK Tea, not bad;I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands.
4;Love 'em;I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.
5;Works great;I use three different sizes of cat food cans (kitty loves variety), and these lids fit them all. Also, if you care about that sort of thing, it's a very cute design.
5;Great buy!;I bought this coconut oil because my older sister uses it on her skin at night and she has such smooth, wrinkle-free skin. I love this stuff.
1;Absolutely, ridiculously GROSS!;I honestly had to get a second opinion on whether or not this stuff was spoiled when I opened it up, gave it to my son, and he acted like I'd put a stinging wasp in his mouth! I have never seen him hate something like this.  He spewed everything in his mouth all over the room.
5;NUT BROWN ALE ROCKED;I purchased this product for my husband who has been home brewing for a few months now. The<br />beer had a good color, smelled & tasted great.
1;Poor cocoa flavor and tastes funny;I would not recommend this cocoa to anyone.  The flavor is horrible - it is weak and then there are other flavors in it (kinda like incense).
5;Received Wasa Crispbread in great condition;My husband and I love Wasa Crispbread. I found it available at Amazon,com at a<br />much better price than in the supermarket so I bought a case of 12 packs.
3;Cat now can't stop licking, biting, scratching his own body?;I thought this food was good because my cat's picky digestive system seemed to tolerate it pretty well. This was until the puking started and the obsessive grooming.
5;Really works for hairballs!;Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats.
1;Warning: Contains Menadione;According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects.
5;Nothing Beats Shake 'N Bake For Flavor!;I'm a Shake 'N Bake HOUND.  I admit it.
4;Great Gift!;The gift set looks pretty nice upon arrival.  I bought as a gift for my grandmother and she loves it!  Really nice, clean scent.
4;Nice strong flavor and aroma;Chocolate, honeyed pecans and bourbon.  What's not to like?  The aroma is fantastic.
4;Is that all?;The noodles were great--both kids liked them!--and I was very happy with the price until I realized that I was going through this pasta twice as fast as the organic wheat, at twice the price.  So if you don't mind paying a lot more for quinoa, it's a great product.
5;Great Popcorn!;Great popcorn - way better than the 'normal' stuff I've been buying from the supermarket for years. The popcorn comes out sweet - just add a little salt and you're good to go.
5;Best Coffee, Ever.;This coffee will make you realize that Starbucks' coffee is total crap.  Hawaiian Kona Coffee is worth every penny, but beware that after drinking this, all other coffee will taste like ash in comparison.
5;Best kibble ever!;"This is by far the best kibble for cats available. Cats are obligate carnivores, they do not need to eat corn or rice, a major ingredient in most ""premium"" and all supermarket brands."
4;Raspberry Tea with Hibiscus--What a Combo!;****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid.
4;Good salt;The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.
5;Very tasty bars;There are many varieties of bars on the market these days.  I like Kind Plus and tried several varieties.
5;Great Tasting Organic Candy - Oxymoron?  No!;Wow, this is a lot of lollipops!  Here's what I got:<br /><br />36 = Very Cherry<br />59 = Pomegranate Pucker<br />32 = Strawberry Smash<br />40 = Wetface Watermelon<br />40 = Blueberry Tooberry<br />48 = Sour Apple Tart<br />33 = Mango Tango<br />34 = Googly Grape<br />====================<br />322 Total Lollipops<br /><br />Shipping was free and relatively fast.<br /><br />At $30 for a 5 lb.
5;pill pockets;Work very good with a finicky, hard to please cat, but the size is abit large for my cat because he takes very small chews, cut it down and it works like a charm.  Have to make sure the bag is resealed tightly as it is a soft consistency and will  harden, and be of no use.
5;Great value;My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell.
5;Drink The Spirit of Aloha!;I purchased these for my mom and she loves them!  She does not like bold coffee flavors, but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties.  This one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth, nutty flavor.
5;Love Larabars!;After a recommendation from my personal trainer, I tried Larabars for the first time.  She gave me a bar to try and I was hooked immediately.
5;Love it but can't get it!;My husband is a tea snob.  I found this by accident and he absolutely LOVED it.
2;RECENT TALK WITH CUSTOMER RELATIONS RE BPA LINER;"Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid."
5;We love them, but not for everyone;Okay, we try as hard as we can to eat as little sugar and as little white flour as we can, but it is hard, one still needs sweets and snacks, especially with kids.  These are great, 100% whole wheat, and sweetened with fruit juice instead of a more refined sugar.
3;"Just ""OK""";My wife and I really love Genmaicha tea, and we've had it from several tiny tea shops and purchased loose leave tea from those shops and the taste has always been fantastic. We have a larger tea purveyor that sells strictly Tao of Tea, and we purchased a tin to replenish our supplies.
5;The Best;"This is by far the best tea you can buy.  I am English and know a good ""cuppa"" when I find it."
5;SIMPLY THE BEST;If you love macaroon texture and you love almond flavor - these are for you.  They are by far the best cookies I have ever had in a macaroon.
5;Excellent cream for dogs, too.;Have you ever owned a dog whose skin was extra sensitive and hard to calm? Have you gone nuts trying to get your dog to stop biting himself and chewing on irritated spots? Here's an answer that has worked wonderfully for our Rottie:<br /><br />This cream is the only thing that I have used that calms my poor Rottweiler's skin. We live in the mountains, and nobody can figure out what he has, but it makes him itch so badly that he chews his fur off where there is irritation.
1;Steak sauce undercover;"This ""Hot Sauce"" takes more like a cheap steak sauce.  It was disgusting."
2;Disappointed;I took a chance on this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read.  The package arrived within three days of ordering, and the coffee was sealed in a standard vacuum-sealed bag.
5;Great Flavor;This flavor of Jello is rarely available in the grocery stores in our area.  I use it frequently in a variety of recipes.
4;Great value;My wife and I eat anchovies by the pound. No, not on pizzas or in salads only.
5;My dog loves it!;I have a Weimaraner puppy that I got at 8 months old he was a little underweight and I was having trouble keeping him from losing weight because he can be nervous in new situations. Since he lived in the counrt and moved to the city everything was new.
1;Where's that wonderful aroma?;I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla.
3;These are ok but not excellent;The skins are tough.  It ruins the flavor.
5;Tasty Malt Candy;If you love the flavor of malted barley, i.e.
1;Strong Bitter Aftertaste;"I bought this Culinary grade Matcha powder based on many good reviews but was very disappointed! I like to bake green tea cookies and cakes but unfortunately the bitter after taste just makes my baked goods very unpalatable (using 1-3 tsp per batch). I previously used a store bought Matcha from Japan which cost twice as much and was not specified ""culinary grade"" and compared the two."
2;gross;Would not purchase again.  Very artificial vanilla taste.
5;Great product, highly reccomended!;I have been drinking Orgain pretty much since it was released on the market a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed it. Its a great alternative to all the other nutritional/protein shakes out there since it is all organic.
2;This is not premium quality tea;I agree with the other reviewers.  Stash has some great teas, but this is not one of them.
5;Even non tea drinkers will love this tea;Bentley's Mango White Tea is the best tea I have ever had. I drink alot of tea and someone at work brought this in and I tried it.
4;Creamy and fast to make in a pinch;I like instant coffee during the winter months to curl up with while watching TV and when I am home alone and don't want to brew a whole pot.  This coffee is sweet, spicy and fragrant with cinnamon notes and the taste of pumpkin it is a taste of indulgence.
5;My wife, organic green tea lover...loves this tea!;My wife only drinks organic decaf green tea.  I bought this as a surprise and she loves it.
5;Cats love it;After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.
5;Feldkamp Pumpernickel Bread;This is the best pumpernickel bread around. I first purchased a single loaf in a specialty store.
5;Texture and the taste are totally different from the pressed oats!;I have been having Quaker Oatmeal for yesrs until trying this today! The texture and the taste are completely different from the pressed oat. It worths cooking for half hour.
5;Mouth Watering & Addictive;These bars are the best health bars I've ever eaten.  They are are moist and sweet.
5;We enjoy this tea every morning.;I have been purchasing this tea for years.  We drink it every morning instead of coffee, and love it.
4;Love peanut butter but hate the fat;Although it doesn't compare to Jif, which is my favorite PB, it is very good. I do miss the salt though, so I add just a pinch.
1;Gooey tea!;When I received this tea, it was all clumped together from moisture.  I had to try to break it apart and I didn't succeed.
4;Dark, rich, coffee taste;I love drinking illy coffee and it's great that they offer it in can form. For me, it's too dark and bitter, but it is still a great and bold flavor for those who prefer it.
5;DisposaKup Lids;The cup lids are just just great. So much easier to refill and reuse the cups.
5;Good price on organic sugar;Organic sugar is hard to find and usually comes in small packages.  While this does indeed come in 12 bags of 1.
4;Best among the decaf's;I have been favorably impressed with all of the Barry's Tea line. For a decaffeinated tea, this one is indeed very good.
2;NASTY!!;I will never understand why they put Splenda into non-diet drinks but I can tell you that it was a horrible idea. So diet is undrinkable and so is regular.
5;Don't buy it used;"Its a great product, and our dog loves them.  But I see that Amazon lists some sellers of ""used and new""."
5;OMG I love these chips;The Glories Kettle Sweet Potato Chips (12-pack/5 oz each) arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good these chips taste.
1;Still not working;I received this product three months ago.  The first seeds started to grow then died within a few weeks.
5;Love this coffee maker!;My husband bought this for us for an early Christmas. We have been using it for about a month and we love it.
1;Beware of this product!;It is impossible to find an ingredient list!<br /><br />On the internet the ingredients start with whole milk powder and vanilla, and nothing else.<br /><br />What about sugar and cocoa butter?<br /><br />If you call Ghirardelli, they will tell you, they don't have an ingredient list!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Trader Joes only carries white chocolate chips around Christmas.
5;Actual Coconut!;I have to admit I'm floored by this product.  I'm originally from the West Indies so needless to say I love coconut.
5;Best pancakes ever!;This makes the best pancakes ever. The muffins and other items are good too with this all-purpose mix.
4;Wacky and original;Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's 2nd film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure and it's his most popular next to Batman. A lot of films such as Monkey Bone have tried to copy it's strange originality and have failed.
5;Love these chips!;We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation. I wasn't sure what to expect by the package, and at first bite I didn't know what to think.
5;A cello in comparison to the violin of orange blossom honey;Manuka has a strong, deep, rich flavor, suggesting essences of fig, tannin, and molasses. This is honey to be savored.
5;Awesome;These are delicious treats for people of all ages. I got $100 for eating these and they were surprisingly delicious.
1;100% Crushed Fruit?;"This is not ""100% crushed fruit"". Nor is it ""pureed fruit"", as the Dr."
5;Incredible flavor, perfect on crusty baguette;This cheese is amazing. I tend to just buy it at Whole Foods, but it's good to know you can get it in more than one place.
5;My cats love it!!!;My fussy cats love this food and from what I've read, it's good for them, too.  Finally, we both win.
3;vanilla disflavored;The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.
5;Love these Sticks;When Costco stopped carrying these I was elated to find them at Amazon. They're great and are low calorie too boot.
3;do not buy it online;I have used this brand before. it was much better than those I got from amazon.
5;Luzianne green tea for iced tea;This is excellent green tea and I am grateful I could find it on Amazon as none of the grocery stores around here carry it, nor does Walmart. It make a superior iced green tea for those of us that prefer green tea.
3;Not good...;I decided to try this food with my 13 years old dog. He didn't like the taste, I had to combine it with something else for him to eat it.
2;Taste terrible, way too strong;Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.
4;Good Product;These snack bars are so tasty. The only downside is how small they are but what can you expect for only 100 calories.
4;Basically a laxative...;I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best.
5;Yummy!!;My husband has never drank coffee and now he wants this all of the time. Really great flavor!! Taste just like a chocolate glazed donut.
5;My Jack Russel LOVES these!;My 13 year old Jack Russell who is still full of life, has decreased kidney function. I was in search of treats with out crude protein.
3;Sue;I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.
4;50 bucks for licorice?!;I ate six of these right off the bat. Delicious but not overly sweet, with only a hint of pomegranate that tastes more like conventional cherry licorice.
5;Great gift;I bought one of these for myself and one for a gift.  It is elegant and practical.
5;Really works for hairballs!;Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats.
1;Pork gelatin!!!!!;I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place.
5;Baby loves this food!;This food is not as smooth as some of the others and is a mixture of 4 foods, so I didn't start feeding it to my baby until he was 6-7 months old.  He's 9 months old now and still loves it, and I think it's better now that it isn't as smooth.
5;It's like a real pet, only dead!;When my son reached the age of having pets, we thought long and hard about what to get him. sure, we had taught him that pets meant cleaning, feeding, looking after.
4;Pretty good Coffee;I'm a guy who likes coffee..
2;Not very good;It tastes kind of fake, like fake sugar, fake cream and is too sweet, the vanilla flavor isn't that great either. I won't be buying these again.
5;Excellent!;I love these bars.  They are lighter and crisper than the nature valley brand.
2;Peach Tea;"We found very little peach flavor in this ""peach tea"".  It is a poor substitute for Twinings."
2;Very Light;"I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the ""light roast"" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup."
2;Reimbursment Pending;I only received one package instead of ten:  there are ten 'packages' of six cookies in each box but that equates to $1.05 per ounce, not $.
5;Finest Around In My Opinion;My husband and I are always searching for better coffee..
4;Prtein Chips;As endorsed by Dr. Oz, these chips do satisfy and are quite tasty.
3;Bought at my local supermarket;I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[.
5;Good Seed;I used the seeds for a Biology project where I had to grow a plant and test the effect of pH on growth rate, but I am a terrible with plants!! I can not grow anything or keep what plants i buy alive!  I am the opposite of a green thumb, a black thumb if you will.  These seeds came within three days of ordering them and in great condition.
5;PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!;Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.
5;Great salt;This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one.
5;Great product great price;Again you cannot beat having this delivered to the house direct. This is a fantastic product to have on hand for spaghetti sauce or soups or just to drink.
5;Culinary secret;Someone recently gave me a small grinder containing pink Himalayan rock salt crystals.  The difference in the taste it added to food prompted me to do some reading on the differences.
2;Sweeter than I'm used to;I love chocolate, and indulge in it regularly. When I buy bar chocolate, I always buy dark.
2;Buyers Beware...;For those of you out there that are new to gluten free foods..
2;too much salt and presumably some preservatives;Too much salt, and I think they add some preservatives.<br />It is not the worst product ever but I don't like it.
5;Well Worth it!;I first tried this tea at a Mercedes Benz dealership and I was hooked.  I have tried many different types of herbal teas in the past and Mighty Leaf tea is one of the best tasting teas (in my opinion -very flavorful).
5;LOVE IT !!!;We got one of these at a winery and took it to a group function and it was a major hit ! I didn't want to share with anyone, ha ha. Needless to say we had to go back to the winery and get another one.
5;Excellent;I prefer using dried beans as opposed to canned for various reasons. These chickpeas are an excellent product
3;Good and tasy product - but price is lot  higher now.;My 2 stars are not for the product as such.  The hot dogs are very good and offer an excellent alternative.
5;These contain a fair amount of SOY...if you have a sensitivity...;Popchips Original Potato Chips are dee-lish.  But BEWARE of the SOY in them if you have a soy sensitivity, like I do.
5;Fragrant Chamomile flower herbal tea;
4;Very good but the original flavor is much better.;another wonderful product by Vita.  Nice and fresh w/tropical flavor.
5;Best gravy mix ever.;I use this gravy mix for everything. I don't even bother to make gravy from scratch any more.
1;faulty packaging and unresponsive customer service;I ordered this product because it was organic and easy when out and about with my baby.  However, we I received my order, one of the pouches I noticed had been punctured and was moldy.
5;A very fine Tea;This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it.
5;Fresh and Gone!;They were fresh when they arrived. I purchased this 6-pack for $7.
5;Heaven in a cup;Ordered this coffee only because the flavor enticed me - Chocolate Caramel Brownie.  I've had other chocolate flavored coffee before but this one I found<br />to be exceptionally good.
5;My dog loves it.;I have a Papillon and he loves this stuff. He's very energetic and happy and has had no health issues so far while on this food.
5;Best Dog Treats Ever - No dental problems;I have been using checkups for about 3 years. First with my two large dogs ( 55 and 65lbs).
3;The gift for tea drinkers;This makes a nice gift for a dedicated tea drinker and Stash Tea has tea flowers. Not worth more than the $18.
5;Quality Vanilla;This extract tastes excellent and a little goes a long way. I've been using it for about a year now.
5;The Best Popcorn Salt;I am so picky when it comes to my popcorn and this salt is the best I have ever had. It tastes like movie theater popcorn salt and is all I now use.
5;Jelly Babies by Bassetts;The Fourth Doctors favorite snack which I have not been able to get here in the US in a long time. They are simply wonderful, I have purchased these time and time again and see no reason to stop now.
1;Gas anyone?;Delicious cereal but the intense intestinal gas and cramping I will not be buying this one anymore. I am actually in a slight amount of pain.
5;Flavorful Seasoning;Seasoning is very tasty and filling. Will use it again.
5;Delicious, great for the morning;I purchased these K-Cups for myself at our office based on the low price per cup. I didn't have very high expectations as these are roughly half the cost of most K-Cups.
5;Great for Marathon Training;I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.
5;Excellent;This product is excellent!  Great tasting popcorn, perfect amount of butter and salt.  Will purchasd this again when i run out.
5;Ferrets favorite treats;All my Ferrets have to do is hear the bag being opened and they are up and ready to receive their treats. This is their favorite treat of all time! That is why we bought a case.
5;Yummy;These taste great. While here on amazon these are listed for a lower price than the strawberry ones they still are higher than when I go to the local store.
5;This stuff works;I'm an ER doctor and work long hours - sometimes day shifts and sometimes night shifts. I've always struggled with finding something healthy I could take to stay awake.
4;Herbalife Lift Off;I found this works best if you take it first thing in the morning before eating or having coffee.<br />In about an hour you feel an energy surge that lasts about 4 hours.
1;This crap made my puppy sick, don't buy!!!!;I recently purchased this food for my 5 month old black lab mix. When I first adopted him several months ago, I started him on Wellness puppy food.
5;Amazing!;Woah..
1;50.99?!?!?!?;I wouldn't pay $50.99 for 12 of these if my mother was on fire and had to douse out the flames, that is a ridiculous price.
5;These things are GREAT!;These are the best things Werther's has ever done!  However, I should warn you that they are addictive.  If you like chewy candies and butterscotch - you will be pleased.
2;Poor Packaging;I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them.
4;Not as good as the Beef (no msg);Have tried the Chicken flavored one of this brand--YUCK!! This one isn't as good as the beef, but it's not too bad for the price. Bases are way overpriced for the most part, and since I also like to use it as  bouillon, this one is OK.
5;Excellent product!;Much cheaper than in stores, and fast shipping. I love Bob's Red Mill products.
5;Roland Quinoa, Prewashed;I like prewashed quinoa the best because there is no waste from draining those tiny little seeds and there is no trace of bitterness.  So convenient!  I am a vegan and Roland prewashed quinoa gives me the required daily amount of protein.
5;Great bulb - great price;I bought these bulbs because the price was the best I could find - even at home depot. They arrived on time and all of the bulbs are working great.
1;Worst meat snack I ever tried;They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.
1;Terrible;This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.
5;I would use again.;The product was as described, arrived fast and I definitely would recommend it. I had no problems  and it was packaged with care.
5;dog treats;There isn't much my puppy won't do or try to do for one of<br />the freeze dried liver treats. Gave one to another Springer Spaniel<br />we met at the beach and now when I see him he races, sometimes<br />a long distance, to great me and get another treat.
5;Beef bons;dogs thought these were quite a treat. and having to very large dogs I was pleased by how long they lasted.
3;Good but......;Good  but they only sent 19 k-cups in the box.  The mix was supposed to be at least 8 different ciders and 8 different cocoas.
2;Better off making your own blend.;I really wanted to like this one-stop-shop for my morning run out the door. However, the taste is getting in the way.
5;Best Fat Free Hot Cocoa Mix ever!!;Was able to purchase this item in grocery stores in Oklahoma City.  Not so after I moved to Cape Coral.
4;Greg's Big TAZO Story;"I discovered Tazo Earl Grey by finding some ""cases"" of it for sale in a store up in Washington state. $9 for a case of 6 boxes: good deal."
4;Gas station cappuccino;This is not your Starbucks cappuccino, but your gas station cappuccino.  Tastes just like what comes out of the machine at the gas station- if you like those, you'll love these K-Cups.
5;The best Tea ever Plantation Mint Yummm;This tea is the most pleasant tea you will ever drink as far as mint is concerned.  Frome the time you tear it open, to the time you add the water, you can smell the mint, and its soothing qualities begin to work their magic.
1;Compleats cheese & spinach ravioli - horrible taste;I can't believe this item was even approved by FDA. Maybe it was just this one packet - but it tasted like I was eating chemicals or something.
4;Very tasty spread - would definitely get it again.;We ordered two jars of the Amish spreads, which arrived today.<br />The seller packs carefully, and the jars arrived quickly and in fine shape.
5;Iams cat food, weight control;We are unable to find this product in very many stores.  We have a number of cats, some senior,regular adult and some younger.
5;A good after workout snack;I purchased these to snack on after my workouts. Now I find myself just snacking on them all the time!! They're really good and come in a variety of flavors.
4;A convenient source;When this product was unavailable in my town, I found Amazon to be a good source. THe product was as advertised and I would trade again.
4;eating healthy cost so much more;I am trying to eat a better diet. I am making smoothies at home with some items I had never heard of before.
5;fat freehot coca mix;I've been buying Nestle's fat free hot coca for years. When my market no longer carried it, someone suggested I try amazon.
3;"Yowsa! Schedule a dentist's visit before ""biting"" into one of these!";First of all, let me say the flavor is great. A bit of spice, nothing overwhelming, and a hint of pumpking, nothing overwhelming.
5;LOVE LOVE LOVE;I was first introduced to Bakery on Main at a local GF Food Fair. I am still in the learning stages of finding out more about being GF but I have a 2 year old that is Gluten Intolerant and I needed to find a snack food I could trust for her to eat.
4;Fluoride Content An Issue?;Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.
5;Absolutely love it!;I was looking into ReishiMushroom and came across this brand of coffee that already has it mixed in!<br /><br />First of all I'm not much of a Coffee drinker..
5;Yes, I have an addiction.;"I call these ""Cheesee Poofs""  and yes I am adicted to them.<br />They are very hard to find, so ordering a box of 12 is WONDERFUL!<br /><br />They are the tastiest, bestest cheese fuffs available on the market."
5;Very tasty soup;This was a great base for vegetable soup.  You could easily add meat or other things but it was good just by itself.
4;Pretty good - but horrible price!;I agree with another reviewer.<br /><br />I ordered this from another site for $4.
5;So Good!;This cereal is great! I always try my little ones food before I give it to her. This tasted so good I eat it for breakfast now.
5;The Best;I have tried all the K-Cup coffee's and I always come back to this one, it sounds like a foo-foo drink but the aroma and taste make it a good cup of coffee anytime of day, and the price is right too.  I buy two fifty packs and that comes out to just a little over four cents for a twelve ounce cup of coffee.
1;Do NOT buy these;Despite the picture, these are NOT Philippine Brand mangoes but are a much-inferior Royal brand. Read the fine print.
2;Did not taste good;I have been looking for gum drops for a long time and was excited about getting these.  I was disappointed.
4;Stash Teas;I discovered Stash Teas with the receipt of a gift basket.  I was so impressed with the robust flavors and aromas that I searched out their product line and bought several larger boxes (100 bags per box0.
5;Yummy and sweeeeet;This syrup is used for my Key Lime Pie martini, which is awesome!  The product is very sweet and sugars up if saved for a long time after it is opened. I wish Monin would make a sugar free version of this flavor, but no luck yet.
5;About marantas and their care;I love marantas! Here I only rate them as house plants. I will rate the ones offered on Amazon when I purchase them.
3;The liver flavor is better;Neither of my dogs likes this flavor as much as the liver flavor. One of my dogs spits this cracker flavor out, while she will happily eat the liver crackers all day.
5;Probably not smart to order in the summertime;I love this product and have been ordering it for several months. Just got my latest order and the contents were melted and it had leaked all over the box.
5;Very tasty but not very Habanero-y;"This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming."
4;Pineapple? No thanks.;The coconut water tastes good, it's like most other coconut waters on the market. Good coconut flavor, a little salty from the electrolytes, but overall pretty good.
3;Good product.  Too bad it doesn't agree with me.;I ordered the 3-pound bag of Nutiva 50% Protein Hemp Powder at the beginning of July.  I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.
5;A Special Treat for Anyone, Especially for Dieters;Everyone has their own personal tastes, but to me this is a Wow. Why so? First I love the taste.
5;Tried them all but THESE ARE THE BEST!!!  (no nausea!);I LOVE this pills - that seems weird to say - but they're fantastic.  I started taking them to supplement my prenatal pills a long time ago after reading a ton of articles about how important DHA is to the brain development of your baby.
5;My favorite Earl Grey;I started ordering this packing last year to donate to my shul so we can have better tea at Kiddush.  The tea stays fresh in the packing, and it is the most economical way to purchase my favorite Earl Grey tea.
3;Sometimes, they will gluten you.;I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.
5;Best Cracker - Bar None;I originally was attracted to this cracker because 3 of them are only 50 calories and 1/5 gram of saturated fat.  What I found was that they are delicious too.
5;Best out there;This is the only catnip my cats like. I have tried other kinds and not one of them shows a bit of interest and I have 5 cats.
5;Granola, Fruit and Nut;This is a great tasting granola.  It is good as a cereal or as a snack.
1;Mine came moldy...;The peppers were starting to mold in all 10 bags. Some were really bad.
3;Great Movie Which SCREAMS for a Special Edition DVD;I won't go into detail about the movie itself, which has been reviewed in much greater detail and much better than I can do at the moment (it is one of my all time favorite movies - 5 stars).  I'd like to focus on the DVD for a moment.
5;This is so good!!!;The best nutritional yeast I've ever tasted.  It's fantastic on and in both sweet and savory food and is good eaten plain too.
5;Excellent;I never had a brown rice vermicelli before but these noodles were not a disappointment. They were delicious.
3;It's just ok;This syrup need more flavor-it tasted like regular syrup with some pecan pieces thrown in.  All the pieces of pecan float to the top and fall out on the first serving.
5;Best stuff e erM;My family loves this.  I use it  cooking, we sprinkle it on just about everything that we eat.
5;Easy help to enjoying your peanut butter faster;I just used the peanut butter mixer for the first time and I love this thing.<br /><br />I used to dread mixing the natural peanut butter because all the oil would go all over the place and it would never mix thoroughly.
5;I own a finicky shih-tzu!;I own a shih tzu that hardly eats anything, and as far as treats go will only eat Happy Hips and (groan!)- Snausages!  Unbelievable!  He'll turn his nose up at filet mignon, but will wolf down a Snausage!  Of course I would rather he eat something somewhat healthy and I have bought many 15 oz. bags of Happy Hips treats through local merchandisers for around $18.
5;Easy and Baby Loves It;My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.
5;Outstanding product!;I've been reading about White Lily flour for years, but was never able to give it a try.  Let me tell you, the biscuits and pancakes in my house have taken a giant turn for the better.
4;I liked this when I could get it.;I used,to get this all the time, before stores stopped carrying it. Then switched to manwich thick & chunky.
5;a winner;They are sweet without being just another blob of solid corn syrup.  They have a wonderful fruit flavor and smell divine.
5;If you love popcorn, you need theis product;I have been trying different types of toppings for popcorn for the last several years and this is by far the best for just plain popcorn. The product arrived within a couple of days after I ordered it well packaged.
4;Hartz;The reason I buy on Amazon is the price. I can't find this product anywhere else cheaper.
5;Very sour but baby loves it;This is probably my toddler's favorite pouch.  I have to admit, there's a lot of lemon juice in this mix, which makes the pouch somewhat sour.
5;wow, the only soy I use now;Now I know what that little something is that I am missing when I cook at home compared to eating at my favorite fusion eatery. This has such a distinctive flavor and it's hard to describe.
1;Bad looking pretzels;We received the package in a clear bag with no label.  The pretzels look old and many were broken.
5;Perfect for my needs;The product was delivered quickly and in good shape. The king-sized chocolate bars are perfect for my needs and Amazon is an excellent place to buy them.
4;keeps cookies tasting fresh and crunchy;These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.
5;Creamy Broccoli Soup;Another winning soup from Imagine. The flavor is great! I love that this soup is organic and gluten free.
5;Ortega hits a home run;This is the absolute best taco sauce.  More of a kick than their medium version, yet not so overpowering that you have to chase down your milk jug.
3;Good Mild Coffee,  Does not hold up to larger than 8oz brew settings.;My wife and I are coffee people fans, with the Jet Fuel and WakeUp call being our very favorite K-cups.  With the WakeUp Call apparently disappearing I tried the Tree Hugger as a potential replacement and am very disappointed.
5;Great product;Great source of iodine.  A bit dry if eaten out of the package -- better in soup.
4;Yum!;If you usually eat natural peanut butter then this stuff will take you by surprise. However anyone who eats grocery store peanut butter and is trying to make the switch to cut some fat out of your diet, Butter'n makes a good substitute.
5;Wonderful teas for presentation;These were simply lovely teas to taste and see in the pot.  My guests loved the presentation.
3;Bahlsen Truffet cookies;I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted.
5;They like em'....they like em'.;My finicky cats are difficult to please particularly when it comes to their food.<br />Boy,.
5;Nice rich European style coffee;"This is only coffee I can drink nowadays. And you can also vary the taste a bit yourself by either using 1 pod and hitting the ""single"" button on the Senseo, or use 1 pod and hit the ""double"" button on the Senseo."
5;Conversion;I always relegated applesauce to the ho hum category.<br />Craving a low cal sweet treat, I gave this a try since organic preference limits my choices.
5;In Love!;I really am impressed with this shampoo. I use it and the conditioner everyday and since then my hair is twice as soft and manageable as before when I was using a very expensive shampoo pair (HealthySexyHair).
1;Not Raw!;I bought the 5 lb bag to get a deal.  I usually buy Navitas.
2;Orders vary in freshness, no longer worth this price (edit 10/2011);In August I gave this company a 5-star review after my first bag of nuts.  They were fresh and big and I was impressed.
2;Chunky thick consistency, baby doest like the taste;My daughter will eat just about any flavor from earths best, incl. Fruits, vegetables and soups.
3;Not TOO Bad;For the amount you get, this price is great. However, these aren't cookies, make sure you digest that.
5;Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker;I bought this unit for my Son and his Wife so they could use it on my very new baby Granddaughter and they absolutely love it.  It was a little pricey, but for what it does to save time for my Daughter-in-Law to make meals for my Granddaughter, it what worth it.
5;Sweet Potato Popchip Goodness!;As a kid, I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.
1;OMG.... WORST CHIPS EVER;After I saw those great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try and ordered this variety pack. And, the bottom line is they are the worst chips I've ever had.
5;amazing deal;Great deal.<br /><br />I don't drink it too often, but it gives me the jolt i need when i don't want to drink too much liquid.
5;Grove square hot cocoa cups, Dark, single serve cup;We use our Keurig every day.  When a friend gave us a sample we went crazy, it is the best hot chocolate ever.
3;Not vitamin fortified;Beware, this product is not vitamin fortified. It is probably best utilized for its fiber content.
5;Olde Thompson Garlic Sea Salt;Arrived on time and in good condition.  Love this item but can't seem to find it in any of my local grocery stores.
5;Delicious;I normally use cream in my coffee, but when I want a sweet change of pace I use this creamer. It has just the right amount of sweetnest per creamer ratio.
5;Wonderful tea! Tasty, many health benefits and naturally caffeine free.;"I l0ve Tulsi tea! This is the very same brand I used when we lived in India, which is where it is imported from. I am SO happy to find it here in the States!! Tulsi, also known as ""holy basil"" is a delicious herb, related to the basil plant, but tastes more along the lines of mint."
5;"Best ""white"" rice I've found";"This parboiled basmati is the best ""white"" rice I've found. It retains most of the benefits of brown rice, being parboiled to retain nutrients."
5;Awesome GF granola!;This granola is fantastic, as are ALL of Udi's granolas.  Not only are they gluten free, but they have an awesome simple ingredient list.
3;Decent packaging, kind of blah;I used this first on a backpacking trip and was impressed by the packaging and the idea of having an organic meal with not as much sodium as the non-organic competition's versions.  The product was easy to make and I was impressed by the consistency but the taste was pretty blah.
5;Love it;This is the first time I have tried Kind bars. I'm really impressed! I love the whole almonds and big flake coconut in the honey coating.
5;Super Delicious!;I love the Taste Nirvana coconut waters. They are a real pick-me-up during a 12-hr.
5;so yummy;Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.
5;Cats love them;I have around 7-8 cats & they all love the treats. They have learned what opening the package sounds like.
2;Not quite what I expected.;I am a bit disappointed in this product. I have tried it before when I was on my cruise.
5;Great, healthy snack;These crackers are a great way to get whole wheat into your diet & into children's.  They are low in fat & sugar, and they taste great.
5;The best!!!;"These are the best ""sugar free"" (non-enriched wheat flour) crackers I have ever eaten. These are the best & sweetened w/ fruit juice! I am on the sugar busters diet & one of the few snacks you can have is triscuits."
5;Dogs love 'em, I love 'em;My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good.
5;Great Tea @ Reasonable Price;I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas
4;Made in Taiwan but the goods are quality goods!!!!;My father recently went to Hawaii and told me about this great spice the made a big difference on eating the pineapple slices. he couldn't remember the name so with a little research I found it.
1;English Muffins???????????;These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.
5;Great Coffee, Great Price;Gloria Jean's Coffee is delicious. Hazelnut is my favorite flavor.
5;Love this product works amazing!!!;I love this product, first it was supose to get here between the 5 and 20th which made me mad, but it actually got here on the 3rd. So that was awsome!!!! Also some people say that its to thin to paint with, not at all it paints amazing!!  Looks great works great and came fast, in one word.
5;Ordered these bars for my daughter in college who's on the go...will re-order for both of us, they are soooo yummy & HEALTHY!;These Kind Bars are so good and healthy & gluten free.  My daughter came across them and loves them for a quick snack between her hectic schedule of classes & work.
5;purees better than other options;I completely agree that this item is pricey but frankly, it purees better than my blender, food mill or cuisinart can.  I tried each of the other appliances and while they certainly ground up the food, the consistency was a bit lumpy with each.
5;Perfect Dark Chocolate Experience for Lavender Lovers;*****<br />Well, this is MY dark chocolate. Creamy, lavender-y---absolutely perfect! You don't really taste the blueberries per se, as they just set off the lavender, which is subtle and perfect.
5;Great Flavor;First time I had tried Hawaiian coffee and I really liked it. Ity had a nice bold flavor and I absolutely could taste the difference as compared to my regular coffee.
4;Tea Time;A good way to find what different flavors are good and what are not.  Herbal flavor I didn't really care for.
5;Even non-diabetics approve!;I purchased these for my husband as he was recently diagnosed as diabetic.  I eat them as much as he does!  There is no strange after-taste as with some sugar-substitute enhanced foods.
5;No longer available at Starbucks;I purchased this online because these teabags are no longer available at the Starbucks stores.  They have transitioned to a new loose leaf configuration which costs more and has fewer servings.
5;Stash Tea;The tea is Premium quality as stated on the box.  I wish Amazon was carrying larger packages than the Box of 20 Tea Bags.
5;Some flavors are better than others;As a clean-eating vegan, I can't help but love everything about Larabars. Most of them taste great, and you can't beat an ingredient list this short.
4;Nice and strong - the way I like it.;I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).
4;Great value, if your cat will eat it;This food is one of the best values for high-quality cat food. My cats seemed to love it at first.
4;TONS of fiber!;I'm not a very 'regular' guy so I purchased these to have for a tasty snack and to help with regularity. Well, after having eaten about a dozen over the past few weeks I can definitely say that the fiber does its job! These taste like you're having a candy bar, very good taste.
5;Our older dogs love this!;Fabulous product for our older dogs. No upset stomach which was a problem with alot of dog foods.
4;Pretty good malt mix;Whenever I order a milk shake it's always a malted milk shake if I can get it. It just tastes better.
3;A tasty dish for curry lovers, but on the pricey side.;The Prima Taste Rendang Curry sauce kit makes a more than serviceable Rendang Curry, containing everything you'll need sans the beef, but at this price point, you might be left scratching your head as to why it's so expensive. It makes a delicious and easy-to-prepare (brown the beef, then mix, heat and eat, basically) Indonesian curry.
5;YUM;Having pamela's gluten free products delivered to our house is a lavish treat. I feel rich! I am visiting family on the the EAST coast and finding health food stores and cooperatives is not as easy as in Albuquerque.
5;These contain a fair amount of SOY...if you have a sensitivity...;Popchips Original Potato Chips are dee-lish.  But BEWARE of the SOY in them if you have a soy sensitivity, like I do.
5;UNCANNY! Must Buy! Must Have! With Kids or Without Kids!;Amazing! When you can't have a campfire and you've got the craving for S'mores, Pepperidge Farms had created an awesome FUN FISH!<br />Zany as Zany can be - Vanilla Gold Fish, Chocolate Goldfish, and of course - Marshmallow Goldfish - Stack'em up
5;KEEPER!;These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.
5;Leaves Your Hair Soft & Smelling Fantastic!;I have straight, long, highlighted hair that is thick, but looks thin. I use both shampoo and conditioner on a daily basis and I normally alternate between Herbal Essences, Pantene Pro-V and Aussie.
3;These things stink!!;I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth.
5;flavor explosion in your mouth!;Its incredible how Thai seasonings can make food taste..
3;Golden Valley Jerky Orginal;If you are into hiking, bike riding or traveling. I don't recomand this beef jerky.
5;Great Afternoon Snacks.;I enjoy these bars during the afternoon for that craving. The nut and fruit consistency is really good and the size of the bar is just enough to fill you until dinner.
5;darned tasty!;A bit higher in sodium than most of the broth/bouillon/soup-bases we use, but not bad enough to make it onto our 'not' list.<br /><br />VERY tasty, even if you use less than the recommended amount, we are still pleased with the result.
4;Very good;These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits - they're either too sweet or too bland - but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.
5;5 Hour Energy Orange;great prices i order from here 2 times a month ..
5;Very pleased with this product.;I use rye flour alot, feeding my sourdough starter and making bread. I was happy to find this organic rye flour for roughly the price I was paying for nonorganic in town.
1;Warning!! Not the same blend it was!;"This ""Level 2"" dreck is not even close to the Seattle's Best Breakfast Blend you may have enjoyed in the past. Not dark."
4;great product;Agave nectar is very low glycemic. Excellent for diabetics.
3;Stale cookies.;These cookies are always my favorite. They taste just like Famous Amos cookies! However, when I ordered them from amazon every other bag was stale even within the expiration date the taste was not the same.
3;Good, if you like salty and spicy.;These are easy to make in the microwave---good for a quick snack.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, they're kinda a one-trick-pony
5;Best Honey EVER!;Just got my first jar of this delicious antioxidant honey.  I'm very impressed and will definitely be a returning customer.
5;good;good cup of coffee. not as good as newmans for my liking, but better that the CP kona blend.
4;Pasta To Go;There is no question that when it has came down to microwavable pasta meals, they have been more of a miss than a hit, and sadly lagged upon the taste that was originally was suppose to appeal to the eyes. Barilla has known that when they have made pasta, and their microwaveable pasta meals actually stand out well.
2;Not so good;These just aren't very good.  They taste rather plastic, and don't have very much taste to them at all.
5;Pasta;This is best pasta I ever ate plus nutritional. I will never go back.
1;Impossible to use;This product was awful. Difficult to use without it sticking to your fingers.
5;Now This IS Water;Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is the kind of water I've always heard about, a tasteless beverage.
4;The Last Ding-Dong of Doom;Once I refused to accept the fall of man.<br />I shall eat my words and wash them down with this unholy pouch.
5;Love this tea!;I am a big tea drinker, I normally drink tea all day, switching to de-caf at some point during the day.  This is my first experience with Higgins & Burke English Breakfast Black tea and I am drinking it now.
1;feel like i was dupped.;saw this online as a deal. ordered some thinking I would receive 20 individually packed bars.
3;After eating, I thought, but I didn't smile much.;"I have rarely been so perplexed when I have written a review of any product, and I have written more than a few reviews. But this nutrition bar confuses me - it's not one of those ""candy bars with vitamins"" like some other bars, nor is it as nutritious as say, an apple and a handful of nuts (my usual ""meal replacement."
2;Lots of soy taste ;
5;I dont drink anything else;Ever since I tried this coffee I absolutely loved it.  I drink about 3-4 cups of coffee per day and am very picky about my coffee.
5;Awesome quality CACAO nibs;these are high quality fresh cacao nibs. great price and excellent packaging.
5;great taste . better when chilled;Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.
5;Love This;My doggy loved this.  He sniffed it out soon as the box arrived.
2;Convenient but way too many carbs and too much sugar;On its face, this seems like a quasi healthy alternative for breakfast, but no. This is something I ate before adopting a healthier lifestyle.
5;AMAZING;Trying to find a natural alternative for my acne I came across this and hooked Since my first day of college my face that was once flawless exploded into acne (I was 18 then). It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas.
4;Good STUFF - but grind it a bit finer than normal.;First, my palette coffee lends itself towards darker oily roasts from Africa and Asia rather than lighter South & Central American coffees.  So, now you know how to discount my ramblings here's my review.
5;awesome!!;Really good..
1;Ripoff;This product is $5 per bag at the store. Much less overhead online and 300% price increase.
5;Yummy;These were my moms favorite and I hadn't had them for years. They were fresh and just like I remembered! Thanks for the trip down memory lane.
5;great flavor in easy packets;This is a great product for travel.  The coffee, sugar and cream are in the packet, all you add is hot water.
5;Yorkie LOVES these;My little yourkie absolutely loves these treats. He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.
5;Nectar of the Gods!!!!;Use Agave in everything you cook or eat.  Your blood sugar will be lower and you'll be healthier.
4;PB2 works for me!;PB2 peanut butter and peanut butter chocolate are a great find.  I love the fact that it tastes great in Protein shakes or just mixed with water for my morning toast.
1;total crap;The only reason this gets one star is because you have to give it atleast that much.  This is not anything like a K-cup.
5;Great snack!;This is a sweet alternative to rice krispy bars, that are gluten free.  Perfect for lunches and travel well too.
5;Can't be 130 calories;These were SOOOOOOOOO good. I just knew I was going to be packing on the weight with these.
3;Tastes good but poor nutritional quality;The taste is great and this milk would probably good for young kids. However, I was expecting higher protein content since its milk, and unfortunately there is just way too much sugar.
5;Delicious and multi-purpose!;These bars are THE BEST! They are my go-to bar whether it be for a quick breakfast or a guilt free snack. Tasty and filling and the extra protein is a bonus.
5;Great!!;I have been hunting for a decent treat for my GSD.  She just had TPLO surgery and has been recovering nicely.
5;A quality 'Traditional Breakfast Tea' at a value price;Until Twining's decided United States customers who enjoyed their Traditional English Breakfast Tea were not important and no longer worth the effort (yes, I know you can still buy their Breakfast Tea for Americans in the Orange tin, but not the traditional) I was not familiar with Ahmad Teas.  As I was searching for a quality replacement I tried this tea and Eureka!  It is an ideal Traditional English Breakfast Tea.
5;Delicious snack;These all-natural multigrain tortilla chips/crackers are very tasty.  Just like the restaurant tortilla chips you nibble on while waiting for your meal, these are slightly salty, crispy, and chewy, and I wanted to keep eating them even when the bag was all gone.
3;Fair;"These cookies would be better if the base dough recipe was the same as the Extreme Chocolate Mini Cookies with the addition of dark chocolate chunks.  As they are, they are more sweet than chocolate, and shouldn't in any way be considered a ""dark"" chocolate."
5;Delicious!;The Green Mountain Island Coconut coffee was quite delicious.  We were happy to see this flavor in the K-Cup selection and it lived up to its name.
5;The perfect food;I also purchased this product in glass containers. It was a bit of a mess.
5;highest qulaity treat for your dog;This is a top-notch company & my dogs love their treats. These are the most sought after treat for my 2 labs
1;not good;about 1 in 10 pieces actually taste like teriyaki and several pieces were VERY SPICY HOT. not tender and not a good value.
5;Delicious!;These organic fruit snacks are fantastic and enjoyed by the entire family. The packet is small, but contains just enough to get one's fill of these sweets.
5;if you are Celiac you'll love these crackers;We have loved the KA-ME Black Sesame and Soy crackers but have been unable to purchase them locally. What a great deal from Amazon!! A case was far less than the grocery store price (when available) and sooooo convenient.
5;YUMMY!!!;This is the perfect gift for anyone  who is a snacker that doesn't like the usual food gifts (meat and cheese, candy, etc). I purchased this for my husband for Valentine's and I was quite pleased with the quality.
5;Good ground coffee at a great value;"This purchase was an Amazon ""Today's Deals"" that we took a chance on because of the price. We purchased three bags for $10."
5;Hard to Believe it is Sugar Free;With the summer heat, a cool drink it what hits the spot.  You could drink something like Snapple, but at such a lower cost and just as good (if not better) are these Crystal Light Drink Mixes.
1;disappointing;This product didn't repel the raccoons
2;Good but not perfect;These bags do the job.  They are good quality and I have yet to find one that has a defect.
5;Extremely Good;I have bought this in stores before.  It is extremely good, and puts most any other chocolate you are going to find to shame.
5;Bad Habit;I was buying this at a cider mill in the fall and kept eating it hoping it was healthier than potato chips.  Once the cider mill closed, good kettle corn was hard to find until I looked on Amazon.
1;Surprised;When my regular buffalo jerky was discontinued from the subscribe & save program I chose this item.  I have had & enjoyed other Golden Valley products in the past so I chose this one without reading the reviews.
5;excellent risotto;Excellent value for especially good carnaroli rice
5;Ginger Extract;It's all it's cracked up to be. I will be ordering more when I run out.
3;Cute Little Gift Set - Just Not For Fans of the REALLY Hot Stuff!;"I picked up one of these little ""spicy 12-packs"" last year from a hot sauce shop in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I've long been a fan of the Dave's range of sauces and was very taken with the little miniature sampler bottles and the chance to try out so many of their sauces for a relatively good price."
4;Binge-o-rific;I really like Back to Nature products. These cookies are like crack! I would recommend only buying them if you have company or you might end up doing like I did once and eat the entire box in one sitting.
2;Does not look like photo;I bought a single package of this from a supermarket at a reduced price as it was 1 month before its Best Before date.<br />The product photo shows fresh chunks of potatoes, carrots & green peppers.
1;Racchette;We did not like this at all. I was disappointed.
5;Hawwian Ice Flavors;I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.
5;Very Addictive;This is a great guarana soda from brazil. It tastes unique from any soda in the united states.
5;Exactly as expected;I'm not sure of the other reviewer's expectations, but I ordered this having grown up eating this stuff every time I visited my grandparents.  It was exactly as I remembered: pickled herring as they do all over (coastal) Europe.
4;Almost perfect instant bouillon;I was a bit concerned when I first opened one of these - the powder really doesn't smell very good. Once it's dissolved in water, however, it smells great and has a really nice, savory flavor.
5;Just the thing;I love the taste of a full bodied coffee. This is why I have an espresso machine.
5;Consistently good and strong;This tea is full-bodied and subtle. As another reviewer wrote, a little does go a long way, and the price is excellent.
5;great dog food;My dog Denali loves the Ziwi Peak food.  It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume.
5;Excellent! My dog's skin looks amazing and he loves this food!;I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood.
3;Meh- mediocre dark chocolate;I had high expectations of this chocolate as I've enjoyed other Newman's Own products.  However, this dark chocolate left much to be desired.
4;not what we expected :);we were sketchy about ordering this sampler pack, because of pervious reviews. but this is not what we expected.
5;my favorite coffee;This stuff is awesome, perfect flavor and strength. gives you a wonderful foam on top, and is never bitter, actually gives you a nice size cup of coffee, unlike the lorenzo brand.
5;These cans will always arrive severely dented but the contents are delicious;When buying very large cans from Amazon.com, you should expect all of the cans to arrive either slightly dented or severely dented.
2;Just because it's not Orange doesn't make it healthy.;"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep."
5;Excellent flavor and price;This coffee  has great flavor for us strictly DECAF coffee drinkers. Priced good too! Amazon is the way to go if you need this type of coffee for your maker.
4;can be used espresso and regular drip;always liked lavazza.  there is no bitter aftertaste and find it both good for esspresso maker and regular drip depending on the strength that you like.
5;My favorite coffee;I first had this coffee when i was in costa rica a few years ago, and since have purchased directly from the distributor.  Come to find it on amazon, you actually save a little bit in shipping for the same product.
5;Taste great;These are really good tasting lentils. The first thing I notice was the lack of that shinny coating you see on store bought lentils.
3;Easy, small portions - but taste is underwhelming;Jimmy Dean Country Gravy / B000H153W2<br /><br />I bought this gravy mix because I do prefer to buy bulk online and my `usual' brand wasn't available on Amazon, but I have mixed feelings about the results.<br /><br />For what it's worth, there's no sausage flecks in the actual mix, so that picture on the front is just a serving suggestion.
4;I like the taste!;I've been drinking 2 cups a day for several months.  I just read the description above and I can say I have not lost 1 ounce drinking this coffee!  Well, nor have I lost anything on a low carb diet--I just like the food better--but that's neither here nor there.
4;A very good middle-of-the-road blend for those who just want a plain old cup of coffee...;The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild.
1;Not like at the stadium;I was so disappointed that I threw them all out.  I don't know why it tastes so good at the stadium.
2;Very poor quality;"The taste of this k-cup is great. It's not as bold as some of the other k-cups I enjoy, but it's the smoothest of all in the ""extra bold"" category."
5;Delicious;I really do enjoy these Planters Roasted Almonds with sea salt.  I have become a sea salt fan.
5;Best Ever.;These are the best veggie chips ever.  Really.
4;Good Coffee but Price could be Better;Check your grocer before you buy from Amazon.  On a normal day, Publix's price for this coffee is $9.
5;good stuff;this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs.
2;hard to tell if it is working;Although it is hard to judge this product with only trying it once, I cannot give any real proof that it does give one energy or the immune system.<br /><br />The taste is tart
5;Hibiscus Flowers;Researchers in Taiwan have found that an extract of hibiscus flower contains some of the same health-giving compounds as red wine and tea. Many folk medicine traditions use the hibiscus flower to treat high blood pressure and liver problems.
4;Ludicrous Price for Amazon;The price for these k-cups on Amazon is ludicrous.  They are actually cheaper in a department store paying sales tax.
3;Misunderstood;"My dog still enjoyed these as a quick treat.  I was under the impression that at least the 2"" - 6"" pieces would be solid."
5;Better than an almond joy bar;If you love almond joy candy bars like me, or coconut, you will love this sinfully healthy snack bar.  It is so delicious that you forget you are eating healthy! Highly recommend this tasty treat.
3;&lt;
2;not awful;Due to certain specific health issues, I need to avoid too much caffeine as well as acidic food and beverages. I was hoping that this coffee would be a good option for me, as it claims to be a dark roast - dark roast coffees being lower in acid than medium or lighter roast coffees.
5;Bariani California;This oil has a excellant taste and a pleasant aroma. It is well worth the price.
5;You'll notice a difference!;I have tried various cat foods that are high protein, and this is one of my cat's favorites. But I suggest you alternate various kinds of food over any given week--if they're on sale I often feed my cat cooked chicken wings or thighs, fish, or whatever he likes that we happen to be eating.
5;Worked like a charm!;Only thing worse than the pantry moths is finding their offspring in your food.  Ugg!!  These traps work great.
5;The ULTIIMATE Caramel Sauce!!;I purchased a jar of this wonderful sauce when I was visiting family out-of-state. A stop at Trader Joe's is always on the agenda.
4;great chips;Pop Chips are the best chips I've had that are low calorie. The originals are my favorite but the Sea Salt and Vinegar are very very good also.
3;Tastes great at first.....then...;The first few bags were great. Now I get sick just looking at them.
5;Exciting Gift;This makes for an exciting gift for any child.  It opens the door for learning about the space program.
2;Too shroomy;I like the noodles themselves, and as has been written here before, they're relatively plentiful for this sort of product.  The killer for me is that the broth is fairly well pervaded with mushroom taste, which is a real turn-off, and IMHO anomalous for a product describe as miso-flavored.
5;Good flavor - beats Jeremiah Fogbuster;I typically order the cheapest bag of whole beans from Amazon that ship with Prime
3;Hard, crunchy and sweet;Considering the ingredients in this product, with the exception of sugar, it is a healthy combination.  I am a granola fan therefore was looking forward to trying something new.
5;Peanuts;The best peanuts I have ever purchased, tasted, or served.  Shipments are always fresh and the company offers several flavors.
1;Disapointed!;I bought this as its advertized as a Green Super Food!<br /><br />If it had as much greens as it claims, it would have ALLOT more Calcium in it, which it only has 30mg, which is only 4% of daily intake, and does not amount to anything.<br />The only vitamin that comes close to 100% is vitamin A.
5;With Shrimp....WOW;We first bought this olive oil at Sweet Dairy Farms store in southern GA.  It is wonderful with salads but we particularly love it with with shrimp.
5;gunpowder green tea;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;The best energy drink on the market;This is a great drink. The boost that you get is nice and clean with no sudden drop-off.
5;smooth;this coffee is a medium roast, smooth flavor that is great for brewed coffee, not too heavy or bold nor too light. not for espresso.
5;Perfect training treat!!;This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.
5;Good and good for you;Tastes great with hot milk.  Nutrition Action (Center for Science in the Public Interest - CSPI) gives it good marks for nutrition too.
5;Crunchy and Tasty;These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning.
5;these spice packs;really excellent. suggest watch 'you tube' videos on 'chinese street food' for many ideas on use for noodles/rice.
5;Fantastic blend;This is a great tea packed with caffeine and complex flavors. It even works well iced! It's a great example of how some black teas can be re-steeped as many as 6 times before losing their flavor.
5;Now BPA Free, According to Earth's Best;Here is the response I got to my emailed question about BPA in the lids of their glass jars:<br /><br />While all of our Earth's Best Foods were and are safe
5;The kitty bomb;One of my cats is diabetic so it's always difficult to find food that a) they'll both eat and b) doesn't have rice or potato in it. They LOVE these TikiCat foods! They're little Tiki addicts! The TikiCat has a line with rice that's very obviously noted on the labels which makes it very easy to avoid.
5;Fabulous stuff.. can't put it down!;I have a glass of crystal light with me all the time.  The berry flavors are the absolute best on the market.
2;Heavy on the cinnamon flavor;This creamer is very heavy on the cinnamon flavor and light on vanilla. I was very disappointed and now am stuck with 4 boxes of it.
5;Extremely Hot Stuff;
5;great service;Since we are on a very limited diet, I was looking for something to use and occassional treat for the kids that was organic, raw, and natural. This worked great! Fast shipping, great service, too.
5;The best yet!;I like Dunkin's coffee.  Since no coffee is totaly consistant I find this brew at home to be nearly as good as the best cup from Dunkin.
4;Good quality cookie;I had no idea that ladyfingers had become so rare except around the holidays.  In desperation to make a promised tiramisu, I bought some soft ones that are more like sponge cake than firm cookies.
4;Nice Taste, But ...;First of all, when I purchased this product it was listed as two 3-packs for the price.  I only received one 3-pack.
3;Good for the price...but.....;Tea smells fantastic, but there was not a great deal of taste.  No complaints at the price I paid, but if it had been full price, I would have been dissapointed.
5;can't go without it;My Dad introduced me to this product. I was having lots of headaches and digestive issues when he suggested I try this drink.
5;Great Product!!;I have two male cats and one of them recently had an UTI.<br />Vet prescripted other expensive brand food which requires the prescription for re-order.
5;Amazinggggg!;These things are the best for long nights of last minute homework! Its so nice not having to get an upset stomach after drinking a whole pot of coffee. Instead one little bottle and im good for hours! I think this is the best product out there for energy.
1;Disappointed;After reading the 1st review, I thought this hot sauce is hot according to this person.  I was looking for HOT, (hot in the true sense of the word)sauce,so I decided to try it.
5;Delicious candy;I used to get this candy at the dollar store but they quit carrying it.  I was pleased to find it here.
5;Good milk. Hefty price.;I love chocolate milk but was skeptical about how shelf stable milk would taste. I was pleased, the flavor is very good.
4;heartland  maltedmultigrain belgian wafflemix;This mix is very easy to use,just remember you have to wait 15 minutes before cooking. It is easy,as you just add water.
5;Gives Cafe Verona a run for the money!;I have been buying the Starbucks Cafe Verona K-cups at Costco since they came out.  I love them.
5;Time saver;Like most country folks, I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property, arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels, shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner.
5;One of my favorite cookies;A cookie a day (or 2, depending on serving size) is one of my few indulgences. I discovered the Country Choice line at my local Wegman's originally.
5;The Best Earl Grey Tea I've found;Stash 'double bergamot' Earl Grey tea absolutely is the best Earl Grey I've found, and I've tasted quite a few of them both here in the US, and while traveling in Europe.  The regular Earl Grey in this brand is also excellent, but the 'double bergamot' variety has a little more flavor than the Stash's regular Earl Grey.
5;STARBUCKS VIA COFFEE;Starbucks coffee via 50 count.  We love making a great cup of coffee one cup at a time.
2;"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery";"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive."
4;So glad to find prepared lentils;These are close to what I was looking for, but not quite.<br />When I lived in France, I used to buy prepared & seasoned lentils to eat on baguettes for a quick, cheap meal.
5;van houtte choclate rasberry k cups;I purchased a sample pack at christmas time and it was excellent.  This coffee is full of flavor and as a added bonus you can smell the rasberry while it is brewing.
5;Really top notch tasting, natural sweetness and just great;really delicious, much sweeter in taste (though no added sugar) than Vita Coco and O.N.
5;Delicious;These are a great edition to your cooking and flavoring collection.  Great for baking and making drinks.
5;Always great;My dogs just love this food. The service is always fast and reliable.
3;OK coffee but not the best by far;After receiving this coffee I made a few cups.  It was fairly smooth, not too overpowering, and had a slight mocha aroma.
5;my son loves it;he loves the flavor..
5;my absolute favorite sweetener;This is the best Agave on the market..
5;Delicious;"DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are ""heart healthy"" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself."
2;Would not reorder;I also ordered the black liquorice and absolutely loved it. But the mango didn't have that much flavor.
5;Great tea!;I purchased this tea because I am pregnant and red raspberry leaf supports uterine health. The tea tastes good (I sometimes use 2 tea bags for stronger flavor) and you can't beat the price on Amazon when compared to the grocery store.
3;Overly sweet;When I first drank this, I used one small package for an iceless mug. Unfortunately, without the ice it was too overpoweringly sweet.
4;Organic BPA Free Goodness! (I got Thailand sourced, noticing negative reviews from Sri Lanka cans as per other reviews);After reading the review about dented cans, I was leery to buy 2 cases from Amazon but I am glad I did! I received all 24 cans, and NONE were dented. I was pleasantly surprised! The milk worked for my thai curry quite well, but I just wish it was a bit thicker.
5;Best Sour Mix on the Market;Not only is this the best tasting sour mix on the market, it's also easy to store and has a long shelf life.  Whereas the liquid mix totally changes the flavor of your liquor, Bartenders Whiskey Sour Mix enhances the flavor with a slightly tangy sweet and sour taste.
5;Love this;I love this product.  As a cancer survivor I am constantly trying to find ways to keep my body strong and healthy.
5;Best deal ever!;This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.
2;It is spiced;Info provided doesn't disclose that this is spiced apple syrup.  I wish someone in the US would make just plain apple syrup.
2;Let Em Eat Cake !;Talk about overpriced !True, these bones are liked by bow-wows far and wide. However, dogs like serloin steaks much better.
5;No more inisulin;Our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet prescribed 5 units of insulin.
5;Another favorite chocolate wafer;A neat twist to the chocolate wafer by adding caramel to it. Next to KitKat, Twix is my favorite.
5;nice flavor;I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.
2;Bleech-in-a-box;That's right bleech, like you wanted to get it out of your mouth as fast as possible:<br /><br />I do not like green eggs and spam<br />I do not like it sam-i-am<br />I'd rather eat my athletic sox<br />Than eat this Picnic-in-a box<br /><br />Now:<br /><br />Salmon, not bad if your starving on a desert island  1 star<br /><br />Edamame, bad no matter where you eat it especially if your not near a water source  0 star<br /><br />Crackers, good but how can you ruin crackers  4 star<br /><br />Chocolate, actually pretty good (but you have to like hard, i mean hard chocolate) 4 star<br /><br />Fruit&Nut Mix was the best of the bunch, truly enjoyable  5 star<br /><br />So:<br /><br />Why two overall, I'm being nice.  Since the main part of the meal was the salmon and the edamame how else would you rate it.
5;My cat loves these!!!;My cat goes craaaazy over these treats!  Every time I shake the plastic container I put them in or open the lid she comes running and meowing.  She loves them so much I've been able to teach her tricks using these.
5;Makes a great cup of coffee;If you like a balanced cup of joe, this is a great choice. The coffee is smooth and balanced.
3;Heidi likes it?;I don't know if I'm going to be able to give this product it's full test.  I love the idea of it, and I don't mind the smell at first.
4;wonderful treat but doesn't last as long as other rawhide;My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.
5;Good Tea;A nice big box so you don't have to worry about running out of tea anytime soon.  Flavorful, but mild for anytime of day.
5;perfect;Keeps K cups neat and shows everyone the variety. No sifting through boxes to decide what you want.
2;Amazon keeps on sending me the wrong item;Be cautioned when ordering this product.<br /><br />What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version.
5;Great Food;I used to feed my GSD this and she loved it!!  Unfortunately my maltese turns his nose up at it and every other can food I have given him.  I tried explaining to him this stuff is $3 per can but silly dog only wants dry dog food.
5;Excellent Tea, Good Price;I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle.
3;Weak flavor;This brand makes a decent cup of coffee ..
5;I love this flavor!;Kettle chips are a high quality product. The chips are thicker than regular chips, and you can always tell that the individual ingredients being used are of really good quality.
5;So good, I will have to stop ordering them.;I love these cookies.  One of those products that taste so good, even gluten-eaters love them.
5;Lol all of the Expiration 1 Star reviews are wrong.;Lol you guys that say it expires fast are wrong. It aaa on tue bottle that the date format is the european one.
4;Buffalo Bills Sweet n' Spicy Jerky;has a very pleasant flavor, but did find this to be very tough. Had to cut into pieces to chew.
5;YUM!;I have found that ZICO has the most consistently great tasting coconut water out there! Other companies can have good batches and not so good batches. ZICO has never let me down.
5;I am a big fan;I love sesame oil, and this is exactly the sort of heavy, dark, unrefined sesame oil that, hm, rocks my world. And this is a great deal, good product, good price.
1;BIG HUGE RIP OFF - - -;I paid $7.70 for ONE box.
2;No Match for Homemade or Kraft;Very easy to overcook the pasta and the cheese sauce mix is yucky.<br /><br />This product is no match for the macaroni and cheese I grew up with or the product from Kraft.
5;best unsalted low-fat chips;I really enjoy the Guiltless Gourmet unsalted baked tortilla chips.  It is so difficult to find products that are both low-salt and low-fat.
4;No Soy!  (except in the peppermint gum);Our main reason for experimenting with Glee Gum is that it seems to be the only gum on the market that is soy-free.  With soy allergies at an all-time high, and a major allergen in our own family, this gum is a welcome discovery.
5;awesome;Best one yet.If you have not tried this one yet your missing out very tender and moist nuggets.
3;Good, except they were melted;These gummies would have been very good except for the fact that over half the box was melted by the time they got to me. I don't know if they sat on a hot tarmac in Dallas, or if they were melted before they left the store.
5;Tasty, Nutritious, & Convenient;I get a pack of 6 items every month.  I love the taste.
1;EXPIRED Product;I love this product. I use steamed milk instead of water, and it is just like the $5 venti mocha at the store.
5;Nice kick;I have tried a few of the items. Pav bhajji was especially nice as it is had just enough hot spice to make it interesting without being too hot.
5;No Beans About It;Excellent product.[ASIN:B000CPZSC8 Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 1/2 lb.
5;My fussy eater loves this;My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.
3;Gross;Honestly, I'm sure the tea works, don't really know. I have bronchiectasis and chronic asthma, yes.
5;I even love this fruitcake;I had the fortune of marrying a guy that loves fruitcake. After so many years of fruitcake jokes in my family, it was an adjustment to think someone actually wants one of these things.
4;"A little too ""rough"" for me sometimes";I know these aren't typical graham crackers. They are more like oatmeal/graham crackers which makes the texture different.
5;delicious and calming;The tea is one of the best mass market teas I've purchased - most mass brand teas taste bland or overly flavored (processed).  This camomile tea tastes smooth and rich
5;My expensive Keurig just croaked!;My expensive Keurig just croaked!  I can't decide whether to buy a new one or not.  So this looked like a great alternative until I could figure out a plan of action.
3;Not bad, not great either.;I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down.  This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.
5;Great salsas that are a bit eclectic;First of all, at $4 per bottle the value is obvious.  Secondly, these salsas are very good quality.
1;Tomato-oregano Croccantini;This is my least favorite of the croccantini's
3;No Fear,Super Energy Supplement;In comparison to other products (and pure generic 'yellow' caffeine pills), the No Fear Energy drink offers no better buzz.<br /><br />Every energy formula on the market produces a different energizing feeling, some are clean and high grade, while others like this one seem full of hype without a super energetic effect.
4;Coffee value  for the price;We have been using this brand for a year or there about,  always on time, fresh, same distinct flavor, nice price  in comparison, for the Price really  one of the best  outstanding values .<br /><br />Highly recommended.
5;Double-spice is Double nice!;This tea is delightfully spiced!  I brew it strong
5;My, this is popular with the cats!;"""Uh oh,"" I thought when I saw ""Product of Thailand"" on the box, with the recent contaminated Chinese wheat gluten scandal reverberating in my memory, however unfairly. (I'm wary of food imports from Third World countries in general now."
4;Basically a laxative...;I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best.
5;You MUST try this candy!;This candy is almost exclusively sold in movie theaters - I have no idea why.  I can't even find it in any of my local theaters any more.
5;Great flavor;Wow, the olive flavor socked me from the first bite. GREAT flavor.
5;Lovely;Hands down, the best flavored creamed honey I've ever had.  It has the most wonderful aroma, and I'm really impressed with its consistency.
5;No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas;My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild.
5;Great Product and Great Price;My two Labrador Retrievers love these bones and they are thick enough to where they really need to work at them to soften and chew them.  This is a great product at a great price.
5;Favorite mint chocolate bar;I've had quite a few mint chocolate candies in my life, and this is definitely my favorite.  Not only is the bar 70% chocolate, but it's not where it's a case of chocolate surrounding an overpoweringly sweet and minty center like the Ghirardelli ones.
5;Great taste, good quality;I have never tried hemp seeds before, and this was a good start! It tastes great on my oatmeal and just by itself. Great snack, but make sure you keep it in the fridge after opening.
5;Quick and delicious!;I hesitated buying this product because it's a bit on the pricey side, but I do enjoy brown rice and it's such a pain to cook.  I was impressed by the glowing reviews of this product, and finally decided to take a chance.
3;OK Tea, not bad;I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands.
5;Works great!;Been using this product for a few months now and have been very happy with it.  It stores easily in my gym bag in single-serving foil pixie sticks.
5;The best!;Amy's Kitchen makes great vegetarian, organic meals that convince you it isn't healthy at all.  This soup beats any cream of tomato soup out there.
4;good product;Good product but my daughter did not like the Grahams Cinnamon.  Nice addition to a lunch box.
5;Excellent with Salmon;Excellent with Salmon.  Just add some olive oil and coat with the rub and cook as desired.
5;This is so Yummy!;I love this cereal.  I have a gluten sensitivity, and this has been a great alternative to standard breakfast cereal.
5;MIO sweet tea 4 pack;Very happy with this purchase. Everytime I try to buy it in the store, it's always sold otu, Especially the Sweet Tea flavor.
3;Dad's favorite;The Emeril's decaf is my husbands favorite of all the decaf's we have tried so far. For me, it tastes a little burned and reminds me of Starbucks.
3;Good, Not Great.;I was really excited about getting this tea. I have been attempting to eliminate bad foods and drinks from my diet so I thought this would be a good way to curb my chocolate cravings.
5;Great!;I regularly use coriander when cooking and brewing beer. These bulk bags are great! This is more than you'll need, but significantly cheaper than any other option I've found.
5;quality product;this is very high quality rice,you may be put off by the price, but its justified by quality.<br />we all know you can buy a 10LB sack of rice for about 1.
5;Coco for Coconut Oil;We use this for cooking. A friend told me to use on my face as a night moisturizer & what a difference my skin now has in my morning after I wake.
1;"Honeyville whole powdered eggs are ""TASTELESS""!";"I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me ""yummy/flavorfull"" egg sandwiches (i."
5;My Dog;Our dog just loves this food. It is very good for her and the best thing of all NOT MUCH WASTE to pick up.
5;Delicious;My wife and I are coffee drinkers. We love the stuff.
5;Sen-Sen  Wonderful Memories;This was such a wonderful find and it's just like the Sen Sen my mother used to dig out of her purse when I was small.  The only thing I miss is the little slide box that it came in.
5;My dog loves these!;My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.
5;Nature's best.;Hands down, the best cereal ever conceived by mankind. If Chocolate is the food of the gods then surely these Berries are the breakfast of the gods.
4;Great find;I know they had discontinued this item, but every time I would go to the supermarket my bf would look for this, because he lovvvves this stuff. So i did some homework and was glad to find this! Now my bf can rest easy because he has his Reese's peanut butter.
5;Best tea there is, love the jasmin;I see two reviews saying this is made in Thailand.  I would like to know why people think this since it only says Hawaii on the bottles.
5;Best I have ever eaten;This product is excellant. Priced the same as Whole Foods.
5;MTmom;This is a great spaghetti mix!  Hard to find in our remote area so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com and have it delivered to my door.
5;Best Cat Food for Quality & Value;Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul is the best you can get--considering the price.  My cats (5) love it and are very healthy since I've started feeding them this food.
5;Yummy Truffles;Oh My God!!!  What more is there to say.  Between the texture and the wonderful taste I must say it is the best chocolate I have ever eaten and I am a chocolate addict.
3;Too sweet;Assuming you get these from a good seller(which most people on here didn't seem to get, so be careful about where you get them!), these are far too sweet! They are a decent chocolate, similar to Cadbury milk chocolate bars you can get in the US, but they have an interesting flaky texture. I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them.
4;wonderful hot cocoa;This is a good hot cocoa.  It is really good for someone who is looking for all the taste of hot cocoa but wants to limit their caffeine intake, it is 99% caffeine free.
5;Really Good Tea;This tea is everything it says it is.  Works great and has a great taste.
5;BEST TASTING;the people that say this taste nasty have no idea what they are talking about. this product is amazing and taste really well with milk or milk based drinks.
5;Great taste and value;I bought the three pack of big cans for a great price. It's good tasting stuff and a far better value than Starbucks Via.
4;Smell bad, but dogs don't mind;This is a great product.  My dogs love chewing them and they last for a long time.
5;needed more;I had bought some of this locally and liked it so much that i had to lookk for a better price.  I have found the better price here on amazon.
1;a distant second;"this is nowhere near the quality and taste of Splenda's french vanilla ""flavors for coffee"". <a href=""http://www."
1;Bait & Switch;**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors
5;Edible Silver Leaf for Cakes/Candies;Great product at a good price.  It used to be possible to buy edible silver and gold leaf (vark) at Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays importing it.
5;Yummy!;I had to make cornbread for my son's cubscouts banquet and we are now gluten free. I am not fond of cornbread usually but my son LOVES it.
1;Always rated at the very bottom of unbiased reviews.;Please do some research yourself to find out that they are ALWAYS rated the worst food for your pet in unbiased reviews.<br /><br />The top ingredients for this product are crude meal and loads of grains.
5;My go-to coffee subsitute;Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure, which is why I drink it.  I've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute, though one must acquire a taste for it.
1;new formula;I have been a loyal Cytomax user for 12 years now. Bring back the old formula.
5;comfort food!;I grew up in Europe, and missed having hazelnut products after moving to the USA. Whenever I bake with hazelnuts, it makes the perfect comfort foods! Hazelnut cookies, hazelnut cake with mocha butter icing and dark chocolate.
5;Clear Jel for all your home canned pie fillings;I tried this for the first time after hearing recommendations from other folks who like to can.  This really made my canned apple pie fillings look wonderful.
5;Surprised at negative reviews -- I love this one!;I think this is a fantastic coffee. Subtle chocolate flavor but not cloying.
5;Tasty Snack;I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste.
5;The best rice you can buy!;This rice is the most delicious we have ever tasted.  We were introduced to it by my daughter who used to buy it directly from the farmer when she lived in New Orleans.
5;Great taste!;This tastes great. I can't say too much about the energy factor, although I should point out that energy drinks don't usually do much for me.
4;Delicious;I bought these for my 5 year old, but I think I like them more than he does!  These are a great healthy sweet snack that's not too sweet.  For me, it curbs my craving without feeling like I've just taken in a bunch of unhealthy fillers and chemicals.
5;VERY GOOD TASTING!!!;this brand of tamales is by far the best tasing that we have tryed.supberb taste,not greasy,very filling,we had these over rice,it was a good fast meal.
2;Weird taste!!;This does NOT taste like soy milk. I've tried different labels of soy milk, and this one probably contains the least soy in it.
4;snack bar with protein!!;the KIND PLUS almond/walnut/macadamia + protein bar is the best snack bar i have ever tried..
5;Nice, Big Pieces & Big Almond Flavor;These were shipped out the day after I ordered them and arrived within 5 days.  (I live on the opposite coast where these are made.
4;Dogs love it... just not mine;My dog is a finicky eater so I wasn't really expecting him to eat this..
2;Where's the chicken?;My dogs enjoy these treats (which is why they get two stars instead of one) but I'm really disappointed in them. There is very little chicken on them, significantly less than in the product picture.
4;It's pricey, but our picky cats like it.;Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled.
5;Awesome drink!!!;Helps with hunger. I drink it instead of snacking and it works.
4;Some flavors OK , some questionable;Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact.
5;My Dog Loves Them;I use these to give my dogs nasty tasting pills.  It works like a charm.
5;Healthy AND tasty;I originally got these because I thought I wouldn't want to eat as many while trying to lose weight.  I have come to love these unsalted pretzels.
5;TASTE-E!;If you like truffles, you owe it to yourself to try this out!  The first time I used it, I used too much, the salt is really salty & the truffles are real- well, you get the idea.  Only a pinch at a time turns scrambled eggs into a fancy treat!  Bought some several months ago and I'm back buying some for a friend who is a very good cook.
1;NOT AS PICTURED!;"When I ordered, the photo of the can clearly stated ""e.."
5;Pricey, But Delicious;These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.
5;I Felt Like A Thief When I Bought These!;"What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6"" long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store."
1;I ordered this and waited and waited;and then got a refund saying the company does not carry this item any longer..
5;Must try!;Wonderful flavor and truly versatile. This is a must have in your fridge all the time! Also makes a great gift.
5;Greenies Cat Treats;My cats absolutely LOVE this product, and it is safe and healthy for them.  It is crunchy, helping to clean their teeth, and it contains chlorophyll, a nutrient essential in their natural diet.
5;Jalapeno Potato Popchips, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12);I love these things.  Makes me feel better not eating preservatives.
5;Reliable, quality, no after taste, for every single cup;I had a Flavia machine for two years.  Ran into the the Senseo in Germany during a business trip.
4;Tastes as expected....;I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got this, but I was pleasantly surprised. I made some taco salads and these worked great.
5;My cat goes crazy for them;I don't like to feed junk to my cat so these come in handy when it's time for a treat. The subscribe and save price make them more affordable.
5;Yummy Caramel Pecan Turtles;Delicious!  Came on time.  Packaged exceptionally well.
4;Very good GF PT cookies;This GF PT cookies are good. Very taste and good.
5;WAY better than the local GF Bakery;While you can't make bread like it looks on the cover, you can make simply awesome bread with this mix.  You don't even have to toast it, or slather it with butter or other toppings.
5;GREAT STUFF;Hey everyone this is GREAT STUFF.<br />Simple and easy to make.
5;My Favorite;I love this coffee.  As I get older, my stomach can't seem to take the really strong blends.
4;great flavor, stupid price;These are great almonds, but in February a box was $40. Now in July they are $65!! Gas did not go that high.
5;Hidden Springs Maple syrup;This is one of the very finest maple syrups I have ordered and enjoyed. I bought the Fancy Grade, for the light amber color.
5;Dust from heaven.;I first came across the seasoning mixture known as Scichimi Togarashi where it was used as a condiment at a Japanese fast food chain in Southern California.<br /><br />It manages through a wonderful synergy of ingredients to be a flavor enhancing medium of addictive power.
5;Great flour;This flour works for most baking projects. I have had great luck though my bread still is not like regular bread it is getting better.
5;Great Product!;This is a very good natural product for helping with bloating, irregularity, and constipation.  It tastes great and works.

5;Fresh and tasty;Great taste and very fresh.  We order and buy cashews often and sometimes run into stale cashews.
5;Lavazza is a great choice;After purchasing a Gaggia Titanium I was looking for a great tasting espresso, I found other people's reviews helpful and decided to try Lavazza Super Crema - it is wonderful!  It produces a thick crema and does not have a bitter taste like so many other espresso beans. Each cup reminds me of the great tasting quality coffee one gets in European coffee shops.
5;"Don't be fooled by the Sams Club ""fruit"" snacks";OK so I bought the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks thinking I could save some money.  Come on they are 5 and 2 they'll eat anything with sugar, right?  WRONG.
4;Good coffee;I usually drink decaf, for health reasons.  I found this coffee to have a robust flavor without being bitter.
3;Like Battery Acid;(This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal.
5;Great taste !!;I got this sauce for a friend of mine who's an expert in Tai food.<br /><br />She cooked a Pad Thai using this and it was delicious!  Previous sauces she used had a big issue: too spicy.
5;Can't live without it;Life is good when you start the day with a relaxing cup of Mystic Chai. I love the smooth taste, the spices are just right.
4;Good tasting and frees up space in my fridge and pantry;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:10 Mins<br /><br /></span>Using <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;nice;The Keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer.  The drawer opens and closes with ease.
5;Great flavor, Ketchup Chips;First time trying Herr's brand Ketchup potato chips, really love them. Its just as good as other brand catsup chips that I've tried in Canada.
2;VERY stinky but my dogs LOVED it;This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around.
5;These are the best!;I love these bars and run out of them quickly. I don't feel guilty about this snack - they are tasty yet healthy.
1;Very Disappointed;I ordered quite a large order from Barry Farms which included the dough enhancer. Their website said that orders would be filled and shipped usually in 48 hours.
2;Good on the pinch, Strange on the taste buds;This cornbread mix is very easy to make (just add water) and i can appreciate that. Flavor is mild corn, kinda gritty texture, and has a strange aftertaste.
5;My twins love it!;My twins recently got a little picky on the baby food..
5;Better than wheat!;This is really a great product.  I made pancakes and for the first time, my pancakes turned out fluffly and really tasted good.

5;"A TASTE OF ""N'AW'INS"" GREAT SPICE MIX FOR MANY DISHES!";I have been using this spice mix for many years but, I have found it hard to find lately. I decided I would check Amazon and I was very surprised to see it available! I am a fairly good cook and I have developed some easy dishes using this mix and it is very unusual and tasty! A 12 pack is a lot of this spice but, it does keep for years and I use it quite often.
5;Discover  true  happiness  on  Amazon's  Grocery  Shelf ?;A food - successful since 1933 - BAY's English Muffins are now on amazon.com's grocery shelf.
5;Excellent taste!  Good for heartburn!;Highly recommend this product. Wouldn't you rather chew on a tasty bit of sweetened orange rind then a chalky pill?  I also coat these in dark chocolate for holiday treats.
5;My Kitty Seems To Love It;I don't know how I could say whether or not the cat food is tasty, but my kitty seems to like it.  My vet recommends this particular brand of food, so that's good enough for me.
5;Great Raspberry Taste ~ Sugar Free;This product rocks! If you are looking for a pure crisp clean raspberry taste this is it!<br />The product is sugar free but doesn't have an aftertaste or artificial taste. I found this product after asking a big name chain restaurant server how they made their yummy ice tea.
4;Smooth taste;Coffee has very smooth taste.  I had to do some research as to how to use the pods.
5;Perfectly flaky, great flavor;Every year I order some smoked salmon for my dad, and this has been, by far, the best yet. Not at all dry like some we have gotten.
5;OHHHH MYYYYY GOODNESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!;TIMOTHY'S GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE K-CUP IS NOW MY #1 FLAVOR, I HAVE MY BEST FRIEND HOOK TO THIS FLAVOR AS WELL.  YOU CAN TASTE FROM THE CHOCOLATE TO THE COCONUT, YUMMY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TIMOTHY'S.
3;Easy and good;It is Not as good as other packages or scratch and I like the cinnamon flavor better then the blueberry.  That being said, not bad makes 6 normal size muffins.
5;Protein Snack;When my health care provider asked me to eat concentrated amounts of protein as between meal snacks,  what could I choose?  That was my dilemma.<br /><br />When looking for snacks I needed something that was easy to carry around with me and rather low in carbohydrates.
2;two sets of the same princesses ...;I just got my set of 6 princess pez for my daughter as an incentive for potty training.  We were excited to get them, but opened the package to find: 1 Tiana pez, 1 Cinderella pez, 2 Belle pez, and 2 Ariel pez.
2;Bought this after a friend recommended it;But..
5;Really tasty;I'd seen an add for these in a magazine recently, but my local grocery store hasn't had them in stock, so I was really glad to get the chance to try the Appletini flavor out.  It's delicious!  While it certainly doesn't taste like the real thing, it's got a nice, light flavor that is different from all the other powdered drink mixes out there.
1;Go back to the old formula;This cereal used to be good AND have almost no sugar at all. Now the formula has changed and it looks and tastes horrible.
1;worst customer service!;You only know the soul of a company (or a person for that matter) when something goes WRONG. Well there was a mix up on my order.
5;Absolutely delicious and nutritious, a welcome addition to an overall healthy diet;As someone who tries to be healthy as far as food is concerned, eating whole grains has been the cornerstone of this endeavor. Along with exercise, trying my very best to eat a healthy diet has reaped rewards as far as my weight overrall health profile is concerned.
5;Highly addictive! Great with beer;I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer.
5;AWESOME!;I have tasted a few flavors and so far this is the best! I absolutely love it! So much so that I buy it buy the case now. I don't think it makes you jittery
5;Awesome sweetness;I love love this product. A friend recommended this brand to me through a food thread on a recipe website.
5;Yummy tummy;Veri Peri products are a delight to have outside of South Africa.  I haven't had a sauce that tastes like the real thing until I tasted this one.
5;THE REAL DEAL;Im not sure about the other products out there but this stuff will make you believe your at the theater..
5;awesome alternative to standard peanut butter cups;When I opened the package I thought I'd just try a couple of the cookies to see what they were like.  Instead, they were so tasty that I ended up eating half the package in one sitting.
5;YES! YES! YES!;MY CATS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS STUFF. I HAVE TWO 4 YEAR OLDS AND TWO 8 YEAR OLDS AND THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH.
5;Great for dogs with stomach problems;My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.
1;AWFUL -  WATERY - NO REFUND ALLOWED;I bought a box of 36 Fog Chaser and a box of 36  Decaf.  Both are so weak, too weak even for people that like weak coffee.
5;Scrumptious! Well Tolerated by People with J-Pouches;These chips are unlike any other similar ones that we've ever tried. For starters, they are generously seasoned and taste great! There's no hunting around in the bag for the seasoned ones because every chip in the bag tastes great.
1;This product can cause digestive problems.;This product caused my dog to have bad indigestion problems. He was sick for two days.
5;Monkey Platter!;This tray makes a perfect monkey platter for a toddler! Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized.
5;She loves it;I can understand this might not be for every dog
5;Great Pasta!;First we tried Tinkyada rice pasta and we could eat it but it was mushy and soft. This brand tastes better too and holds up just like wheat pasta if you don't evercook it.
4;great tasting bar;This a great energy bar.  The bar has a great chocolate/peanut butter taste, but it's not too sweet.
5;Potassium Explosion!  Cholesteral Marvel!;I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.
5;fortune cookie;The cookie arrived on time and was in excellent condition.  It was also delicious.
4;The best Decaf coffee by far;Not bitter but strong, best decaf ever by far. Can't compare to lavazza, which I think is overrated and terrible.
5;what a little wonder this is!!!;this is a very awesome product good for the money, was shipped well before time and packed greatly with care!!! let me tell you some great quailities for one i had an aweful sinus infection that wolud not go away my ears popped every time i swallowed and headaches..
5;strong taste no bite;This oil is worth the expense.I am using it for all the uncooked applications: topping on bread, salad dressing , raw sauces .
5;Amazing;Another amazing flavor from this company. Unlike their other bars there is no coconut undertones, and it is also surprisingly sticky.
5;Delicious!!!;I currently subscribe to the Hodgson caraway Rye which I absolutely love, but thought I would try the barley. I could not wait for it to cool out of the bread maker and tried a slice.
5;Love it!;I have difficulty finding Owl 3-in-1 products where I live so being able to order from Amazon has been wonderful.  The coffee is absolutely delicious and has become my new favorite 3-in-1.
5;nestle hot cocoa mix;THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS.I LOVE COCOA AND THE ABSENCE OF CAFFINE ENABLES ME TO ENJOY IT AGAIN.
5;Tasty Popcorn Chips;If you like white cheddar popcorn, you may love this transformation of it into an easy to eat chip that is low in fat and sodium. Only 130 calories per serving, it's a great snack for parties and healthier than potato chips.
3;BEWARE!!! Amazon doesn't list expiration dates.;Was soooooo excited to receive my Maypo! That came to a crashing halt when I opened the Amazon box to expose the factory sealed case inside.The case expires in 2 months.
2;Dissapointed;When I saw sugar free bridge mix I was so happy. Havn't had in a long time being a diabetic.
5;Great for training;Reasonably priced, healthy & all natural, low-calorie. They're small and easy to chew, so they are great for training sessions.
2;Subtle Smoke;I purchased this product because I love the flavor of smoked foods and good mustard.The name.
5;great coffee;This is a great coffee for a great price. I love kcups because the brew is always perfect, and jet fuel is a very bold brew to get me going.
4;better than most freeze dried instant coffee I've tried;The package size is small, and I use it to add 1/3rd teaspoon to my brewed cup of Senseo Kona blend to darken and intensify it. I haven't tried the Starbucks instants, but this product is better than any others I've tried and unique in flavor and aroma.
3;seam open;The flavor is pretty good. I am pretty bummed because my tea bags aren't sealed all the way.
5;Great Product;Great product. I use it to supplement my Quaker Oats breakfast.
3;Black Cherry Tea;This was a big disappointment to me.  I truly adore the Strawberry Tea and the Peach Tea from St.
5;The BEST popcorn I think I've ever had!;Ok- I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy 12 lbs of popcorn. We just like to eat it a few times a week.
5;Awesome product;Best tasting, best mixing, real results. I have tried several protein products that do not compare to the Labrada brand in taste.
5;Numi assortment in time for the holidays;Last year for Christmas I sent Numi tea in the wooden box to friends and family and I love that there is a new packaging option this year.  Numi is a brand that I am always proud to bring to the table after dinner.
2;Too much BBQ for me;"I wasn't a fan of this ""variety"" pack. Only 1 or 2 bags of my favorites, and over 10 bags of BBQ."
5;Dogs, Cats, Ferrets all love this;I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain.
2;very runny;My 9 month old daughter loves all of the Earth's Best 2nd and 3rd stage foods.  I realize the 2nd stages are still a pretty thin consistency which is fine, but this particular flavor is REALLY runny.
5;"The BEST ""mango in a container"" product ever!";Item arrived quickly and frozen on dry ice.  After sampling a thawed container, I have to say this is the best canned mango product I've tried.
4;Not Extra Bold;Definitely not extra bold..
5;Best Kernel Seasons Flavor;This is the absolute best of the Kernel Seasons popcorn flavors. I have tried probably 10 or 12 flavors and this one is just about perfect if you like something sweet on your popcorn.
5;Wonderful!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Amazing!!!!;At first after looking at some of the reviews on these noodles I was very worried that I would be disappointed, but after just having tasted this amazing product I am completely overjoyed! As an Italian girl who loves her pasta, giving it up to lose some weight on the hcg was very discouraging. After trying these today I am SO excited!<br /><br />To all those out there who are cautious and wondering if these things are really worth it, they are! It depends on how you prepare them.
5;Handy;I usually rotate between several brands of moist dog food to keep breakfast interesting for our JRT.  This product is wonderful to have on hand and our dog loves it.
5;I have never seen her dance for treats;I was skeptical, little Ms. Pepper can be finicky.
3;Tasted Okay;It is very much like white rice that is why the fiber content is very low.  This rice would be great for someone to ease in to eating real brown rice.
5;Favorite of Muli Cat Household;I have three cats and with Newman's Own chicken and rice I have finally found a brand and flavor that all three love.  Granted it has a foul smell, but then.
5;Tastes great, healthy too;I'm pleased to see this oatmeal available on amazon since I can't find it anymore in my grocery store. It tastes great, and I have never been an oatmeal person.
5;Pero, Inka, Cafix review...;I bought a case of all three products, Inka, Pero and Cafix in order to compare them. Honestly? They are all the same, so go with whatever is the cheapest.
5;You won't be sorry...;This product does exactly what it says it will for you. It especially helped with my anxiousness and body tension.
5;Refreshingly Balanced Black Mint Tea +++;This is a refreshingly balanced black mint tea that can easily be made much like a usual black tea -- with a usual amount of organic sugar or honey and a usual amount of milk -- as I just did, with an excellent batch of hot black mint tea resulting. So, likely any kind of milk will work well with this rich tea.
4;My Dog Loves This Food;I have a 12 year old golden retriever.  I have been feeding him Happy Hips treats for almost a year hoping the glucosamine helps with his arthritis.
1;These are QUICK GRITS.;I did read the disclaimer, but was still a bit surprised when the package arrived.  The boxes of grits were nothing like the description.
5;Healthy snack;They aren't kidding when they named these  Buffalo Bills Ole Smokies Big Venison - these sticks are big in size and taste. The venison taste is good - moist and full of flavor.
5;Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee;I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with.
5;Totally impressed;I was thrilled this product was available.  Delivery was timly and product arrived perfectly.
4;complete but broken;box arrived on schedule, the only compliant would be the number of broken crackers spread thrughout the packaage. There could be a better system.
5;Candy- YUMMMMMMM;My favorite candy, I loved it!  Mr. Goodbar is a wonderful candy bar, and Hershey's does a wonderful job with it.
5;Great with Egg Salad;These corn thins are great with egg salad spread on them.  Can't use all of them by expiration date? - Put the packages in the freezer.
4;A pleasant surprise;As a single, middle-aged man who never really learned to cook, I'm always keeping my eye out for good frozen entrees.  This chicken curry, which I happened across in the local Ingles grocery store, was surprisingly tasty.
5;What's Your Fortune Say?;For older kids, even high school, this would be a great starter story for them to read and then make their own fortune cookies, inserting their own fortunes before the hot smooth cookies harden. A nice end note explains some of the original of the Fortune cookie as Japanese, not Chinese, but the overall charm of the book is its celebration of the traditions of the messages inside the cookies.
4;Yummy, but small...;This brand of granola bars are really good.  The very berry are my favorite.
5;Will buy no other;"My 22 lb Frengle (half Beagle, half French Bulldog) will devour almost anything rawhide or ""gummy"" like the other nylabones.  This one is perfect."
2;wrong size;I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs.  My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.
5;Spicy and delicious;I love jerky.<br />When it comes to fresh organic jerky nothing beats Ed's Roadhouse.
1;Tasteless, dry and just gross;My title pretty much says it all. I was very disappointed.
5;Great Price;I had been buying this product elsewhere until I found it on Amazon for a much better price. It is a very easy way to get your children to take their vitamins, as they taste great and are soft versus chewy.
3;It's better than average for a Velveeta/HH type meal, though it seems pricey;I used to have Hamburger Helper (HH) as a kid.  But when I became an adult, I bypassed the HH for something cheaper, making cheese sauce myself.
4;MMMMMMM Good;I found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack. I have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just don't taste that good.
4;DisposaCups;I recently received a Kuerig Coffee Maker  and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product. DisposaCups came to the resue.
5;Hard to Find Item;I have been looking for Instant Clear Jel for about a year. I finally found it at Berry Farms.
1;In edible;May be great for you, but as it didn't mix into anything, much too difficult to actually ingest it. It sat like sand in the bottom of the glass.
5;Great dog food;Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.
5;Best Cookie in the World;This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself.
3;little too much;This coffee is pretty stout. I was trying to stay away from the starbucks beans because they are too dark roasted for my liking.
5;Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend;A smooth light roast for your morning coffee break. This is my favorite blend, not too strong with excellent flavor.
5;My Cats Love It;My three cats took a vote this morning, and they give this three paws up!  It kind of reminds me of Fancy Feast, but it's healthier -- no wheat gluten, dyes, or preservatives.  I have one cat with a delicate stomach, and Fancy Feast sometimes makes her throw up, but she can eat this with no problems at all.
5;Mmmmm good!;Just had some Greenoodles with Tom Yum Soup for dinner tonight and I'm glad I did. Fast easy and delicious.
5;One to get.;Just got the Masia Extra Virgin Olive Oil, amazing taste!! Recommend it to all good tasters out there. This one is a must.
5;Love this tea!;I first bought this tea from a clearance rack at my local grocery store.  Then I couldn't find it again.
5;Great product;Double concentrated tomato paste is great addition to cooking. Highly recommended for pasta sauces, stews, soups or just plain on the sandwiches.
5;They Loved it;This was sent as a gift.  More than once I was told how happily they munched on these.
5;Very high quality;We have been using this brand of maple syrup for over 6 years.  The B grade has more minerals than A grade.
2;a bit surprised;after the enthusiastic writeup, imagine my surprise when I found the oil to be a bit rancid. One could see good oil below it, but for all the claims about freshness it wasn't.
4;Yummy Jelly Beans;Beans arrived in a plastic bag instead of plastic container, no big deal.<br /><br />Same quality as the ones in the grocery store.
1;"Not a ""Chew"", its more like a Jaw-breaker!";"I like Dogswell products and have purchased the ""Vitality"" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard."
4;Great product;I rate this 4 stars only because the chocolate flavor isn't as flavorful as it could be.  The chocolate could be more distinct.
5;great tasting capuccino;this capuccino is very smooth and tastes great.  use the lower water amount for a richer, fuller flavor  but i like it with 10 ounces of hot water.
3;Limey;I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.
5;Yummy;I'm not a huge coffee fan but I do love both vanilla and most Starbucks products.  This coffee smells fantastic while brewing and tastes delicious especially with a vanilla (or cinnamon!) flavored creamer.
5;FANTASTIC!!!!!!;GREAT SNACK, I DON'T FEEL GUILTY HAVING A SNACK. I AM ON A LOW SODIUM DIET, DR.
5;Great Product;Delicious, with plenty of nuts, seeds, and dried fruits.  Buying in bulk from Amazon saves me about 45% over buying from local grocery.
3;Okay taste;It's my first time buying yakisoba noodles. The box itself is very nice looking and well wrapped, but inside is sort of disappointing because you might start wonder why they use such a box to store little stuff.
5;Great Tea;Great Tea, arrived on time, and in air tight tea package to preserve flavor. Also mixes well with other tea.
5;Real Puffed Rice!;I have no idea why you can't find Quaker Puffed Rice in the U.S.
5;Not Herr's;Hi,<br />Same as Firefly, the received chips were not Herr's, they were Michael Season's Natural Gourmet sea salt & balsamic vinegar.  They are delicious, always have loved the doubled folded over chips, there were many in the bag!  Would definitely order again.
4;Definitely tastes different from Coke;I purchased mine at Target, but the cost there is comparable to Amazon's pricing. This definitely does NOT taste like Coke.
5;Love Pill Pockets;I have been using these for a long time.  This was a great deal.
1;Warning:  Formula Change;Well, rats.  I finally found a renal cat food that my cat likes, and they change the formula!!  To defend her pickiness, Sabrina has had renal disease for 6.
4;"Always an excellent and delicious cereal, if a little ""crush""-y";I love Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and somehow I doubt that people decide to purchase a particular cereal based on customer reviews on a website, so I'll spare you all my warm feelings about how tasty the cereal is.  But believe me, it is AWESOME.
5;Great product;The best sauce on the market.  We use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
5;Taste the original of Inca Kola;I love this soda!!!! Have you ever been to Peru? Well if you have you'll know about Inca Kola. Tried it and you won't be disappointed.
5;It's about time!;I am SO thankful that Amora is available through the web..
5;Good beef sticks;Nice variety of jerky..
2;Not as advertised!;"The item shipped looks nothing like the 'Mleveni Plazma' box in the photo, its a something called ""Lane."" It might be the same thing, but its totally different packaging with no explanation."
4;Pretty good, light OO;This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.
5;This product has really helped me!;I use this every night to help with sleep and restless legs. It also helps if I feel an anxiety attack (panic attack) coming.
4;Pretty good if you like the flavor.;Vitamin Squeeze was very easy to use.  It gives you Vitamin C with no calories.
5;good treat;When Gracie wants to go out, I don't know if it's to relieve herself or to, again, get some treats.  I haven't tried one, but she says more, more.
5;They loved this gift!;This gift made a HUGE impression on my recipient. She liked the giant cookie and remarked how original I was to send her such a unique gift.
5;great great great!!!;after trying this my daughter refuses any other baby food and if u taste it u will know why. its wonderful for them and taste really good.
5;Australia's healthiest export;"Vegemite <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Truly Delicious Truly Chocolate;This cocoa, Bellagio Chocolate Truffle Cocoa Mix, is this chocolate lover's<br />dream.  A topping of whipped cream (mit schlag) and I'm transported to the Vienna of my imagination.
1;NOT the real Worcestershire Sauce;Despite being sold under the same label, the Lea & Perrins available in the U.S.
5;Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry-The Yummiest Coffee!!;"I am a huge fan of ""foo foo"" (flavored coffee) and this is by far by favorite.  Lots of flavor."
5;Perfect 100 cal Snack!;I enjoy a low calorie snack in the afternoon to take the edge off my hunger.<br /><br />The Snyder mini pretzels do the trick.
2;Natural?;Although the product desciption tells you that it is all natural on the packaging, it is not. They have added high fructose corn syrup, Malic acid and Citric acid.
5;Luv my Heinz;I am forever buying the 2 ketchup, 1 relish, 1 mustard 4pack at Costco as my only way to get this item.  I end up giving away some ketchup and tossing the old relish when I have to buy the new because I've run out of mustard.
5;Patience Is Key;I purchased a 6-pack straight from Amazon themselves last holiday season. One was supposed to be for myself while the rest for my friends so they could try them out as mini Christmas gifts.
1;Bitter and acidic!;Got this k-cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small, 6 oz.
5;WARNING: Addictive!  Ohhhhh so good!;"These wafers need to come with a big warning ""Addictive""! It takes a lot of self control to stop eating them.  If I did not exercise a lot of self control I would eat a whole bag."
5;Better than Triscuits :);I love them.  My kids and I eat them a box at a time.
5;My Dogs LOVE the Flavor - And It Works;I have a 7 year-old Border Collie mix, Abbey, who has arthritic knees.  She had bilateral arthroscopic knee surgery about a year and a half ago to remove broken bone fragments in her joints.
5;Couldn't be happier;I went with Wellness because of the quality ingredients it offers unlike the run of the mill brands. I am pretty happy with the purchase and so is our dog.
4;Great product but not airtight;This product is a must-have for any parents making their own baby food and looking for an easy and convenient freezer storage solution. The 7 compartments can hold 2 oz each and the frozen food easily slips out of each compartment, thanks to the flexible silicone.
3;That's some weak coffee!;My roommate and I tried this one because she really likes the Kona Island blend from Coffee People. The first time we tried it was this morning and we brewed the largest size (travel mug sized).
5;Didn't know what to expect;I never bought or ate wasabi flavored seaweed snacks before so I had no idea what they would be like. They are light, crispy, medium-hot spicy chips.
2;Great if you like SALT!;The main ingredient in all of these spices is SALT. If you need to watch your salt intake steer clear of this product.
5;great;These are the same that you can buy at your local grocery. if you expect these to taste similar to a 5 star italian restaurant - youre a moron.
4;Tastes just like water....(nope, not a joke);Very interesting product to say the least.  Quite frankly I found this no different than any other water I have been drinking throughout my life, so if anybody is wondering how it tastes like, I hope this helps!  Whether or not different PH helps or hurts you, I cannot answer that as I am not a doctor nor do I play one in real life, but it was very good and very drinkable.
5;Excellent Vegan Bar;When you're vegan, you have to be prepared especially if you're going somewhere that isn't familiar. These bars taste good (they're not candy bar good, but they're also much healthier than a candy bar) and are convenient and not messy.
5;Like Spice? Get these;These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.
5;Delicious Organic Raw Honey!!;"I recently made a big move, and forgot to take the remaining 15 lb. tub of organic raw Canadian honey (from ""Tropical Traditions"") I bought this spring."
5;Hemp Protein Powder;After Consumner Reports came out with their results after testing protein powders, i.e.
1;Very disappointing!;I was very excited to try these to save money, rather than stopping for an iced tea on my way into the office. I've tried various ways of brewing: 8 oz setting into ice, combining two 6 oz settings over ice.
5;A must have for every pregnant woman;I have always wanted a natural delivery.  My friend who's had 2 other kids told me to take red raspberry tea leaf to strengthen our uterus, birth canal, etc.
4;I love them;I love the flavor, I'm so glad I did'nt listen to the negitive reviews, the only problem is thier so good I don't think they will last long..
5;LOVE this stuff!;As I said above, I LOVE this stuff. Yeah all capitals on love
5;Subtly Sweet;This reminds me of Cocoa Pebbles in granola form - and it is delicious! The granola isn't coated in chocolate, which is nice. There is a dusting of cocoa that gives it a little chocolate flavor without going overboard.
5;starbucks italian roast;My girl friend can not live with out this coffee. Not realy but it very convenient and cheaper than the drive through coffee.
4;crunchy and tasty healthy tortilla chip;These were a nice surprise..
5;Awesome Jerky;These are a great snack if you want something spicy and beefy.  The batch seems pretty fresh and they always taste great.
3;Just OK;I'm pretty new to being gluten free (about 4 months) and have been trying most anything I can get my hands on. At first bite there were good, but they have a funny after taste, to me they weren't very cheesy.
5;EXCELLENT salad dressing!!!!!;This dressing is comparable to fine dining restaurants!  I, family & friends absolutely LOVE it!  I haven't been able to find it lately & was delighted to find it on Amazon. I usually make it with olive oil & Heinz Apple Cider vinegar.
4;Seems good enough for my thick hair...;I am currently trying this conditioner out with a similar shampoo.  It works well with my thick hair.
5;Amazing packets of flavours and spices...very HOT!;The BBQ Chicken Mi Goreng flavor packs on the heat..
5;Great snack;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Delicious and somewhat addicting snack.;This is a wonderful snack.  Perfectly salted (light salt), very crunchy and satisfying.
4;Ginger Lover's Desert;Ginger Snaps are delicious.  Not too sweet and loaded with flavor.
2;Cups different;Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups. Coffee is fine, but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup, but drips considerably when removing to dispose.
4;Cat likes it, but doesn't help tartar;My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms.
5;This stuff is Awesome Sauce!!!;I love Kraft 3 Cheese Ranch dressing, it goes great on buffalo wings and chicken strips. It is so creamy and delicious, you have to go out and get some for yourself and you will know exactly what I mean when you taste it.
4;Great for Gluten Free and No White Sugar;I have Celiac Disease, and I try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum, and I was suprised by how good these are! The light crunch is a shock at first, but is tasty. It is a tad dry, so I am only giving 4 stars.
5;Thumbs up from the family!;Everyone here gave the Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Apple) a thumbs UP!  It was refreshing, not loaded with carbs!  Not too sweet!  Nice green apple flavor!  Nice size cans too!  If my teens will drink it, hey, I'm happy!  They loved it!  They did like the green apple better than the clementine..
3;"""Fresh Mixers"" to ""Lunch Express"" Not Good For Consumers";"Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former ""Fresh Mixers"" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars."
4;Great for bad dog breath!;The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it.
5;Tasteful Tazo Tea;Tazo Sweet Cinnamon Spice Tea is a very tasteful tea with no unpleasant after taste. I am not sure what a person can say about tea, but this flavor is one of the best I have ever had.
5;Great Sweetner;I got this same Blue Agave sweetener at Costco today and tried it on some frozen waffles and its good.  I was a little skeptical at first when I saw the product 6 months ago but now that I've tried it, I will definitely make a switch.
4;So Fido Doesn't Get Fat;"I had eliminated treats from my dog's diet when she started to lose her ""girlish"" figure. Turns out most treats have a lot of calories."
4;not enough in bag;My dog LOVES these(she tries to hide them to save for later)! The only thing I dont care for is that you dont get that many in the bag for the price paid..
5;Deelish!;"My husband and I use this on basically everything we throw on the grill or smoker. It's a good seasoning ""go to"" when you need something quick too."
5;So Flavorful and Aromatic!;I bought this while away on a trip so that I could create a barbecue flavor without buying barbecue sauce.  It has been a great seasoning for chicken and coconut milk, rice and beans so far and it will definitely add a Jamaican-style flavor to your cooking.
5;My best frieds love Cesar!;I have four small-to medium size best canine friends.  They absolutely adore Cesar and turn their noses up at anything else.
5;My kids love these!;Finally, a granola bar/go to snack I can feed my allergy ridden kiddo.  And it even tastes good!  We don't leave the house without these now in case hunger strikes at an unexpected moment.
5;Cattie likey;I wish I could say I had a very discriminating cat like some, but my Tomcat (no, I did not choose the name) falls into the try-to-stay-out-of-the-way category. He was very pleased with his first handful and just as pleased with his second.
5;Sugar Substitute;I don't like 99% of the sugar substitutes on the market, because when baking with them they give the baked item an after taste.  But this product does not do that.
5;I like it!;There are plenty of lemon flavored teas especially among well known brands.  I've bought most of them, used only a few tea bags and just didn't like them due to their artificial flavoring.
5;Meaty texture;Very meaty texture for a vegetarian product.  Looks like fresh ground beef after you mix it with water.
5;Tis Tasty;This a great seasoning, exploding with flavor that has the right amount of heat. We use this on just about everything from our eggs to our fried squash and our meats.
5;Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats;Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.
5;Love this product!;I was skeptical at first to try this product, because I thought it would make my hair dry and my scalp itch. I was so wrong! This product is thick, moisturizing, and nourished both my scalp and hair.
5;It warmed me up;I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea..
1;If I could give it zero stars I would...;I was really excited about trying these as I am a big fan of the other raspberry candies and they are very hard to come by. However, I was quickly disappointed after the first taste.
5;So yummy!;I LOVE this flavor!!!  Its smells fabulous when you open the packet and once its made it is a snow white color!  And the taste!  It is soooo good..
5;Great peanuts but not a good order;I have been a fan of Feridies Redskin Virginia Peanuts for many months. They are a staple in my pantry, and I have never had a single one that wasn't fresh and delicious.
5;using flavoring oils instead of extracts;There is no comparison between extract flavoring and oil flavoring when making Italian pizzelles..
5;Move over Jelly Belly, there's a new Bean in town!;I had been a Jelly Belly fan for a long time, but one day I picked up a bag of the Gimbal's Jelly Beans to give them a try. I have to say that I actually like them a lot better than Jelly Belly!<br />I find the candy to be softer and the flavor variety is great, not to mention that the price is so much better.
5;Good Chow;This is one of the best dog food's I have gotten yet.<br />My dog likes it and it is good for him.
5;A Good Chew;Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth.
5;Fantastic;I ordered this as a gift for my mother.  It took only three days for it to arrive in NJ.
4;Hazer Baba Turkish Delight;I bought Galil Almond TD and Hazer Baba Pistachio TD in the same order to compare.  The boxes are similar, but the Hazer is cheaper.
5;Best value;We go through Pamela's like crazy.  Fantastic for pancakes (we like to add a little vanilla to batter).
5;Love This Tangy Tea;I think I might be addicted !  This tea is so different, so tangy, it calls to me around 9 am when I am starting to drag and again later in the afternoon.  It is so zippy, unlike any tea I've had, its a real pick me up.
5;Thank you SweetLeaf!;We used to use Sweet-N-Low in our iced tea, coffee, etc.  I have become much more of a 'naturalist' so I starting using stevia.
5;Chews;The price is right for these chews.  My Australian Terrier loves them and I love how they keep her teeth clean.
5;Best flea spray on the market;I've tried all kinds of flea eradicating products in the past. This is by far the best.
2;Daughter doesn't like it;I bought this for my daughter but she doesn't like it.  She says it doesn't taste like chocolate.
5;Daisy the Yellow Dog takes care of her teeth--;"My buddy (some prudes would say ""my master"" but my guy is just another big dog to me) bought these chews for me.  We have long walks and long talks and both have better days."
5;Delicious popcorn.  Prefer the purple variety to the red.;Excellent popcorn.  Very tasty and cooks well in the microwave.
5;Yuuuh-uumm!;I am Diabetic and also food allergic (no lactose, gluten, soy or grapes), and these candies hit the spot.  They are yummy!  They taste just like a slightly sweet green apple and serve as a wonderful after-dinner sweet.
1;Taste Like Cardboard;This is the worst tasting tea ever. It really tastes just like cardboard and I am shocked that it doesn't have less stars.
5;Duncan Hines is my God;There is no price too high to pay for such a miracle of taste and science. Get this.
5;No Reason to Kill Innocent Animals for Jerky!;Primal Strips are delicious as well as cruelty free.  No sentient life was taken to produce them, and they're ultra low in fat and calories as well as high in protein.
1;Why Bother With This With So Many Energy Drinks on the Market?;I don't quite understand the proliferation of these squeeze bottle water additives when there are already so many energy and sports drinks on the market.  Trying to find the right mix that tastes right when you add it to water is not an easy task.
4;Bouquet sent many miles away;Other than the picture of the bouquet, I did't see it, but it made the person I sent it to very happy. The deliverly was also on time, which is another plus.
5;Good Gum;The gum was great and fresh.  Delivery was faster than i expected.
5;One of my favorites!;This coffee is amazing. I've tried multiple coffees and each time I come back to this one.
3;good alternative to soda;Sweet (maybe a tad too sweet), with a pleasant citrusy flavor, this beverage would be great to serve at kid's parties or at a barbecue instead of regular soda - the ingredient list is certainly less scary and afterall a sparkling water-and-fruit juice drink is obviously better than one loaded with refined sugar (or even worse, artificial sweeteners), caffeine and chemical addtitives.<br /><br />While this isn't a healthy drink, it would be a great improvement for a regular soda drinker to switch to this instead - the improvement may not show in calories but it will show in general health: the lack of caffeine and lower sugar content will avoid calcium loss so common in regular soda drinkers, and your liver will appreciate the lack of highly processed chemical additives.
3;Not Swisshot chocolate;This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.
5;Outstanding.;I make all my sauces from scratch, and ordered these from Amazon.  The tomatoes are peeled and packed in puree (not sauce), have a great flavor and consistency, break down nicely when cooked, and have a rich and meaty taste.
4;Tasty and good for a quick meal;If you're pressed for time and want something that's easy to prepare, filling, and that the kids will eat, this should suit just fine. I wouldn't eat just this for a meal, though, due to the high fat content.
5;Love baking with it!;So many natural recipes call for honey, but sugar isn't for me. I bought this to make almond flour chocolate chip cookies and it worked perfectly - I will now use it in other almond flour baked goods and easily maintain my weight.
4;"Great, not sure about ""blend""";Had I read the other review prior to ordering this brand, I probably never would have ordered it.  However, my experience with this olive oil led me to reorder 2 3-packs.
5;Great Maple Syrup;Better than the medium or dark amber grades, also would be a great gift.  Go ahead and try it.
5;a great product;This mix makes an excellent tasting flatbread and it is very easy to do. Keep several on hand.
5;Perfect;Just what I wanted to add flavor to hot drinks. I had to find a way to put tiny amounts into drinks.
5;love this and wont use any other brand;This pasta is really great. It has a better texture and is better for diebetics as it dosen't turn to sugar in the system as quickly.
5;Nothing else will do;"Seasoned Roasted Pretzels, only product that works is Paul's Blackened Steak Seasoning. Yumm<a href=""http://www."
5;Great tasting summer beverage;We like the regular Cappuccino and thought we would give this a try. If you follow the exact measurements we thought this had a really good taste to it.
4;Pretty Good;This soup is pretty good, not great! I put some heavy cream (1-2 oz) and some Tabasco in it. I have had a lot better Lobster Bisque - But at a much higher price.
4;fair trade chocolatey smooth but on the sweet side;"Yeah, the pkg says the Cocoa is Fair Trade Certified and it's made in Belgium and it has no trans fat and nothing artificial but it's first ingredient on its list is sugar and it has palm and/or canola oil.  It's not as sweet as candy as <a href=""http://www."
5;Love Blk;Love the black liquid and it tastes even better on ice. Would purchase again and again.
5;A classic!;What can I say! I love peanuts M&M's. I love them more than the regular kinds.
5;This is great quality tea;I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.
5;Medium Coffee;The brand of coffee is a nice medium brew.  I don't like coffee that is too bold or strong and this fits the bill.
5;More chocolate than you expect;Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.
5;great service;Bought this as a joke gift for my fiance (he is a smoker who is trying to quit).  The package arrived very quickly, in great condition and it was exactly what I expected.
5;Great little mini popcorn!;I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought.
5;Great baby food;My baby loves these. I like the fact that Amazon offers<br />A good variety.
3;No longer 100% Vitamins & Minerals;I would normally not have given Multi-Grain Cheerios just 3-stars. But General Mills recently changed the ingredients so that it's no longer fortified with 100% vitamins and minerals (might be sweeter, too).
3;Probably A Good Product, Just Not For Sweet Girl!;When I got these in the mail last Saturday and opened them up, put in a pill that she absolutely hates the smell of, offered it to her and she gulped it down we were thrilled to death!  We have not been able to get this dog to take this particular medication using everything from hot dogs to hamburgers and several kinds of cheese, so when she ate this thing like it was candy my wife and I were both excited.  Then that afternoon for her last dose for the day, same performance.
5;tasty and healthy!!;I recently tried some of this while on the road.  It it not available in my local grocery, so I am glad to see Amazon has it available!  This is very tasty granola and is great for people who love either granola or peanut butter.
5;PERFECT FOR PIZZA!;Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza.
5;an acquired taste;Some of my friends who I have offered these to say they taste like SOAP.<br /><br />And even I have to admit they have a very unusual taste, but that is what I love about them!<br /><br />AND they leave your breath smelling wonderful for a really long time afterwards.
5;I Begin Every Day with a Cup of Chai Latte;This is my favorite hot drink. I feel deprived if I don't have my Chai Latte.
1;I like bacon - I like mayo - I do NOT like this;I love bacon and mayo.  I thought this would be fun and interesting.
5;Crack for my dog;My dog loooves these treats. He's a 50 lb Rhodesian Ridgeback mutt and devours these! I'm not sure about the dental impact yet as he's only had them for 2 weeks or so.
5;Excellent honey!;Tropic Bee offers various honeys that are mixed with a bit of different citrus oils
3;Beware of Carpet Stains;My 35 lb cocker loves his new treat ball. The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it.
2;Not Very Good, But a Good Price;First I must say that this is not my kind of granola. I love crunchy granola, not soft, and this one is definitely soft.
5;Great product;We started making sushi at home and this seaweed was very easy to work with. You definitely need more than 10 sheets if you are experimenting.
5;Add some heat with not so much effect on the flavor;I discovered these in a restaurant, or actually several restaurants in the same area, although none would say where they got the chilis.  One finally brought the jar out.
5;Best Macaroon Ever!;Now here's the deal. I love coconut.
5;Addictive!;I really like these. One reviewer mentioned they have soy in them.
2;Ehh.;I'm convinced these things are a placebo.  After taking one per day for a week and noticing no difference, I 5-hour-energy roofied my roommate's soda before bed and he went to sleep without a problem.
5;If you want a dry cat food, this is the best.;My 2 nine month old cats have been on this cat food since they were kittens and they love it. All the ingredients are top quality and perfect for growing kittens.
3;Grainy and Bland;"Love the stats and idea of this cookie product.  Was looking for a ""cookie-type"" product for our healthy snack station at the office."
5;I love them;These are very good pop tarts.  My dad loves them too because he loves duplex cookies and he ate all of his very quickly.
5;Very Nice;I understand a few people don't care for the taste but personally I love it. The aroma is very nice at 6 o'clock in the morning.
5;sooooooooo goooooood;I have order these private reserve filet mignons before, and this is my first reorder. They are high quality steaks.
5;Yum yum;When I want a nice strong cup of coffee, Tully's French Roast is my choice.  Strong but not bitter.
5;viperron;I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises.
5;The best mild smoke flavoring;"I use this ""spice"" when grilling beef and hamburgers. Adds smoked flavor even when using a gas grill."
5;Tea for a Rainy Afternoon;I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other.
5;Loved it;This is a great trade off for bottled dressings.  I don't like bottled lowfat ranch but with these packets I can make my own easily and it tastes better than anything I can buy.
5;Delicious!;I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.
5;Absolutely Delicious!;So I've been doing P90X and have found that most protein shakes taste like dirty feet. I try and stomach it but have thrown away 3-4 different cans.
5;great taste;add to aniything!! soup, salad, meat..
5;Great Product!;I bought this product while searching for organic coconut oil for my hair. The price was great for this size compared to others.
5;Delicious;What can I say, it's beef and it's delicious. Not much more for me to say that isn't already included in the product description.
5;Good grains!;My flax and pumpkin seed granola is yummy. i eat it about four times a week and enjoy it.
4;Great cookie;These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins.
1;Not restaurant Sweet and sour;"This dose not have the same taste that you find in restaurants,(not even close) or the little packets they send home with take out. Not sure why it is so difficult to find ""real"" sweet and sour sauce."
3;Neo  water  9.5 ph ordered on Amazon.com;I don't think it was the water to blame.  I think I just didn't research it well enough before I ordered it.
5;Some tasty steak seasonings;I already knew these seasonings tasted great.  The only question was, is this a worth price?  I thought the cost was a little high, that is, until I saw the size of the bottle.
4;mild flavor;After reading some of the other reviews, I was expecting more flavor to the  tea.  It is good.
4;Good for the price;I think this stuff is pretty good. Nice texture, good flavor and there is a whole pound of it for $25 shipped.
5;Love them!;Have been making these muffins once a week for 9 years for my husband. He loves them.
5;New Favorite!;Yep - I'm totally sold!  And it's about time too :)  I love a strong / bold flavor that's not too bitter.  My favorite brands were Black Tiger by Coffee People and Extra Bold by Paul Newman.
5;AMAZING!;This dog food is awesome.  It smells so good and it could easily be consumed by humans! Speaking of.
5;Severe Gas Gone;We were using the regular Enfamil and my daughter had severe gas. It caused such pain that she couldn't sleep at night.
5;makes a wonderful snack mix;I do not eat this cereal in a bowl at breakfast, but bake a box with butter, romano cheese, and onion powder. Sometimes I add pretzels and nut.
5;perky;I have been using stevia quite often the past 5-6 months.  The English toffee is just one of the flavors we get.
5;Great for cooking and baths;Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt.
5;Great hard to find tea;I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.
5;The ultimate in cat-related hallucinogenics;"They must call is ""Cosmic"" catnip because your cat will be so high it will feel like she's on a rocketship to the center of the Milky Way, head spinning and meowing and dropping by the 7-11 for Kitty Cheetos. If there is anything about cats that we don't understand (and I think that list could go on for a while) it's how cats go absolutely nuts for the smell of catnip."
5;Great Product;My siblings and I grew up eating Saladitos.  When we moved away from Arizona we couldn't find them anywhere.
5;great product;I ordered this to go in my wedding favor boxes.  They were exactly what I was looking for.
1;Planned Obsolescence!;Initial set up of the Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is easy, just unscrew the cap and remove the liner. It has a surprisingly rich set of standalone and integrated food possibilities and the addition of vitamin D was a bonus.
5;finally an easy to get &  make gf option;I read the reviews and purchased a couple of boxes yesterday. My daughters had friends over so I  made them.
5;Good value conitioner/moisturizer;I read about the miracles of coconut oil. Though it is not what I would call miraculous I would say it does a nice job.
5;great taste and price;There are a ton of meal replacement products out there. It really boils down to taste and price.
4;worked well for young active boys;We had tried to find a drinkable nutrition shake for our pre-teen son.  He plays competitive soccer and is thin.
5;Very Good!;The tea taste is very good, I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy, many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus.
5;Best Tea Ever;Once upon a time we drank coffee.  We bought the best beans, ground our own beans, brewed each cup or pot carefully using good water, until we had the flu.
5;These Rock!;I am trying to lose a few pounds and am on Weight Watchers, these are the best chips around.  I love potatoes and can not keep them out of my diet, these are tasty and low in fat and not drenched in oil.
5;my dogs go crazy for Greenies;My chihuahua and pomeranian get so excited when I bring out the teenie dental chews after their meal--I hope these are always in stock as I buy them frequently. It does seems to help reduce the tartar on their teeth and it's exceptionally high in protein unlike other treats.
5;Never thought I would eat canned chilli....;I ordered this chili at the request of my parents.  They ate it in Montanna and loved it.
5;Critical for Marzipan!;We use this product to make marzipan. It is a critical ingredient.
4;Great Green Tea;I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.
3;Dog seems to like them but man do they stink!;These treats are really greasy and stinky and only suitable for outdoors. However, because of that the dog really likes them.
5;Exceptional tea;Great tea, delicious, and really relaxing. I usually have it after supper, and man does it help me unwind and get really relaxed.
3;Tasty but broken;These cookies are very tasty.  Mildly sweet & satisfying.
5;Delicioso!;This is very good coffee. I will definitely purchase it again.
5;Worth every penny;Awesome, great product. They cost $1.
2;Choose another flavor!;I really like many of the Special K products, but this one is lousy. The chocolate tastes very chemical-y, and I'm just thankful that my kids will eat it so I don't have to throw it all out.
2;Wheatgrass, Natures Finest Medicine, but look close;The 2 star rating is because what you appear to see is not what you will receive, unless someone has started to make a less than 1 gallon container that looks exactly like a 5 gallon container, I have never seen one but I suppose it is possible. What you appear to see is a 5 gallon container, so please look close before you buy.
5;SOOOO GOOD;"Delicious candy.  I wish they made the same thing in a ""hard"" version."
4;YUMMY:);We ordered a case of these without never having tried them before and were pleasantly surprised..
2;Most of the Cans Were Dented;I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house.
2;Stale Stale Stale;Order arrived promptly via Amazon Prime, but the Happy Colas were very stale.  The gummies in every pack were hard as rocks.
5;perfect pancakes and waffles everytime!;for gluten free pancakes and waffles, you can't beat this.  Fabulous in taste, texture, time and ease in making.
5;Good product;Good product at a good price. Taste is better than most, very mild, and not overpowering by any means.
5;Best waffle mix....;I've got to have tried half a dozen different waffle mixes..
5;VERY SATISFIED;These fries are the BEST!!  They are low fat/calorie and great tasting.  I've have lost over 20 pounds eating these as my snack.
5;Best Dog Food Ever!;Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully.
4;great syrup;This stuff makes a great tasting chocolate milk.  I'll gladly buy it again in the future when the current stock runs out.
5;Coffee Delicious!;If you like coffe with a smooth taste and not the bite, this is for you.  If you like to chew your coffee, and want it thick and dense, don't buy this.
5;Best food ever!;These pouches are amazing!  They were great when the girls were on baby food and they are still great even at 19 months old.  I take the pouches everywhere.
5;An excellent buy;This is a high quality oolong tea, very tasty, I agree that it does not need to be sweetened.  Vacuum sealed for freshness.
5;Best hard candy ever;I happened to fall upon these candies at a little store in Oakland, Oregon and absolutely fell in love with them. The Green Apple and Wild Cherry flavors are by far my favorite.
1;Defective;This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups.
5;Perfect for celiacs and cake lovers alike;I recently tried this mix for my stepson's birthday party. At first, I was also put off by the 'beany' smell to the batter.
2;Great Idea but poorly executed;"This is a really really great idea, just poorly executed. One ""squeeze"" is all you need."
5;Wonderful!!;great dog biscuits. not super easy to break apart, but easier than most.
4;Delicious tea;This is an amazingly rich, sweet and smooth cup of tea.  I absolutely love it and had to purchase a special little tea pot just for this tea, that is how special the tea is.
5;amazing tahina!;Alwadi has the best home made Tahina! Even without adding water, lemon and garlic it has a great taste. Price is fair for a high quality.
5;Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! highly Recommended;This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs.
5;Delicious!;Lavazza makes great coffee and espresso, and the Lavazza Bar & Caffetteria Espresso Decaf Dek is no exception. It's not to bold, but has a wonderful distinctive taste.
5;Yum;Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as jalepeno smoke, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts.
5;i'm obsessed...;i'm watching my calorie intake - and after reading all the reviews, i had to try this.<br />its truly amazing.
3;"Good tasting soup - ""Instant"" is a bit of a stretch.";I thought the taste of this soup was very good.  Each serving comes in two packets.
4;Great;Great product and very tasty. The photo looks exactly the same as the product.
5;Just what I was looking for;I don't usually write reviews, but I'm happy to write one about this.  Finally, I've found a lemonade mix made with good old fashioned sugar and NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS!  I think it's a bit sweet for my taste so I like to squeeze a fresh lemon into the pitcher with a little extra water and it's perfect.
5;Southeastern Mills Gravy;Liking to play in the kitchen and trying different recipes, I tried the Southeastern Mills Brown Gravy for a English Roast that was slow cooked. The flavor is so unique and out of the ordinary.
4;Delicious Energy Bars;"These bars are dense with nutrition.  The plethora of organic ingredients reads like a ""what to eat"" health guide."
4;A COOKIE not a CANDY;This is a tasty product, but the label can be misleading. It is a thin chocolate COOKIE and not a thin chocolate mint CANDY.
3;Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth;My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.
5;This is a staple in my kitchen.;There is not much I can tell anyone who already uses Mrs. Dash.
5;Chocolate Lab Puppy;My chocolate lab puppy is killing this product.  His 8 week visit he was 11 lbs and yesterday i took him for his 10 week appt and he is now 16.
5;Be careful with these!;My dog goes bonkers for these treats. She's used to pretty good treats.
2;Misleading information;The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches.  In each pouch, there is two bars.
3;Good supplier and product;The supplier emailed me to check whether I wanted green or black berries which I thought was an impressive followup. The berries arrived in a plastic bag when I was expecting a glass container as per the advertising pitcure.
5;Great for chocoholics;These cookie-cakes are pretty darn good and chocolatey. A bit too sweet for my taste because of the marshmellow layer doesn't prevent me from scarfing down a few, and I do so guilt-free.
5;Keeps my Yorkie busy!;I love buying treats for my dogs and when I came across this in Amazon, I knew I had to buy it for my Yorkie to help her with her bad breath (CET Toothpaste helped as well!).  I was worried she won't like it coz it doesn't have the usual scent of a dog treat (meat, lamb, chicken, etc.
5;Natural Calm;This product is perfect for what I needed--something easy on my digestive system that would help with muscle cramps.  It's very effective, and even better, it tastes good.
3;Cheaper at Sam's;If anyone has a membership to Sam's Club, they have this type of SB coffee, same count box for $38.  Just a head's up.
5;I can't say enough;about these dog chews/treats. they keep my dog busy for hours and get her need to chew out on something meant for a dog and not one of our shoes, furniture, etc.
5;Easier than pan frying;I place a paper towel on the grilling plate and another on top to absorb grease and find that works for me.  Also microwave times vary according to the brand and thickness of the bacon.
2;Way too weak for my tastes;What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets.
5;You can't eat just one!;Strawberry Whoppers are one of our very favorite candies.  Fortunately they are relatively inexpensive because once we open a box we eat them all.
3;Healthy but not very tasty;I tried this because I thought that it might be a useful healthy snack to keep at work.  Tried it at home as a cereal.
5;Perfect for hostess gifts or party favors;This is a delicious preserve that we buy at the grocery store so I was really happy to find it in this miniature size.  I included it and the Bonne Maman mini honey jar in a favor bag for a baby shower.
5;Superb Teas!;After receiving a gift card for Amazon, I had to buy this tea sampler box.  My wife and I both love tea and have it at least every other day if not more often.
2;It's Peanut Butter made with Almonds.;So the Almond Butters that I've had and grown to love have an almond taste.  This is really just peanut butter.
5;YUM!;I LOVE these. But, be warned, they are CALIENTE! Even though my lips turned red and my nose bleed from the first bag, I went back for more and more and more! There are awesome
5;Taste like lychee;This stuff is cheap, and taste like lychee.  The quality is so much better than the lychee syrup from the can.
1;Surprise coconut flavor;I buy several of the Think Thin bar flavors - tried this one and found, to my dismay, that it has a pronouonced coconut flavor, which is okay if you like coconut.  Flavor is darker, but muddier, and ingredients list a fractionated palm kernel oil, which is not in the other bars I buy.
4;A Nice Water Enhancer;Water is nice and much healthier than the alternative but sometimes it is nice to have an extra kick to the plain water.  Vitamin Squeeze is different than other water additives because of, well, the vitamins.
4;Finally a natural treat that my Rottie loves;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Caffiene Lover decreases caffiene;I love breakfast tea, but during the cooler days, I've found that drinking it later in the day affects my night time sleep quality. This tea gives me the flavor I want without the buzz.
3;Poor Substitute;We have purchased Emiril's Vanilla Bam coffee for years. I'm not a big Emiril fan, but the vanilla coffee was excellent.
4;Wrong bag pictured;Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula.
5;fast service, product as described;I received the product as described, and it was very fast service. I would buy it from this seller again.
5;Too yummy for words!;I wish I had ordered more of these!  They were definitely fresh when I received them and the taste was great.  The bad part is that my family and friends discovered my stash and the candy kept disappearing.
3;Good Enough;This food is OK but the dogs don't like it that much.  They would rather have the beef variant.
5;This is my favorite mix.;I have tried several different brands of mixers. This is my favorite.
5;Vegan Organic  Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;Pups LOVE these and they fit in a small kong.;My two doxies LOVE the fruitable treats & they fit in the original petite KONG.  So, they get a fruitable in their KONG toy every workday morning when I leave for work.
5;Great seasoning!;We use California Style Onion Powder on almost everything we cook.  What other seasoning can you say this about other than salt and pepper?  It makes meat and vegetables taste better.
4;A hit with my family;I sent a box of nuts to my parents and to my brother's family. They arrived quickly and they loved them.
5;Great treat for a great toy;This flavor and the Barbecue seem to be my dog's favorite, although he does love the liver flavored one as well.  Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like.
2;Taste terrible, way too strong;Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.
3;Great Quality, Low on Quantity;I bought these after having a minor freak out about Chinese made products, especially those made of meat - it's hard to trust, and I just won't do it.<br /><br />That said, my dog loves these and I have no problem with the product's quality.
5;My four cats love this;
5;Great Organic Sweetner;Excellent substitute for white sugar, without the side effects of white<br />sugar.  I love it on my hotcakes instead of the high calories of regular<br />syrup.
4;A good deal for health food;This mix is easy to use, has high nutrition and no added sugar stuff, and it costs less than in local store. Saves bother to buy in bulk and scheduled shipments save even more money and time.
1;sugar by any other name;One of the listed ingredients is listed as evaporated cane juice. Sure sounds like sugar to me.
5;Lifetime Linketts Lover =D;I've been eating Linketts since I was a very young child since my Grandparents are vegetarians, and I LOVE them.  I will admit it is a very aquired taste.
5;Yummmm;"Loved it. Hot hot hot (and I love hot, but this sauce is on the ""very hot"" side of the spectrum even for me - which is a definite plus!!!), with a pleasant smoky flavor so characteristic of the ""regular"" Sriracha in a bottle."
5;Recommended for picky kitties;My cat is has medium length hair, but gets some crazy hairballs, and these are the only treats we use now. She just gets one at bedtime and begs for it, she loves it so much (and she is very picky.
5;I really do like this dressing;Tangy, zesty, spicy, but not too much.  It turns any left over vegetables into a salad.
5;Excellent;I highly recommend these from Omaha Steaks. They taste fantastic and no grease like most other burgers you can make yourself.
2;Acceptable tea;This tea, while a step up from ordinary Lipton black tea, is NOT a gourmet tea.  If you want to taste what a great black tea tastes like try Tevana's black pearl or one of the 4-5 star rated black teas on Teaspring.
4;purchased mauna loa macadamias;received the ordered item on the date promised. nice product, yummy! looking forward doing bussiness with you again.
4;Medically necessary;This formula was recommended by our pediatric surgeon to prevent constipation.  My daughter has transitioned from breast milk to the formula at 9 months and is doing well.
2;Falls short of a dark chocolate experience.;Looks like they didn't really taste test this product.  Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it.
5;Excellent!;Creme de la creme of sea salt. Great taste and I love the color!<br />Perfect size granules to use for a table or cooking salt.
4;Fair Substitute for no local Starbucks;Overall I've been very pleased with Starbucks' VIA products.  I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.
5;Delicious!;It's my favorite hazelnut creamer in a much larger package than you're used to seeing at the grocery store, so it will last for several months. Everything arrived intact and the expiration date is well in the future.
1;Very Dissapointed!;I ordered these snacks because I had tried the apple cinnamon kind and loved them so much. The apples were crispy and delicious and the nutrition information was very reasonable with low calories, no fat, and high fiber.
5;Wonderful product of nature!;I recently had abdominal surgery. My Dr.
5;"Here's How We Play ""Fatal Attraction""";"My wife is a big Glen Close fan, and I think Michael Douglas is one of the best actors of the 20th century.  We love quoting the lines from ""Damages"" and ""Wall Street,"" but when Friday night really gets cooking (if you know what I mean), we like to play ""Fatal Attraction"" -- the romantic game that's sort of, well, the grown-up equivalent of spin the bottle, which we remember playing back in seventh grade."
5;PERFECT;COULDNT FIND IT AT THE COAST, BUT AMAZON CAME THROUGH. QUICK DELIVERY.
3;spicy pumpkin seeds;For some reason these seeds did not agree with me.  I wish for something with some flavor but these won't work for me.
1;Wrong Label;"The box says decaf, but they have a ""REGULAR"" label over top the decaf with a barcode. I ordered 2 of these, both had to go back."
5;They are a great crunchy, salty, low carb snack!;These things are great if you're on a low carb diet, and I find them really satisfying.  If you're looking for some kind of gourmet cheese item, this isn't it
3;A decent vegan snack, tbut with some drawbacks.;The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot.
1;product of china;Product of China.  Unhappy that the other reviewers did not mention this as it is clearly labeled on the back of the individual packs and the cardboard box that the packs are sealed in.
4;A good bunch of mixed dried mushrooms;I tried the Angenlina's Gourmet wood ears, which were OK but not great, and these as well. These are a good mix of a variety of dried mushrooms.
4;Happy baby, happy mama!;My son just recently started eating baby food, all made at home. I wanted to try something that was a bit more portable and didn't require refrigeration, so when we travel it's still easy to feed.
4;Tea & Passion;I have alwyas been interested in trying new drinks that have been quite appealing. That was the case with Chantea, and their Alone Vera Green Tea & Passion Fruit drink.
5;My cat loves these!!;My cat loves these. He has always liked cat treats such as Pounce, but they always made him sick.
5;Great Dark Roast!;If you love a really dark roast full bodied cup of coffee this is it.  Low acidity, very dark oily beans, tons of flavor.
5;An Absolute Favorite;These treats are my cat's favorite. They go nuts for it.
5;A spectacular tea, bursting with flavor;This is without question the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. The flavors are amazing, naturally sweet, complex, and spicy.
5;"Great ""No-Grain"" Cat Food";Vet told us to get cats off grains so we tried many non-grain products. This is the only one that they really like.
4;Dingo mini-bones;Our dogs love these..
5;This stuff is great;I buy this product for my two cats. I know there are dogs on the cover, but they sure go ape $#!^ for these chicken bits.
3;Tastes good but...;This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:<br /><br />34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff.
5;Delighted with Amazon.com;I am always pleased with the variety of shopping items, that I find on Amazon.com.
4;Quite good for the baby that has not yet or is in the process of teething;We bought the pack of 6 almost five months ago for our baby boy and we still have one left after giving several of them away. He likes them and will eat them, but he is not mad about them.
4;Great Tea, don't buy online;I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor.
5;best coffee;This coffee is tops  Smooth great flavor  Great if you make ice coffee..
4;This tea's different;I'm definitely a fan, I don't dislike the tea, but it's very different from what I expected.<br /><br />I suppose having any expectations would be silly since I haven't tried this tea before, but somehow in my mind I had imagined it to be a light and refreshing tea overall.
2;Too small for the price;I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin.
5;These toffee bits rock!;Once upon a time one could purchase toffee bits in grocery stores. I've used brickle bits in muffin recipes, for pie crusts, over ice cream.
5;Canadian Wild Crab Cluster 10lb;I was very pleased with the customer service spoke with Dan Wholey,who made sure the second order of crab legs was shipped perfectly.I have to say that I when I am ready to order more crab legs that the Wholey family will be at the top of my list.
4;good oil;very nice flavor. it's good for frying or on a salad.
5;new guiltless pleasure;I came across these on a dinnerless night while waiting in line at Marshall's. I think i had most the bag gone before i got to a cashier.
4;very good soda .. its something different and worth trying;I have always been somewhat of a soda aficionado since the days of Pepsi, Dr pepper etc. My grandparents owned a little corner grocery store so I'd get to try some of the new sodas that came out.
5;The Best Olive Oil I have ever Tasted;I had this Olive Oil in St. Remey France, last week,at Cafe la Place.
5;Salmon Feline Pill Pockets at a great price;My cats enjoy their fish flavored treats. The Pill Pockets are a great way to hide the medicine and provide a treat.
1;It's not salty, it's salt!;Bought it because it's on sale, but it turned out to be a super disappointment.<br /><br />Like the others said, it's not edible.
1;Not really lemon grass flavored!;I'm asian and use lemon grass A LOT! This tastes nothing like lemon grass. Not even sure how to describe the flavor.
5;Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling;These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.
4;Perfect for those days when you don't have time;If you are like me and you like your coffee plain or with just a little milk than this is for you.  I like the Starbucks doubleshots but I don't really like my coffee sweetened.
5;Barlean's Coconut Oil - Great Product;This oil is amazing. It smells good
5;Great cookies;It is tough to find allergen-free snacks that taste and have the texture of regular foods.  These Outback Animals are  just  like regular animal crackers.
5;Wonderful Tea;Still my only favorite green tea to drink, and yet Amazon is the only place I can find it, because none of the other stores sell it around here. It is delicious beyond words.
5;oh god...;SO GOOD.<br />Just in case anyone was wondering.
4;Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious);These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor.
5;Great decaffeinated tea!;This is the second time I have ordered this tea in bulk. My boyfriend and boyfriend's mother LOVES this tea.
4;Pleased with it;Taste was decent, a little sugary, but very creamy otherwise. Very happy with this product.
5;DELIOUS;I gave part of these in baskets for Christmas gifts and part for myself. Everyone loves them.
4;HUBBY IS A CLOSET TEA DRINKER;I purchased this for my Hubby. It's another great tea by Celestial Seasonings.
4;Nice strong brew;As expected, this is a good strong cup of coffee. Although the flavors are subtlety different, I also enjoy the French roasts from Tulleys and Starbucks.
4;GUILT-FREE PeanutButter!  Who Knew?;This is a GREAT alternative to peanutbutter for those watching fat, carbs or calories.  Comparing 190 calories for 2 TBLS to 15 calories for PB2, is unbelievable.
5;I put it on everything;I love it.  It's delicious.
5;great chips;"My parents were visiting us in Las Vegas from the east coast. I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said ""you have to try these chips, (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy."
4;Run Of The Mill Trail Mix Bars;I shared a box of these with my family and though we all enjoyed them, we uniformly thought they were about as good as the other brands. I.
5;Richly sweet and smoky.;Superbly smooth brew with a cedar-smoke taste upfront and light chocolate finish. The smokiness returns in a complex and soothing aftertaste that clouds your breath.
1;Good if you want to lose weight;You are guaranteed to lose weight with this product as it tastes so bad, you will not want to eat more than a few tablespoons. It is salty and has a bitter taste to boot.
1;Not one I would buy again;Don't know if the box of Jocalat bars I got was just not fresh or what but they were awful. Loved the Cherry and Apple Pie, Pecan was ok but these were like a dry brick.
5;"Which is it? ""14oz box, pack of 14"" or ""Pack of seven, 14 ounces each (total of 98 ounces)"" ?";"Which is it? ""14oz box, pack of 14"" or ""Pack of seven, 14 ounces each (total of 98 ounces)"" ?  The description on this and the rice chex is contradictory. And I would have believed the 'written' description (it being 7), except that (a) this would be like $7/box which would be crazy expensive and a bit unusual, and (b) people 'referenced' 14, except maybe those reviews were prior to having received the order, it was hard to tell."
5;scooper;I love this oat bran. I add this to my Greek Yogurt in the morning to start off my day.
5;Summer in a bottle!;This is a cross between fresh watermelon, and watermelon candy.  Its really good!  Try it in some seltzer water or lemon lime soda.
5;My Dog has an Addiction...;Our small Pomeranian Poodle mix is addicted to these things.  She will actually sit and stare at the cabinet where we keep them, and try to get us to follow her to the cabinet in order to beg for them.
1;Was Not Impressed;This cheese is best described as solidified sour cream with a faint hint of blu.<br /><br />I tried to like it and feel around for the flavor, but the sour cream taste overpowers whatever the unique flavor of the mold might have.
1;Never again!;"I purchased this thinking ""what a great deal!"" Now I know why it was, and it really is a bad deal! First off, several containers were defective. The top parts were not secured (they flipped up), so the screw off top wouldn't work properly."
5;Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil;I started using the extra virgin coconut oil and I am very pleased with it. I use for my hair, as a lotion and I put it in my cereal.
4;Dogs devour them, does it clean their teeth?;I have two dogs, 22 pounds and 45 pounds. Got the large size which is supposed to be for 50-100 lbs.
4;Delicious toaster pastries...;All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.
5;My girlfriend likes it;With British food's reputation for tasting like recycled garbage, and a dubious name at best, Spotted Dick sounds more like leftovers from the Saw movies than anything edible.  Nonetheless, I gave some to my girlfriend.
1;CHECK THE EXP DATE!!!;I JUST REC'D THE CHICKEN ONE TODAY 8/2/12  I ALWAYS ALWAYS CK THE DATES OF EVERYTHING I EAT OR DRINK..
5;Never Go Wrong With Mon Cheri;I love this product. I always have these in my home during the holidays.
5;Delicious snack;Great flavor.  I snack on these when I need a boost of energy.
5;I like it!;I was really surprised by the St. Dalfour Three Beans with Sweet Corn.
5;Love Bold Coffee;Very fast shipping, this is one of my favorite Senseo coffees.  Just the perfect bold flavor.
5;Great Supplier;Product delivered quickly and item was as advertised.  No complaints here, I recommend this seller on a very high scale.
5;Delicious and crunchy!;Big, crunchy ribbons of coconut that look a little like paper gone through a shredder to give you an idea of the shape. While not very substantial, these are very tasty little morsels.
1;Not for me.;I don't like the taste at all, look like a cheap coffe. I won't buy it next time.
5;Best Tea Ever;I tried this tea in a sampler pack and became totally addicted!  I moved and could not find any stores that carry the flavor so I have to buy online.<br /><br />It is a very sweet and strong tea that requires no sugar or milk.
3;Was just okay;I tried this soon after it arrived. It is crunchy and has good ingredients, but something in it tasted a bit weird to me.
3;Weak but okay;Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.
1;If you're diabetic or on a low-sugar diet (like South Beach), don't buy this!!;For whatever reason, the sugar in this product isn't mentioned in the advertising. If you check the ingredients, the 1st one listed is evaporated cane juice, which is sugar, although a natural form of it, and sugar (the regular kind) is also listed a few ingredients later.
5;Good Stuff;Bold tasting coffee, not for someone that dosent like a strong tasting coffee. I have bought this coffee a few time and I really like it.
5;These cherries are great.;I was very pleased with these dried cherries.  They are delicious -- not too sweet, not too tart.
5;family fav;This is so convenient. I get this auto delivery.
1;Weak Coffee with Lestoil!;This is the absolute worst flavored coffee I ever put in my mouth.  I took several sips to be sure I hated it.
5;Best Popcorn Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor.
5;Great sauce for fish or chicken!;This sauce makes it so easy to make fish and chicken taste so much more interesting.  It is a unique blend of sweet and spicy (but not too spicy)!  I usually saute fish in a little olive oil.
5;Pick dog pick;I had a really picky dog who refuses any kind of biscuit type treat offered to him.  He eats some soft treats and loves these.
5;BEST OF THE FOUR FLAVORS !;These chips look very much like a Dorito but they pop or snap more when chewing I think these are the best of the 4 Flavors maybe too spicy for some but i like that they have some kick ! If you like a little spice these are great if you have a weak stomach you may need to try the milder seasalt version ! Enjoy..
5;Parimgiano Reggiano;This was a gift for a person who is of Italian descent and who loves to cook. She said the cheese was of excellent quality.
5;My doggies love 'em!;These are a hit with my two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.<br />These are nutritious snacks by the one and only Newman's Own company.
2;disappointed in price not product;I was in a hurry when I ordered this item and was quite surprised by the $16 price tag..
5;A Good Choice;This is a classic ramen choice.  Our kids, 3-6 love this.
5;Wolfgand Puck Rodeo Drive K-cup;This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.
5;jeezy;these are so cute and make a nice gift. the flavors are very good, I will buy this product again.
5;Fantasic!;This was the best stuff for my first trimester!  Even my husband enjoyed nibbling on it. Not too sweet and full of ginger flavor.
5;I buy them six at a time.;I buy them six at a time, my German Shepherd goes through one a week. I will purchase these again and again.
1;Not what I thought;These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.
5;Love these...;My favorite, all around snack bar. Total love that it's not overly sweet.
5;always great product.great delivery;I'VE been ordering this product for 5 years.its always great product and quick delivery.
5;Great gravy and healthy too!;I love these organic gravies I bought called Quick Gravy.  It's so nice to know I'm eating something healthy and not eating all the processed gravies out there.
2;Break easily;My dogs are not rough at all, one is 4 years old and still has toys from when she was a puppy.  Within one week, she broke the cap into 3 pieces anf got all the kibble, Superglued it back together which lasted another week.
3;Chocolate flavored PB;I had to try this product just in case it was heaven in a jar. I mean.
5;Perfect all natural Dog Food - we pay only $47.00 + tax!;Priced too high!!!<br />We buy this food at a Feed store and pay $47.00 + tax!<br />Our 6 dogs love this food.
5;SO GOOD!;I discovered this candy bar at the checkout counter in the grocery store.  I have always liked the original Snickers, but when I saw it with almonds, I was instantly intrigued.
2;Mixed Opinions;My girlfriend said this was one of the worst coffees ever and it needed four packets of sweetener plus rum to be drinkable.  I found it slightly better than average.
5;Good Stuff;I first found this in my local supermarket and now get it thru Amazon. Just got a 15 lb'er that came the next day.
3;Great coffee but very pricey;Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ..
5;My favorite Tea!!! No other Raspberry compares!!!!;My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping.
1;Not a good deal;You can find this cheaper at Rite Aid, even after they raised their prices $2.99/bar.
5;Love it!;I bought this product so I can make miso soup at home.  It turns out perfect every time.
4;Powerful blue;This is a terrific blue cheese, from Australia of all places.  It leaves a strong, but delicious, aftertaste, with a bit of a bite.
1;Made in CHINA! Choking Hazard!;I was horrified to find out this product is made in China!  Before realizing that, I did give it to my 5 month old baby. She liked it, but I had to watch her VERY closely.
4;Made my dog very happy;I have a pit girl who just had her first birthday and I got her one of these as her birthday present. The first thing she did when I handed it to her was run into her crate (which she NEVER uses anymore) so that, in her mind, we couldn't take it away from her.
5;Good coffee.. but Amazon keeps raising price on this!;The coffee is perfect if you love dark strong coffee. Try it!<br />My only complaint is prices has gone up $5 for this product since 09/10, time for Amazon to review the prices.
1;Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!;Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.
5;Great for cooking!!;I initially bought this for my hair (crazy I know)after seeing it on a hair forum.  When it arrived, I chickened out and used it for cooking.
3;Expiration date Far too Short!;These veggie chips taste great..
5;Black Tiger;I've had a keurig Coffee Maker for 3 years . I've tried many different types and brands of coffee and keep coming back to Coffee People's Black Tiger.
5;And I don't even like Vanilla . . .;I don't like vanilla as a stand alone flavor. Usually, it is just a pale imitation of the rich smoothness of a real vanilla bean.
5;ssweet!;fair trade, better than fair price and double blind taste test with name brand was fair and couldn't tell the diffence.  i will purchase this product again.
5;Yay!;This thing is the BEST packet milk tea on the market
5;Lifetime healthy breakfast;I first heard about this cereal 3 years ago and have eaten it EVERY morning since then! A delicious, filling but not bloated breakfast that gets me started every day. I take a little more than a third of a cup and place  it in a DEEP dish rectangular microwave safe bowl with about three quarters cup of water for 6 minutes and 10 seconds.
4;Not bad;I am by no means a coconut expert but, I do know taste. Roland's coconut milk is light and creamy, with a hint of coconut.
5;I'm picky and I pick Jeremiah's Pick;My friend Don gifted me with a bag of Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Fogbuster whole bean coffee.  I figured that HUGE, 5-pound bag would last me forever.
4;Green Tea Rocks! This place ships fast too.;I love green tea ice cream. Thats why i bought this product so i could add it into my ice cream maker and it was delicious! I also added it into sugar cookies making them green tea as well.
5;Delicious chocolate flavored coffee;With all the fancy coffees out there, I was pleasantly surprised that good ole Folgers had such a great flavored coffee. It has a lovely smooth chocolate flavor that warms up your day.
5;The Best!;I have been searching for this style in every store and can't find it anymore. This is what I used to eat as a kid.
1;poorly packaged;Several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. Jars are cheaper at Walmart.
3;Donut House Cinnamon Roll;The smell is very nice, but the taste is a little on the weak side.  Overall not too bad, I just wish the taste was a bit bolder.
5;The everything oil..;This is a must have for all households..
4;good deal, good taste;I really like the Grove Square Cappuccino - I hope they continue at good prices.  I will be getting more - I have all 3 flavors - maybe you can make some more flavors.
4;Dried Tomato Sprinkles;"Unfortunately, there is not enough ""twang"" in these tomatoes but they are good.  Definitely like them in hummus and in tomato sauces."
2;Stash Chocolate Mint tea;Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste.
5;YUMMO!;This is the best hot sauce ever! It has the right amount of heat with tons of flavor. I have the red sauce and can't wait to try the green sauce.
4;Cat seems to like it;Can't give it five starts because I am not the end user of this product, but the cat seems to eat it, so it can't be that bad. She comes running when I put the food in the bowl if that means anything.
2;loose stools;Actually caused my dog to have bad diarrhea.  We have a border collie who has been on a raw diet due to allergies and we wanted to try a grain free kibble to see if it would be easier to travel with.
5;My favorite flavored coffee;I prefer flavored coffees and this one and the pumpkin spice are my absolute favorites. The chocolate and raspberry go so well with the coffee that it's like drinking dessert.
5;Maggie's Favorite;We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite. They don't get messy like other chew treats and her breath smells so much better, even better than the dental milkbones out there.
5;Awesome coffee flavored;My family has owned a Keurig for about 6 or 7 months now and we have been buying this specific k cups since then. They have a very good flavor.
1;Product description is wrong;"The Amazon description is wrong. In the one I saw, the ingredients list was pretty simple, with no artificial sweeteners or ""weird"" additives."
5;use it all the time;My mother cooked with it, and I regularly cook with it -- when I can find it.  It's the perfect addition to roasts, to stuffing, to skinless chicken, to stews, and any meat dish that needs a pick me up.
5;7 cats are rating 7 paws up;I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry.
5;Best Earl Grey I've Ever Brewed;This tea is outstanding by any measure.  The sense of quality begins when one first opens the bag: The aroma of heavenly, citrus-y (expensive) bergamot oil fills the kitchen.
5;Goya;This is a great product.  After ordering, I got notification that it was being sent right out.
3;Very Strong;This coffee is OK, I have yet to buy a k-cup that has the same body that a regular brewed cup of coffee has. While this is strong in taste (almost too much), it lacks something that a regular drip brew has, almost kind of watery.
4;Not bad for a canned mushroom;I've never had a canned mushroom that comes close to what a fresh `shroom tastes. The canning process really does a number on the texture, and dials down the taste big time.
5;Amazing -  best almond butter I've ever tried;I became an almond butter fan years ago because of all the health benefits.  It wasn't until I tried Barney Butter that I totally abandoned peanut butter all together - this stuff is amazing - and you can cook with it too - use it in place of anything calling for peanut butter for a much healthier alternative.
5;Addictive!;This are THE seeds to buy.  WARNING: once you go Bigs, you cannot go back to David's sunflower seeds!<br /><br />I've given up waiting for supplies to sell on amazon and went directly to their web site: [.
4;Hard to find on the west coast.;Back East you can find these at ANY boardwalk. A few hours of skeeball and you are walking home on a summer night with these dark chocolate things reminding you of when you were a kid.
5;good eating;I have brought many items from bob red mill products ..
1;Just thrown into a box, some were broken;I have been purchasing K-Kups for over a year now and most of the time I purchase them from on-line vendors.  They are always packaged very carefully, in single layers, neatly lined up and protected by a layer of cardboard.
5;Great for training!;These are softer treats, and small. But I love them because I can cut them down even smaller for training our puppy so they last a lot longer.
5;Hodgson Mill Gluten Free Linguine;I had a very different experience with this pasta, and I wish it were still available because I would love to re-order. All 6 boxes were great.
5;Numi tea;I love the taste. Not sure yet which flavor to pick as my favorite.
5;Guilt-free treats;Both dogs love these - my anything-is-delicious-Lab and my picky no-one-knows-what-he-is little mutt. The Lab gets a whole heart at a time, the lil one gets half a heart at a time.
5;A good, spicy blend.;I purchased the 4 oz size, and it arrived with a few sample packs of other salts as well. This stuff tastes very good, and is hot, although in my opinion, it wont kill you like other ghost pepper oriented products might.
1;gross;The first thing I noticed after opening the sealed bag was a godawful smell. It really slaps you in the face.
4;Everlasting depends on the dog!;I have two dogs that both like this toy. I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.
5;Pumpkin Seeds;These Pumpkin Seeds are the quality I have grown to expect from Bob's products. This is the best price I have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis, especially in the morning with oatmeal.
1;NOT Post Fortified Oat Flakes;These Oat Bran Flakes do NOT, I repeat, do NOT taste like Post Fortified Oat Flakes. I was so hoping that they would, but alas, they do not.
4;Very good salt for a very good price;I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.
4;all-natural liquid goodness;Lickety Stik lickable pet treat from PetSafe are a hit at my house. My dog gets excitement every time I pulled it out.
4;Good for small dogs.;I have two American Eskimo dogs, and so these are good for them.  If I had larger dogs, these treats would be too small for the dog to enjoy.
5;Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!;This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding.
5;Good Graham Crackers in Better Packaging.;I have found better Graham Crackers but these are quite good and we buy them frequently. I like the new packaging since each individual package contains just enough for one time.
5;Product was xcellent...packaging was poor....;The fish were excellent, but a few cans had some dents, nothing serious but they were packed loose in a plastic bag and were pretty much free to bounce around in the box.  Like I said, the fish were great, I was a little concerned they would have an acid bite due to the mustard (I've had fish in the past with mustard, not this brand, and they were too acidic!)but these were very mild and tasty!  I enjoyed them, but remember, not everyone has the same palate.
5;Brown Sugar Substitute;I cannot find this at a local grocery store in Colorado.  I tried a sample in the mail.
3;Ingredients - added sugar?;We bought the 32 oz. vanilla extract.
5;I've created a picky eater;I picked this cat food up one day after work (mainly because Trader Joe's was next to my old office), and my cat LOVED it.  Not only does he love it, he now refuses to eat any other food.
5;Delicious!;I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty.
2;Scared our dog;We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day.  Some of the toys he loved, but this one scared him.
5;Great to add to pet food.;Helps my dog, who has a sensitive stomach -firms up her stools and adds nutrition at the same time. I add 1/4 tsp.
5;What a Find!!;I used to buy theses little gems at my grocery store but they stopped carrying them when they changes hands.  I went without, until I thought to check Amazon, and there they were!  They are tiny tablets that add a wonderfully smooth flavor to your coffee, or hot chocolate.
3;cat food byt he can;the packaging for this cat food was great, im not going to say that this stuff is amazing because in reality it not.  it like feeding your cats mcdonalds, but i have three cats and i split one can between all them as a treat they go nuts for it!!!! they are a fairly large can at 5.
4;Good coffee at good price.;This coffee is far better than what one could normally buy at this price point. Though not quite the star that some coffees costing three times the price are, it is a very good coffee value.
4;Not bad.;I love this brand and prefer them to even to other kcup brands. I am not going to spend time talking about this type of kcup.
1;Ick.  big chunks of salt.;This hazelnut crunch chocolate has big chunks of salt in it. The salt seems to be what makes it crunchy, not the hazelnuts.
5;Delicious!;This product is delicious! We are a half Indian/half American household, so we know good Indian food when we try it. The ingredients are fresh and the kit makes it easy to put together a quick meal.
5;Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats, Medium Sized,;Speaking for my furbabies, these treats are great!  I get the Cheese flavor, the dogs love them.  Terrific treats.
4;Yummy and convenient!;It tastes good for the convenience and has enough caffeine to get me through a work day.  It comes in packets that are easily split up if you are sharing, or good if you need them on-the-go.
5;Dole Mixed Fruit in Black Cherry Gel;Quick delivery. Item well-packaged and secured for mailing.
5;Wife likes it so I am happy!;I love the Keurig, it makes me feel all Star Trek. Wife and father-in-law like the decaf.
4;Solo, maybe not - but as an ingredient...;No, this pudding mix doesn't have the thicker texture of the no-bake cheesecake mix. It's cheesecake /flavor/ pudding.
3;High Quality, Didn't Agree With Dog;While this food was high quality, my dog seemed to have very loose stool.  This I can't hold the food entirely accountable for, as my dog was found to have an allergy with some ingredients.
1;RED pistachios.;I started to give these RED --- did I mention that they're RED? ---<br />pistacios four (instead of five) stars BECAUSE they are RED..
5;cheaper in bulk;This non-fat milk product is excellent.  It is easy to mix (with a mixer or blender) and tastes fine.
1;Stopped Working;Received Xmas of 06. Worked great about two times.
2;Not A Marshmallow Dip Substitute;Despite my concerns over the taste of calorie free food, I tried the chocolate dip and was amazed. Can't be eaten plain but was very good paired with other things (strawberries are great!) So, I decided to give the rest of the line a try.
5;Very good black licorice;I've gotten these and Red Vines European style licorice at different times.  These are way better.
4;Magic in a bottle;Having bought various types of vinegars hoping to find the right one but never did until now.  My local hyper market sells various brands of balsamic but some have a heft price tag, the more aged typically the more it cost.
5;Delicious!;Spicy, sweet, crunchy and healthy! They have a perfect texture. The boxes take up a bit of room (they could have used bags), but not a big deal at all.
2;Disappointing;I have been buying Starbucks for years, and it was always at least good and usually exellent. The last few orders of French Roast and Sumatra were very disappointing.
5;A great finger food;I love Salmon Pate', its great with crackers or in Salmon Crochets.  I first had this on a cruise and never forgot the great taste, its one of my favorites.
5;Fortune Cookies By the Case!;This is a fun gift to send, 96 individually wrapped La Choy Fortune Cookies with free shipping, hard to beat, and good fortunes inside, I was told.  This is a real stress reliever for an office of people.
1;You're kidding, right?!!;I saw this in my inbox and I was ready to wake the kids and alert the relatives.<br />Then I saw the price.
5;Cheapest and best quality service out there!;At about $10 for the 230 warheads itself, this product was the cheapest I could find on the internet. Not only that, but including the fast priority shipping which was about $6 (came in 3 days) the price was still under most of other similar products not including shipping! The colors were all pretty evenly dispersed (unlike the other misleading product on amazon, which only gave mostly lemon warheads) and I got 15 extra! I've only eaten a few so far but they were pretty fresh and no duds or melted ones yet.
4;Tastes good and easy to fix, but you pay for that convenience.;This is a nice, quality product.  The pasta is good quality, very tasty, and the sauce tastes good and there is plenty of it.
5;"This Drink ""Rocks""";I used to be a Sugar Free Red bull addict.  Once I had Diet Rock Star, I converted.
3;Thought it was a 5 oz can, instead a 3 oz can;I like Hill's Science Diet for my cat.  He enjoys it, and it helps him stay trim.
1;Does Not Deter Racoons;I live in the country and have several Bluebird and Tree Swallow Houses mounted on 6 foot poles scattered about.  Racoon(s) began raiding the nests.
5;Brilliant!;To those of you whinging about the occasional drip down the sides. Get over it! This is the only product on the market that provides the aeration that a quality red wine needs to taste divine.
1;Burgess Seed Co. dba directgardening.com;"I highly recommend folks AVOID Burgess Seed and Directgardening.com at all costs!  They have been charging orders on credit cards and NOT filling them!!!  They send form letters to avoid refunds and you get the ""talk to the hand"" if you get through to their poor customer service."
5;Great Product, Lousy Price;This is way too expensive to buy from Amazon. However, Coke Zero is the best tasting cola alternative on the market today.
3;good coffee;If you like Starbucks, you will love Illy. :) Much better aroma, but similar style (more-or-less over-burnt).
5;Great hard to find coffee.;Grocery stores carry items you try and fall in love with..
5;Great taste!;I order this for my office and everyone seems to love it. After much taste testing, we chose Jack Links for the great taste, variety, and value.
5;Addictive!;We've been looking for almonds that were raw and not seasoned
5;Extraordinary;This is my favorite dark roast, maybe my favorite all time.  Nice rich flavor without bitterness.
5;Outstanding tasty product;Presentation is yous perfect and product really fresh, tea bags came inside individualized plasticized aluminum bag making them to be ever-fresh. I will buy other kind of teas from this seller, hopefully they must be as excellent as the Earl Grey one.
1;Organic tomatoes in a BPA lined can! Why?!;I used to buy two cans of this sauce every week because it was affordable, tastes good and organically grown. I was shocked when I learned that the cans are lined with Bisphenol A (BPA)! I called the company directly and they confirmed this.
5;Nice Morning Cup;I found the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee to be full bodied and rich. Pleas take the other reviews for what they are worth.
4;Good But Subtle Chocolate Flavoring - Recommended;"Torani Sugar Free Chocolate Flavoring has a fairly subtle flavor that provides a nice ""hint"" of chocolate to coffee, milk, and baked goods. Being diabetic, I am always looking for good tasting, low carb things."
5;Best spiced apple cider for Keurig Yum!;All of us love this hot apple cider brewed on a 10 oz setting with a cinnamon stick or two in the cup.  It tastes like hot apple cider and has 0 calories, great for diabetics, and it has Vitamin C.
5;I love these cashews! Great flavor!;I can easily finish a bag of these cashews in one sitting. The cashews are slightly glazed and sweet with a great crunchy texture.
3;Not really an assortment;I was really looking forward to trying different brands and flavors of coffee but this assortment was 90% Green Mountain and 75% some type of vanilla.  It included 4 Blueberry (haven't tried that yet but not really happy about it).
5;Great Taste, High Price on Amazon!;Overall, this product is excellent and is the best tasting cereal bar avaiable in my opinion.  However, at Walmart, you can buy 12 boxes of the 6-pack for a total of $27.
5;Great on salads!!;I adore this cereal, especially with fruit.  Granted, it's no Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but what is?  The best way to eat this cereal is sprinkled (generously) in a salad.
1;Not teriyaki as I like it;For some reason the taste of this is all off for me. I love teriyaki and order it in any form when out.
4;Havahart Deer Off- deer, rabbitt and squirrel repellant;We used this spray on the pumpkins that we had outside. In years past the squirrels would chew into the pumpkins to get to the seeds.
5;A good buy;When these came, they were super fresh and tasty. Even after a few weeks, they still are good quality and I enjoy eating them.
4;Delicious AND healthy;This is one of my favorite healthy cereals.  It has a good mix of textures and the flavors are sweet and indulgent.
5;An excellent Greek EVOO;What a wonderful surprise.  Not having a good memory of EVOO during visits to Greece, I was totally surprised by the fruity, complex taste of this oil based on the Koroneiki olive.
4;Great Cat Food;The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is the price.  Best organic cat food you can buy, but it IS very pricey.
1;I dunno: Barley Malt!;Barley malt?  These guys are friends from grade school when they were spitballing each other, not reading ingredients lists, of gluten-free products because they've added barley malt..
5;The same great flavor, just packaged in bulk;Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.
1;No bargain;I agree with the first reviewer.  I can get the same 12-pack from a local grocery for under $3.
5;Perfect protein shake for women!;Orgain makes the best protein shake I have ever had.  Not only does it taste better than ALL other protein shakes (and I am picky!), but it is made from the best possible ingredients.
5;Best-tasting larabars;"This is our favorite flavor, we order in bulk from Amazon instead of paying a lot more at our local grocery store.  We are doing the paleo diet and these are great ""sweet"" tasting snacks."
1;Watch expiration dates!1;1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats.
5;cooks well, tastes great;My wife has Celiacs and as a result I have been on a quest to find a pasta that she can eat and I enjoy. While gluten free will never be like semolina pasta, this comes really close.
5;Chai tea;Love,love this product. I enjoy a cup every afternoon.
4;Tasty, but not all kids like it....;I think it's great (for instant Mac & cheese, that is) BUT kids are picky eaters.  Our oldest loves it but for whatever reason our second oldest can't stand it.
4;Good, but is chunky;Got this for my daughter (9month old), she seems to like it but she finds it hard to chew on the chunky pasta pieces. No complains.
5;Blown out of proportion;This was just the thing I was looking for, to make a special gift for that special someone.  It may sound silly, but my fiance goes thru gum like there's no tomorrow.
5;This is the future;"Hemp is the future with so many benefits exceeding not only milk(where you get a product from a animal that typically lives 25 yrs but in production farms only 5 because of the high amounts of constant impregnating and milking which infects,weakens the cows utters( ""pus"" is a problem) which then need harmful antibiotics. plus there giving hormones to produce more milk and they leave a huge carbon(methane bad) imprint on the planet ,yeah we don't like to look at how we really get our food."
5;Outstanding;I just tried this ginger beer at a Jamaican restaurant in San Diego, CA and it is magnificent. It makes a warm burn in your throat that is lovely and enjoyable.
1;Cookies delicious;
5;AMAZING!!!;"These uber-healthy bars do the trick whenever I have a chocolate craving. I try my best to eat ""whole food"" and this becomes difficult when I am craving something sweet."
1;Product not suitable for vegans;I researched some of the ingredients on this item and i found that powdered bonito is a fish derivative however the ingedients listed on the page here only says powdered bonito but on the actual package it says powdered bonito(fish).I think the people who sell this item should modify the ingredient listing on this page.
1;Love the product - question the price;I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.
5;Pina Colada Tea;Very tasty tea. Almost like a snack you can eat out of the bag but DON'T.
5;good stuff;It's a big bag of dog food, just like it says.  My dog was on the Prescription Diet for sensitive stomachs, but she has adjusted to this food pretty well and it is easier to get (doesn't require a trip to the vet) and cheaper.
5;""" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""";I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician.
5;Smokehouse Almonds;Excellent flavor which we can find no where around us locally.  Ate these as children and enjoyed them so much.
5;Great crunch;These Pop Chips are a great snack. The perfect size portion, 100 calories, and very tasty.
5;Great product--Great value;I have been searching for a reasonably priced arborio rice. Locally my choices were only imported Italian versions.
5;not too strong not too weak;What can I say except the coffee is not too strong and not too weak. No Bitterness.
5;My new favorite!;Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.
3;its ok;i bought one of these bottles because i wanted to try it out first before i got alot of them. i tryed half a bottle since i didnt want to be all hiped up.
2;Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder;As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.
5;I'd give Pill Pockets six stars if I could;These pill pockets are fabulous. You can easily mold them tightly around a capsule (or pill) and so administering medication to a dog is a snap.
5;Huge hit with cats and dogs.;Freeze Dried Treats were a huge hit in my house!  My dog absolutely loved them, and she's a dog who isn't all that into food.  I especially like that since they are dry you can stuff them in a kong without getting the kong stuck with nasty food you can't clean out.
4;Neat and tidy tea mug infuser;I have recently been brewing my own herbal blend infusions, not actually tea, and have found this mug to fit my needs.  The mug is simple and streamlined, and very easy to use.
4;Clean tasting water, convenient bottle size;I found this to be a great tasting water. It's crisp, clean and has a smooth, refreshing taste to it.
3;It's alright;It smells nice, and has a thick consistency, but rather than call it a scrub, I'd call it a cleanser
5;My favorite coffee!;And I make it in my favorite coffee maker ..
4;Unique, Salty, and Powerful;This stuff has a unique flavor that defies comparison.  It's salty with a hint of something else not entirely unlike beef flavor.
1;Fiji water is awesome but...;I think it might be an error, but believe me 12 bottles of .5 liter Fiji Water is nowhere near 65 dollars.
5;Favorite Chebe Product;"I love the taste and texture. One of the reviewers rightly said ""it does not rise""."
5;Gopher Hunter;Gophers were ruining my yard. Actually my dogs were ruining it chasing the gophers.
5;Tasty flavored decaf;This is by far the best flavored decaf I've ever drank. The smell and flavor are delicious without the chemical or burnt taste some decafs have.
5;Horsetail Grass Tea;Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.
5;Excellent medium roast;Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste..
4;Firm quality chip;Just got this order and it is ok. A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me, if it is there.
5;Good variety of chiles;This pack gives you a nice variety of chiles to use in cooking (some of which are hard to find locally), and the amount that you get for the price is a good deal.  I have only used one variety so far and really enjoyed the recipe, but I'm sure I will find other uses.
3;Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment;I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.
4;Solid;This kind doesn't taste as good as the original Irish oats, but who has 30 minutes to wait around in the morning?  All you do is measure out a 2:1 water-to-oat ratio in a bowl and microwave it for 2 minutes.  Easy, simple, and ready to go.
1;waste of money;there is not enough pressure on it and it gives weak espresso looks like a watery coffee..
5;Tastes great and fights cavities;I ordered this gum because my dentist suggested I chew gum with xylitol. The price was great for this gum.
5;Great product at a great price;Since there is a national shortage of canned pumpkin, I was very happy to find an online source for this product. Our dog needs the pumpkin to keep her digestive tract regular and she loves it.
4;Not as good as the almond coconut;I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.
4;such a nice product...;I rarely, if ever review products, but when I put one of these in my mouth, I thought I died and went to heaven. If you like white chocolate, these were made for you.
4;Not much flavor but ok;Krusteaz has been my favorite pancake mix for years.  My husband likes fluffy pancakes though and seeing that other reviewers said these were fluffy and delicious, I decided to give it a try.
1;AWFUL!;Sorry, but I really thought these were awful.  My husband didn't like them either and he's really into natural foods.
2;No thanks;"First, the broccoli sucks.  I have seen much better ""broccoli"" in packaged foods."
2;A good deal?;I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.
4;Great dog treats;These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session.
5;Mimicreme 16 oz;Mimicreme is great. Bought it at a health food store in the spring.
5;Virgin Coconut Oil Softgels.;I LOVE these softgels and this name brand. I will never be without these again.
5;Great!;I love these! The price is VERY good..
5;Best Espresso By Far!!!;The tastiest espresso is yielded from Crema E Gusto. A nice chocolate undertone.
4;Makes a good pineapple upside down cake with minor adjustments;Thank you Betty Crocker!  This is a very good cake mix for those who aren't comfortable cooking from scratch. Those whose reviews include concerns over texture have a point.
1;These noodles are great, but not from Amazon.;I've had these noodles many, many times. From grocery stores, and even a small convenience store on my college campus.
5;Outrageously Good!;I tried this around Christmas time. It is so good,I find myself smacking my lips to get the last of the taste off.
5;Decaf Earl Grey Tea;Great price for a great tea.  To have the ability to enjoy my decaffeinated tea with the convenience of my Keurig is one of life's greatest pleasures.
4;Does a good job;This thing is easy to use and does its job without fuss.  The handle has very good grip.
5;This week on Intervention:;My wife Maki and I recently vacationed in Salt Lake City and found there a small Japanese grocery store.  While perusing, we loaded up on candies and snacks for the long drive back to Montana the following day.
3;K-cup coffee sampler;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great Gift;This is the second time I have purchased this fruit of the month club for a gift to my Mom.  My Mom looks forward to every month receiving a different fruit.
5;Delicious!;Not only does this pasta taste great, but it takes not time at all to cook and matches well with any sauce you pair it with. So far I have tried alfredo, tomato sauce and even spaghetti carbonara and they all taste wonderful.
5;A difference I can see.;I recently switched to this food for my three dogs, an eight year old chocolate Lab, a ten year old miniature Dachshund and a one year old miniature Chihuahua. They all like it.
5;Good for you Flaxseed;I love the Bob's Red Mill products and the flaxseed Meal is great!  I use it on my cereal and in baking recipes.  It is really nutritious and has a slight nutty delicious taste.
2;Ugh.;I've always loved Chips Ahoy cookies, so I was excited to try the new Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Chocofudge..
5;Chow chow;This Chow chow has an amazing flavor, I am going to purchase some more.  I want to try the hot also.
5;Excellent smooth, light coffee.  Good anytime.;Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.
5;This stuff is hot!;I first bought this about 15 years ago in a spice store, and it is exactly as the name implies. If you like hot sauce, this has to be in your fridge.
5;Pumpkin Bar;This product is amazing!!!  I bought 5 of them just because it is so hard to find it in supermarkets.  We had a large party, with a ton of food, but these pumpkin bars were the clear favorites of our guests.
3;Sunflower Oil and Elderberry Juice!;The dried cranberries sent to me are of the Eldeberry Juice variety (also have sugar, Sunflower oil and citric acid). These are stickier than the regular kind, which contain just cranberries and sugar.
5;13 month old loves it !;My son loves chick chick. This is the only baby food he will still eat.
3;Popchip fail;These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer.
5;Very good mix...;My husband ordered this after reading all the good reviews it had. He was tired of the bland flavor of Bisquick waffles.
4;JUST ate it!;"Overall good It has a creamy green tint to it, The first bit i was thinking ""i need salt"" but i ate it all and NOW feeling satisified! For it being organic & salt free i am suprised how yummy it really was. I would suggest this soup to anyone."
5;Very healthy, rich, and good;We saw these on sale at Publix and they are very rich in taste. Particularly this fusion.
5;My personal fave;My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee.  To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.
1;Not special at all;This dark chocolate is virtually inedible. It's much too sweet and barely tastes of chocolate at all.
5;FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!;We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.
5;If you like Lifesavers;Then you've noticed that they aren't that common in the stores any more. I can never find the Tropical Fruits and they're my favorite.
3;It Is OK;"MIO ""Mango Peach"" has good sweetness but an odd flavor that makes it my least favorite of this brand. MIO is intended to be added to water and can be mixed ""to taste"", I like four short squirts into a 12oz water bottle."
1;GROSS!!!;I can't believe I actually paid money for this stuff. It's gritty, tastes NOTHING like cheese in the least, and no one in our family of 4 ate more than one bite.
5;Great product;Roland Kosher anchovies in olive oil from Spain are a great buy of a really high quality fish product. The reviewer who said they are high in Sodium apparently hasn't used processed anchovies before- these are no more saltier then other canned anchovies in oil and much less then anchovies packed in salt.
5;great substitute for my favorite potato chip;"just a quick note to let people know this is an excellent tasting, low calorie chip and love ordering these individual sized bags. I'm a 10-year plus Weight Watcher still maintaining my weight loss, and thanks to products like these that do not taste at all like ""diet"" food, I can enjoy all my cravings."
5;A Perfect Fit.;I needed, nondescript, chocolate gold coins for my pirate party on Halloween night.  These were perfect!  I ordered three times what I actually needed, and so used some as Thank You gifts for people who assisted with the party and the rest made an evening of Poker a lot more interesting.
5;Make mine mint!;I love mint-anything -- and I definitely love mint and chocolate together. So I was really looking forward to trying this one, having also enjoyed various varieties of similar coffee mixes over the years.
1;Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.;My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it.
1;Oops! My mistake: CONTAINS BPA! Goodbye to this product!;UPDATE: BUT 5 stars GO TO AMAZON WHO ISSUED A CREDIT FOR MY LAST ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT! GOOD WORK AND THANK YOU AMAZON, I AM IMPRESSED!!! -Mo<br />..
4;Good Sugar Free Cookies - Recommended;"I have tried several types of Murray sugar free cookies and can say that they have all been good and the ""Fudge Dipped Mint Cookies"" are no exception. These are not quite as good as regular cookies but, being diabetic friendly, are a good alternative."
2;Not enough in the box;I felt ripped off.  Open the big box, and there are six medium sized boxes.
5;Pleased Subscriber;I started adding chia seeds to my diet about 18 months ago.  I have tried various brands and like the Navitas Naturals brand the best of the 4 or 5 brands I have tried.
4;Tastes ok, good for ya!;This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one.
4;Great tasting coffee;My husband and I love this coffee it has a nice smooth taste.<br /><br />Sets our morning off to a good start even though it is D-caf<br /><br />Delivery was fine, no problems at all.
5;Carrie;This received bad reviews however i thought it tasted great. You definately could taste the carmel apple.
5;Our Top Choice Coffee;When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months.
5;Great Tea;I never drank Hibiscus tea before. i drink it daily now.
1;DO NOT BUY;Smells horrible and tasks wrotten.  Tried four different cans all the same.
1;Great taste - but honestly what goes inside ?  read on ...;I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.
1;flavorless, odorless;Unless you like flavorless, truck stop style coffee do not order.  Beans have an oily appearance but have no aroma even after grinding.
5;Meiji Choco Macadamia;These were absouluty delicious.  American chocolates have alot more parrafin or other substance that is just not chocolate leaving the mushy or waxy tasting and these are from Japan and have great texture and taste far superior than anything here in the states.
5;Tasty source of protein;I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful.
5;clasyk1;Great product. Loved it! Tried it for the 1st time based on reviews.
5;A perfect blend!;This is my favorite ESE pod at an acceptable price.  The Lucaffe brand is my favorite.
4;Jasmine pearls tea!;As an avid tea drinker of jasmine pearls green tea, this product is a great value.  The tea has a nice flavor and can be steeped for 2-3 cups of tea.
3;Unsatisfied;Got it today and tried it but the color doesn't seem to flow continuously. Maybe i received a defective product, idk.
5;Toddler loves these!;My son is A very picky eater. To help him with his fruits and veggies intake, I feed him these and the happy toddler brand packets.
5;Great find on Amazon;I have been buying this product in Irvine, California.<br />It is a wonderful product.
5;Diet Cola Syrup;Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though.
5;A New Favorite!;Originally I bought this product as something new to try from Whole Foods.  Once I used it for tacos I had to buy more.
3;Tasty - But Only If You Like a Chunky Drink;This is a tasty tea, but I think solids within your liquids are a personal preference, and I tend to prefer drinks without pulp.  Otherwise, it is a good tasting beverage (a little high in calories for me as I tend to choose lower calorie teas).
5;Really Delicious. I Love the Smokehouse Flavor!;"I've had ""Blue Diamond' almonds on many occasions, of course. It's a rather famous brand."
1;Not Worth the Money;The only great thing I can say about this product is that the tins are nice. The tea inside is about as low quality as you can get.
3;Geber Barley Cereal;the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson.  It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.
4;Pretty Good;This item didnt stain even after using it over and over to make overnight iced coffee. It strains very fine grounds.
2;Awful;I'm a huge fan of Newman's salad dressings, but this flavor was so bad that I had to return it.  It smells like lemon-scented furniture polish, and tastes like lime-flavored Crystal Light drink mix -- chemical-tasting and completely overpowering.
5;Wonderful honey - exceeded expectations!;I am very pleased with this honey.  The bottles arrived well packaged, undamaged and not leaking.
2;A great fly attractant;I picked this dog food knowing it has predominantly corn in it. Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product, corn gluten, wheat flour are the four main ingredients.
2;"Not that ""pure"" for me";I dont know what kind of coconut they use for this, the sour taste keeps reminding me that is not what natural and fine coconut water tastes like. I even doubt if the water has turned bad during the transportion under this hot weather.
5;K cup green tea;Product was as described. The green tea flavor is okay, it can be a bit strong unless you prefer stronger flavors.
4;great quality, crappy price;These gummy snacks are great, but there is very little in each box, so the price is pretty high for the amount you get.<br />There are very few vegetarian friendly gummy snacks out there, and this is one of the best I've had.
4;not hot, but sure is good!;This item is really not very hot. Not really.
3;This Coffee is Not Bad;"This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of ""pods"" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices."
5;perfect for small dog;Convenience size container. Food is always fresh.
5;I will be back for more...;I purchased this candy, on vacation, at a candy store in Michigan at the cost of $9.89 per pound plus tax.
1;Tuna oil?;If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.
5;O. M. G.;My cousin brought some back from Germany and I had a bar.  It's ruined me on other chocolate for the rest of my life.
1;Not Pleasant;I ordered this off of Amazon because I had never tried caviar before, it arrived & the whole family tried it - it was not good - we didn't even finish the jar. I thought maybe it was because I had never tried caviar before, but I just tried fresher caviar last week and realized I love caviar - this stuff is just gross.
4;Excuse me, would you like a blueberry muffin with your coffee?;"Tastes like Blueberry muffin and coffee without the muffin. My opinion is that its better than <a href=""http://www."
1;DON'T BUY! Don't waste your money!!!;This is the worst $5 I have ever spent. If I could give it less than a star I would.
4;All Day Volume.  Lightly Scented.  Performance on Par with Others in Its Category.;Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner is lightly scented, goes on thick & takes a little work to rinse out.  It claims to add all day volume to your hair.
1;terrible cookies;I've eaten a lot of different gluten free cookies and these are by far one of the worst. The dough part has NO flavor.
5;Wheat Free Alternative;This pasta is a wonderful wheat free alternative! It needs to be watched as the last few moments of cooking can take it from just right to a tad mushy.  I cook in-beweetn 7-8 minutes.
5;Great product.;Great product.  As described and delivered promptly.
1;Not Baked?;The cookies looked and tasted as if they were either underbaked, or not baked at all. They would also benefit from a touch of stevia and more dry fruit.
5;LOVE this stuff!;"I just LOVE this coffee!  It's just so light, not heavy and ""burned"" like a lot of morning coffees, but it has all the caffeine that you're accustomed to for morning.  I have always loved Caribou's coffees WAY over Starbuck's (Starbuck's is AWESOME for growing roses, however), and this one is just perfect for us."
5;Great product;Love the ingredient list. Checked at all the stores in my area and could not get this item at all, much less at the price I got if for here.
5;Best Ramen Ever;We have been buying this Ramen for years whenever we can find it at the local grocery. It was so great to get it in bulk from Amazon.
5;I had to improvise but I LOVED it;By improvising I mean that I have no coffeemaker other than my humble gold mesh basket that fits into a cup. So I put the pod into the bottom of the basket, added a little water to pre-prime it -- and then added hot water.
1;Just Terrible.;We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.
5;Surprisingly delicious!;"Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand ""Popchips"", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn."
5;GREAT BULK PRICE;JELLO IS JELLO BUT WHO WANTS TO PAY 1.19 PER PKG AT SAF*WAY---GET IT DELIVERED ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS DEPENDING ON USE.
5;The Best Cookie I've Had (Oh, and it's Gluten-Free!);This product is a celiac's dream!  Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.
5;Super fruit flavors.;This tea is great for anyone who likes a little fruity flavor in their tea. Needs no sweetener.
5;Great Coffee;Great coffee.  I use it on my Francis, Francis.
5;This is my new favorite energy snack;I found a 9oz version of Ann's House Healthy Energy Blend. I really liked it and wanted to purchase more, but wasn't sure what store I found it in.
5;My Dog's Favorite Treat!;If I lay out a group of treats in a row, these are the first she goes for. They smell like the fry vat at a fast food joint which is probably like true and real love to my little dog.
5;Very very good coffee;"I had never of this source but the reviews (positive) are right and this coffee is a ""keeper"". The coffee is bold are really a ""kick a__"" blend at a good price for K-cup coffee."
3;The brown rice is just fine, but overpriced;I don't have a problem with the brown rice (I prefer it, even) and am a little mystified to why so many people seem to hate it, but I do agree that they should have replaced the malt flavoring with something else, because this variety is a little too plain-tasting. Not at all bad though, and it's nice to be able to eat Rice Krispies again - although I might add that it's ridiculous that it took so long for a cereal made of *RICE* to go gluten free.
5;Great for kids and parents too!;Our family is addicted to it! Kids faves are Vanilla and sometimes Chocolate. We mix this powder with Pure Silk Coconut/Almond Milk every morning and have absolutely no fight for breakfast.
4;Came through in a pinch.;My thanks to this company for getting me exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner. The product was exactly what I was hoping it would be and much better tasting than I was expecting.
2;Better'n Not;You could tell this pb had most of the fat taken out that makes pb so good. Probably will not order the original again.
3;not as great as caramel;This flavor is not as good as the caramel. It is more of a dark chocolate flavor, not so sweet and sometimes I forget about the raspberry while trying to balance the chocolate and sweetness.
5;Addictive;A couple of years ago, my Wal-Mart carried large bags of these for a short time and I was instantly hooked but when they stopped, I couldn't get them without ordering directly from Herr's site which was a bit of a hassle. Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.
5;delicious;I was pleasantly surprised at how good this granola was.  The chocolate was a nice flavor, not too sweet.
4;BEWARE NO NIPPLES;Similac is terrific (I was a Similac baby myself), and I bought this pack as an emergency supply to have handy after learning about the option through my hodpital (which used these pre-filled bottles in the nursery).  But -- lo and behold -- it doesn't come with nipples!  And Similac doesn't even appear to market them.
5;the best coffee ever;this is such a smooth, flavorful coffee!  not too dark, but not weak at all.  it is also not bitter.
5;great find;I have been looking for sweetner tablets and could not find them in store.  Go to amazon, where you can find anything.
5;Excellent quality;This most definitely is a green tea of superior quality. It is economical in that its yield is a bit stronger than average - one needn't double up bags to get a decent flavour.
4;Worth the expensive price;I bought this product because I needed freezer trays and was trying to use up the remainder of a gift card I had. Im glad that I had the gift card to go towards this product because I know that it is very expensive.
5;Wow...I can't believe the quality;At first I wasn't sure but I figured, at the price i'd give it a try.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality of this coffee.
1;Cheese not tasty.;I love the regular Annie's Rice Mac and Cheese, Love. This stuff tastes totally artificial.
5;As far as diet foods go, it's definitely 5 star!;We received a sampler package from Amazon that had several flavors..
5;Srirach cool stuff for making spicy mayo.;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great product;Tried one bag to test out and liked them enough to order three more bags.  I make eskate (sp?) using chia, water, and lime juice and I also have been putting them into homemade peanutbutter and oatmeal energy bars.
5;Skinny, Picky Poodle has gained a pound on this stuff;I was able to add a full pound to my skinny, 15yr old toy poodle with this.  He loves it and looks forward to dinner again.
5;The best true British tea!;PG Tips Tea<br />This is by far the best tea I have ever had, and I drink gallons of tea!  I was introduced to it by my sister-in-law, who hails from Great Britain.  She said it was all she ever drank there, but could not find it here.
5;Childhood favorite!;I loved Zotz as a kid. You get 48 packs, which has 4 pieces, so you end up with 192 Zotz.
5;add a few things and it is excellent;We add a little chicken, corn and cheese to the soup and it is delicious. One of our favorites of the packaged soups.
5;Underrated / Highly Comparable to PG Tips;"I recently discovered Lifeboat Tea at a ""foodie"" (for lack of a better term) store.  Great flavor + strength."
2;"The things we do for ""health""...";"I think this stuff is disgusting. I have been hearing about the ""wonderfulness"" of Kombucha and instead of getting a can from my local health food store, I bought a case thinking I was saving a lot of money."
5;Great shopping experience!;Vendor carried my hard-to-find products at competitive prices.  Super fast shipment, very careful packing.
5;Love it;I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.
4;Black Tiger Holds Up;I was looking to replace my depleted store of Coffee People Jet Fuel, but it was back ordered.  One of the reviewers suggested that Black Tiger was a similar cup of coffee, so I bit.
5;Great for small dogs--one pouch a day;I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can.
5;Good food;We have always tried to keep away from by-products and certain ingredients in pet food, so our pets would be healthier. We feel this is a good food and it is affordable and more easily available than some of the more expensive ones.
5;love this stuff;found this stuff at a health foods store first but it was much cheaper on amazon.  short delivery time.
5;Mmmmmmm,  popcorn!;Great popcorn!  I'm a repeat buyer too.  One pack makes just a teeny bit more than my Whirly Pop can hold with the lid closed.
5;Great Taste;I really like this Pasta. I actually like it better then any other pasta I can get right now.
4;Tasty;Good sampler. Only enough for perhaps 3-4 cups of coffee per bottle.
1;Only buy if you love ORANGE tea;Chocolate?  The strongest flavor of this tea - it's actually quite overwhelming - is ORANGE.  It seems to be of good quality so if you like strong ORANGE tea, then this is for you.
4;tasty, lightly carbonated, good alternative for soda-pop;If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.
1;Ridiculous price;The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.
5;A Traditional European Treat;I used to purchase this all the time during the holidays in specialty shops at the malls and other places. This is not your typical fruitcake that everyone hates.
4;Great, but 11 of the 12 bags came.;These pretzels are very tasty when you crave a salty, mild cheddar cheese flavor. They are crunchy and hard, which I love.
4;Mmmm mmm good;If you have been out to Philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal. They are organic and made of honey.
2;hmmm...not what I expected;I love KC Masterpiece BBQ sauces, but I'm not impressed with this marinade.  Perhaps I'm not sure exactly how to use it.
2;Just put some cinnamon in your coffee;Not a favorite of mine, but I don't really like cinnamon in my coffee.  I purchased a Donut House variety pack and this came in the box.
4;Tasty snack;Really like the inclusion of rolled oats. No artificial preservatives or flavors.
5;Delicious;Being allergic to all other tree nuts as well as peanuts, this snack bar with macadamia nuts and mango is fantastic.  The macadamia gives it a nice crunchy texture without being too hard.
4;Good, not Great;This is good, but not great.  Made with Splenda/sucrolose.
5;Positively delicious!;Add a little of this syrup to ice water and you get a fantastic refreshing drink in the summer.  Incidentally, the 0% sugar version is just as delicious!  Growing up in France, I spent many afternoons sitting at cafes sipping this mint drink.
1;Cat's Unhappy;I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food.
5;Greenies;This product is just what we wanted. Doggie loves them,and I can hardly believe how fast they got here.
5;The Best!;It took them a while to arrive but when they got here they were worth waiting for. These were the absolute best nuts around.
5;awesome popcorn;we just purchased a movie theater style popcorn maker.  We used the basic oil and popcorn but just didn't get the movie theater taste that we were looking for.
4;Misinformation in description;The water is very good, though I agree with other reviews that the price is high and a different variety of flavors would be welcome. However, the description of the product says there are twelve 16-ounce bottles, which is correct, but the breakdown given indicates it comes with 4 each of the four flavors instead of 3 each.
5;Great for cats with allergies!;I bought this cat food for a cat that has a chicken allergy.  This brand cat food along with the green pea and duck are the only type cat food that he can keep down without vomiting.
5;the best decaf;We have to serve decaffinated coffee in our home, and when we discovered Seattle's Best Decaf, we were delighted. It is tasty and has an honest-to-goodness coffee flavor.
5;Finally, a chocolate bar I can love!;After searching hard for a white chocolate, sugar-free bar I can enjoy without concern regarding caffeine or theobromine, I have found it in this bar from Ross Chocolates.  It is even better when placed in the refrigerator to cool.
1;Can't get the taste out of my mouth;"I don't do very many reviews of products, but I had to for this to try and spare others like me. This is one of the most repulsive, vile and sickening ""food"" products I have ever had."
5;Delicious Alternative to Sugar;If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.
5;Absolutely the best;As a huge hot sauce fan, this is my absolute favorite and I cannot ever find the Hot Salsa Brava in stores.<br /><br />I'm so glad Amazon allows me to order cases of this, I can use a half bottle in a sitting, EASILY.
5;Great Quality Economical Health Food;The 5 pound bag I purchased, I divided into one pound containers and stored in the frig.  The quality is no different from the smaller bags, (all the products I have tried seem to be identical to me in terms of shells/seeds).
5;for gum chewers;this gum fits the bill: it has great flavor and it's good for your teeth.  perfect for freshening your breath too.
5;Amazing peanut butter and chocolate!!!;this product lived up to my expectations.  the shipment was fast, but the product is amazing.
5;Great flavor and value.;This teriyaki is great. I love the chew style, it is good for work meetings and the like.
5;Snacks without milk - Hooray !! Delicious Crunchy Snack;Y U M These are AWESOME.  BUY THEM!<br />Seriously, if you are looking for crunchy wheat crackers, buy these.
5;Best value and flavor;Fantastic! Spices are fresh and full of flavor. Arrived intact and on time.
3;I like old school cocoa much better;I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.
4;Husband Likes This Okay;We have found another that he likes better, but my husband says this is a fairly good coffee.  I drink Decaf and he drinks the regular, so I have to go by what he says about the regular coffees.
4;Absolutely delicious;I absolutely love banana nut bread but I rarely get the chance to make it not to mention all of the needless calories that go into homemade banana nut bread. This is only a fraction of the calories not to mention it tastes just like banana nut bread! It's a great snack on the go.
5;Excellent;These are the best flavor chips, my daughter and I love these, taste like real bacon. Also they arrived quickly especially considering they shipped from england to california usa.
5;Xlear XyloSweet Xylitol Sweetener, 3lb bag;no after taste and use it for every thing that needs regular sugar  and it taste good. I am diabetic so I am happy that I have found this wonderful product.
5;Awesome;If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.
5;Wholesome snack!;This is a great tasting and wholesome snack.  The quality is excellent.
3;****WARNING****;"If you have a ""gulper"" please be VERY careful with this product!!!  Please supervise your pets with this treat, as the pieces are VERY small and I can see may present a choking hazard or cause internal blockage for some dogs.  I have a 14lb pooch who is a self regulator (ie."
1;"Who expected to find milk products in ""nutritional yeast""?";TwinLab super rich yeast had RAVING fan reviews
5;Health Express All Natural 1 Net Carb Flax Seed Bread (pack of 3 loaves);That Flax seed bread is very good.  It is the best I have tasted yet, of all the bread that I have ordered.
4;Tastes okay;I ordered this because it has 2 grams of fiber in each serving, and the 10 grams of sugar each serving contains is less than the Kashi Go Lean I usually buy.<br /><br />My husband loved the nutty flavor of the Crunchy Nut.
4;Good tortillas but very delicate;Followed the instructions for homemade corn tortillas and they were better than the store versions, but extremely fragile. Be sure to add enough salt, and let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes before forming tortillas.
5;My favorite brand;I suspect most people do not use Rose Water often, but I use it at least once a week and have learned to appreciate the product quality of Al Wadi.<br /><br />Rose Water is a potent way to add a flavor many westerners are not familiar with.
5;Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.;I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day.
3;Mixed opinions;I don't typically drink coffee much these days as 1) it's a bit too messy at home to grind and brew and 2) I like those flavored sweeteners and sugar is on the *no* list these days. That said, I decided to get this when it showed up on Vine and brought it into the office to share with everyone and see what they thought - and the opinions were all over the board.
5;Great Flavor w/ Little Salt;My only complaint is that a couple bags of these outstanding pretzels arrived opened with the nuggets loosely living in the box.  The remaining bags have been delicious, with an almost nutty flavor and terrific texture.
1;Rancid product, poor processing, no quality control;"I bought Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 32 oz., 4 pack, and first of all, it took nearly two weeks for it to be shipped and arrive despite the deceptive listing stating it was ""In Stock"" at all times."
5;BEST chocolate for mochas;can't order this from Amazon for Hawaii but luckily we have it in da health food store (for albeit more $$$). Just have to state it's one of the most satisfying chocolate mixes: dark, smooth, rich.
4;Super Yummy, Not Super Healthy;Organic does not equal healthy. OK?<br /><br />That out of the way, these are super yummy.
5;great toddler breakfast;My son LOVES this oatmeal. He is 16 months and has been eating it consistently for abt 7 months.
4;Good wafers;I use wafers in a cookie recipe - been very difficult to find.  These aren't exactly like the original ones - but did work OK.
4;Multi-Use Product for Great Price;So I started using this the day I received it in the mail (fast shipping btw) and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I use this 1-2 times a day when I have a smoothie, sometimes as a little spread on my toast, and for my skin.
3;Not shrimp chips;Disappointing.  More a salty flavor than shrimp.
5;My dog loves these dental chews.;My dog loves these dental chews and they work well to keep most of the plaque off her teeth.  That saves on the vet bill.
4;Good enough;It's a fine product, good price, good taste. My only con: fruit is a bit smallish and somewhat uneven degree of dryness.
5;best feline cat food;My cats love this food.  They pick at other brands or won't eat it at all so I decided to try this brand.
1;Resist Temptation!;Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules.
1;Yuck!;Not at all what I expected, the artificial tequila flavor is so overpowering.  I love concocting drinks, using ingredients to cut sugar and I expected this to be perfect - like a well made margarita with just a small tequila flavor, the smell was very heavy even in the refrigerator after I mixed a pitcher and the flavor was just unappealing.
5;Great;I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car.
5;Natural Sprinkles Excellent;I love India Tree Products.  Their natural sprinkles are great for those with food allergies or issues with dye colors as they are all vegetable based colors.
5;Delicious;I am not a huge coffee drinker but I think this is some really good coffee. The taste is really smooth.
5;Very good cat food;I bought this cat food because I have a cat with a very sensative stomach. If he ate store brand cat food with all the junk and food coloring in it he would throw up.
4;Delicious Popcorn;The popcorn was very cheesy and tasted fresh.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves cheese popcorn.
1;Don't Bother;I had my hopes for this coffee, but it's just BAD. After one sip and threw it all up.
4;Very Good!;I love this coffee.  I can't really taste the mocha, but that doesn't really matter to me since the taste overall is so good.
5;Excellent choice for my finicky feline!;Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.
5;5 stars for the product, 0 for Amazon!!!;I had gotten the tablets from my vet and was pleased with the results my three dogs experienced. I thought I would save a couple of bucks and get the chews from Amazon.
5;Very good!;Essentially, this seems to taste very similar to the Spicy Picante variety but doesn't pack a massive kick. So, if you want the milder version I'd say this is right up your alley.
5;Luv'em;These are so good, I've started getting them automatically.  I like the original flavor, but they have a lot of others.
4;super healthy;I have to say the pizza flavor is not my favorite. They have a strong oregano flavor that is off-putting for me.
1;bstn;I bought this based on the positive reviews..
4;THree out of four cats love the bonita flakes;What's great about this brand is that the flakes are larger and easier to handle, no small crumbs that cats cannot vacuum up off the plate so easily. The treats are healthy and a simple single ingredient item, which I really like.
5;Jelly Belly's are the Best;Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.
5;Great low sodium sauce....;"Canned tomato products usually contain such high sodium content.  I was very glad to find this ""no salt added"" sauce from Muir Glen."
5;"Taste great with no ""bad"" ingredients...";A great choice for packing lunches or a quick snack on the go.  No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup either which is a tremendous plus in a packaged food.
5;Holy Moly;I just got these in the mail, and wow. I was skeptical at first, but wow they are great.
3;Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.;Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.
5;Too good to be called crackers.;These are so unbelievably good.  Addictive, even.
4;Great for that crunchy craving.;I loved the crunch in these protein supplements.  They are the lowest in calories from what I have been able to find.
4;Chewy and here is ingredients and allergen info;I wish they would list the ingredients and allergen info on the website, so here it is!<br />ALLERGEN INFO:  CONTAINS:  SOY AND MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF PEANUTS AND TREE NUTS<br />INGREDIENTS:  Sesame seeds, brown rice syrup, flaxseeds, evaporated can juice, soy crisp, crisp brown rice, inulin, vanilla extract, sunflower oil, natural lemon flavor, sea salt, turmeric for color, natural vit E for freshness, nutrition blend (calcium carbonate, ferrous sulfate, niacinamide, vitamin D3, vit B1, riboflavin, folic acid.<br />Each bar contains 130 calories of which 80 are from fat.
2;I wanted so badly to love these....;After seeing some enticing Instagram photos of friends in Brooklyn enjoying Stroopwafels atop the cups of coffee, I wanted nothing more than to create the experience for myself. I ordered two tins, and I fear that I paid over thirty bucks for.
4;Favorite Gluten Free Protien Bar I've  Found to Date;I've found protein supplementing a necessity having a diet of pretty much only veggies and fruit [and candy]. I devastated when I found out that I needed to go gluten free because it pretty much cut out any protein bar I could stand eating every day.
5;Excellent, all natural Beef Jerky!;This is excellent, tasty beef jerky! All natural with NO MSG and NO Nitrites. Not too salty and not too high in sodium.
5;The original, and still the best!;For people who are intimidated by the daunting task of making their own roux,<br />this for you.<br /><br />All you need is stock and this can of Instant Roux.
4;Roland Quinoa;Very good deal. Half the price per lb.
5;Great for baking;This can be substituted for regular molasses in any recipe.  It is also excellent for sauces and syrups.
5;Tastes great and makes for a fun night out;I am the type of person who gets tired and starts yawning when I am out at a bar..
4;Good stuff;Baby loves this.  She is 14 months old and I scoop it into her bowl and she feeds herself.
5;Great coffee;I love the taste of this coffee.Very very smooth taste with no bitter after taste.
5;Satisfying Salty Sea Snack;This salty, savory gem is so satisfying.  Packaged in an airtight container, it is as fresh and crisp as the moment it was packed at the factory.
5;Like eating a bowlful of oatmeal cookies;This is a favorite cereal for my family.  It doesn't last very long around here!  We eat it with milk or just by the handful.
3;Great treats, but smell awful!;"My dog Nova loves these treats, they are great for training. However, these and all the other ""everlasting"" products give me a very bad headache."
1;Lemon Drop Infused Cocktail Sugar;This is a horrible product.  Never before in all my born days have I seen BROWN lemon sugar.
4;Mix up your cheese-it flavors now and then.;I found these to have a good Mozzarella taste but they still retained that distinctive cheese-it cracker taste underneath which I liked. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on them so why not get a box and see for yourself? I did notice that MSG is listed in the ingredients.
4;Good, but too many nutshells in my bar.;I love Larabars and I love pistachios. Unfortunately I have found too many nutshells in my pistachio larabars.
5;Highly addictive! Great with beer;I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer.
2;Our first Banana Tree;The plants arrived well packed and on time.<br />It was planted in a patio Pot with drip line and starter Miracle  Grow pellet.
5;Nutive Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil;I wanted to try this product for mental clarity in my golden years.  I was worried what it would taste like and whether I could use it.
5;price made a difference;i love this product but like most people said, there is not much in the bag. it was on sale (free shipping) which came to 60cent a bag considering our cafe at work sells them for $1.
5;Hotter than Hades!;This stuff is super hot! That's what my family wanted though. Unlike a lot of the other hot pepper powders, this one has a great flavor that is almost fruity and smoky.
5;Not in local stores;I couldn't agree more with the other reviews for this product. This is the best Ceasar dressing and several years ago when it disappeared from the grocery store shelves around here i thought it was discontinued.
5;Perfect for training;These look and smell pretty tasty, no wonder my dog loves them. These are perfect for obedience training because you can hold a lot in your hand.
5;Cats Favorite;Natural Balance Canned Cat Food, Turkey and Giblets Recipe is our cats favorite canned food.<br />He is a very finicky eater, turning his nose at many expensive foods (canned and dry).
4;Tasty;This is a tad better to me than the Mojito flavor. It's final mix is a translucent green.
4;Great on Eggs!;I bought this years ago, after using it in a restaurant. It goes great on eggs and hash browns.
5;Wonderful product from Ohio;I have been eating Clearbrook Farms Jams for many years. They are the only comercially made jams that I have ever been able to find that are like what my mother made.
5;de-lish;I really like these. They remind me of old school granola bars.
3;Expensive;This is my favorite coffee but the cost went way up. I used to purchase it from here but then I found it cheaper here [.
5;Very Yummy!;This Chai does taste very similar to the Tastefully Simple Chai but it is a fraction of the cost.  Even children love it!  It mixes well with water, milk, soy or almond milk.
5;A Work of Art;The box containing Marley Coffee Single Serve Pods is exquisite -- a work of art. The description of the product is fascinating.
1;Sweet but packaging was a REAL bummer!;These jelly beans are my favorite. The problem was that little care was taken in packing.
5;Remarkable;A friend of mine brought this tea to work one day to share.<br /><br />I am prepared to drop coffee altogether.
5;Great Price!!!;The best price that I have seen anywhere for Good Start Soy 2. My son luvs it and I am satisfied that he is getting the extra nutrients for his growing age.
5;Organic and delicious these cherries rock!;I've been craving cherries all winter, and I am so pleased with the quality of these.  We ordered the 4-pound box and I am so glad we did.
5;Pure Awesome;I've never tasted anything so wonderful as this bar.  OMG - pure heaven.
4;Very good coconut water;I went to Hawaii last Fall to see a friend who introduced me to fresh, young, coconut water. Once I returned to the mainland I craved the flavor of coconut water.
5;The one for me!;I like strong coffee that doesn't taste like dishwater. This is the one for me.
5;Sooo Good!;As a snackaholic, I decided to give this Black Truffle & White Cheddar popcorn a try. Afterall, I figured the air popped popcorn has got to be healthier than my usual potato chips.
4;"Do NOT think ""Girl Scout Cookie"" before you try.";Overall, it's a good cookie. It's really hard to mess up chocolate and peanut butter.
5;Great tea;Great product. Used the tea for a mother- daughter holiday tea and it was a hit.
5;awesome flour;Great to use this gluten free product. It does serve the purpose.
5;good purchase;This is tasty hot and spicy. I little goes a long way.
5;Helps keep the doggies teeth clean!;I've been able to get my dogs to actually REMIND me to brush their teeth (which they don't like) because I give them one of these chews as their reward for letting me brush their teeth.  The vet said since these are enzymatic chews, it doesn't defeat the purpose of brushing their teeth.
5;amazon vs store;"Sorry, but this item is cheaper from my grocery store, which appears to be a ""first"" for Amazon.com."
5;Great Escargot Shells!;After reading the reviews, I too bought these shells for Tanganyikan cichlids, and I was very surprised and happy to see that so many people were reviewing these shells for this purpose rather than just for haute cuisine!<br /><br />Due to a childhood with French food fanatics,  I do also know that these shells would be great for use when serving escargots as well.  They arrived in great shape in terms of minimal breakage because the shells clearly belonged to sturdy, well fed and cared for snails (before the.
1;Worst! Worst! Worst!;Worst quality, All I got is powder in packets, Even thought I was not able to find how to returns. I had to throw all packs.
5;Addictive!;I love wasabi..
2;Syrupy...;This is my second try of a Switch beverage, and while I wasn't overwhelmed by the other (Watermelon/Strawberry), it wasn't bad (tasted a lot like carbonated apple juice to me). This time, while I can say that the Switch Black Cherry doesn't taste like mere apple juice (there is a tart, berry/cherry flavor), it is far, far too sweet.
5;Great food for our older dogs! They Love It!;We have a toothless older small dog and this is perfect for him to eat since he licks his food and this is healthy for him too and cheaper than the canned foods at the vets and other places! So hard to find soft/canned food that our dogs like and our other dog has upset stomack troubles and with this she doesn't get sick if she eats late in the day and loves it. Our dogs are so picky too.
5;Every body loves these treats;All of my cats love these treats.  One of them has refused every other treat we've tried (she doesn't even like most human foods), but she will eat these.
4;Great, but not perfect;"I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect ""10"" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth."
5;My favorite tea - very fragrant and spicey;I like my chai tea strong and spicey, and this tea is perfect.  I have tried other brands and this is by far my favorite.
5;Great food, well worth the money!;My dog is a cute, lovable poodle/bishon mix with sensitive skin and allergies to regular dog food. She was a picky eater and had some real problems with itching and scratching herself raw--until a few years ago when we started buying Wellness.
5;Nong Shim won a ChefsBest Award with this flavorful ramen;If your only ramen experience was a dry, tasteless brick dumped into a pot of bowling water that you purchased six for a dollar, then you are in luck. Once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl you will never go back to Nissin Top Ramen.
5;Very refreshing!;Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.
5;Once Again Sunflower Seed Butter is the absolute BEST!!!;I love this stuff!!!  It is so much better than any other brand we have tried.  Probably because it is roasted and has sugar in it, while the other brands are mostly raw.
3;A Little stale;Pkg arrived quick as does most of the items I order thru Amazon. We tryed three packs over the last week and all three tasted a little stale.
5;Another fantastic ZiwiPeak product!;It should have been no surprise to me that the ZiwiPeak canned venison is a hit with my dog as he already enjoys the ZiwiPeak Air Dried Venison Dog Food..
5;Karen;These are exceptional. I had them first at a friend's home.
5;Not just any water;Aquafina is not just any bottled water. When tried it, I wondered why it tasted better.
5;Energy boost;Bought this to give me a little extra boost during the Tough Mudder New England 2012. Worked as good as I expected.
5;Favorite coffee!;"I've tried lots of coffee pods but this is my favorite.  My ""Dunkin Donut"" friends all visit now that I serve Nantucket blend."
5;Yummy;These organic energy bites are delicious and work great.  I use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides.
5;Great taste!;We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.
1;TOO EXPENSIVE;GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS WAY OVERLY PRICED.  THE LISTED SELLING PRICE IS ALMOST $2 PER BAR.
5;Excellent!;What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.
5;Excellent weekday b'fast!;This stuff is great, half a cup, a few dried blueberries, and some water, 80 seconds in the microwave, and it's done. I eat this every morning (I eat the long cooking version on the weekends).
5;From a person with a very limited diet;I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.
5;Yummy!;Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.
5;I love squid jerky;I've been hooked on it for some time now . I first had it when I lived in pittsburgh .
5;Hooked on this!;I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.
5;Cat Love It!;I have two cats. One is extremely finicky, even with treats, but they both love this.
3;Lasts for a couple days;This was between a 3 and a 4 star review and I decided with the 3. My dogs does love these bones but once the ends are chewed off and he stripes the rest of the bone clean he wants nothing more to do with them.
5;Just like the movie theatre.;Really, there's nothing to not like. If you love the salt flavoring at your local movie theater, then this is the purchase for you.
3;I have had better Columbian;Having been spoiled drinking Gevalia Popayan beans I bought this hoping for a somewhat similar experience but unfortunately this was not the case.  It's not bad but most other Popayan beans I have purchased have been better.
5;I'm addicted!;Def a cool product. It really tastes like water! I can taste a slight mineral taste if I drive it at room temperature but if its cold it really refreshing and doesn't have a taste at all.
5;Love this stuff, but MUCH cheaper elsewhere;BOTTOM LINE:<br />I love that this oil adds HEAT AND FLAVOR to what I am cooking, without the tangy-ness of hot sauce. It is an invaluable part of my kitchen.
5;My dog loves these;These are the best dog treats on the market and my dog really loves them. They are soft and easy to break into small pieces and smell great! Not all Milo's treats are made in the USA but these are.
5;It's 8 o'clock honey !~!;"Great taste and a decent price. I really like the ""Subscribe & Save' Amazon program and utilize a lot of it."
5;Great Taste and Reasonably Priced;I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.
2;"Nectress not ""natural"" like they claim & contains refined sugar";They claim this product is all natural and made from monk fruit.  But monk fruit is not the only ingredient in Nectresse, nor is it even the primary ingredient.
5;Old Daschaund;I started noticing a difference after 48 hours in my 13 year old daschaund after starting use..
5;My dogs love 'em!;My husband and I like to buy Newman's products. We love their cookies so we thought our dogs might like them, too.
5;Good coffee, great price;When you have to drink decaf and you live in a small town with limited selection, you learn to not be especially picky.  We love our Keurig brewer, but we were paying premium prices for K-cups at our local grocery store.
5;Beautiful, gentle flavor;Lovely tea with a somewhat mild color but very elegant flavor. The Indian groceries used to carry it, but it's been tough to find lately.
5;Great Deal!  Loaded with nutrition!;So far, this price can't be beat!  These are very nutritional berries loaded with protein & vitamins..
5;This Flavor is the bomb!;ive tried nearly all the Kcup varieties after purchasing several mixed boxes of k cups.<br />this one is by far the most delicious ive ever tasted!!<br />you wouldnt even know it was decaf! lovely smokey flavor, full bodied and stands up to any plain or flavored creamer.
3;Great tea, but get it somewhere else;Not only it is cheaper if you buy via Keurig's website directly, but also the one I got off Amazon are the only tea k-cups to produce a thick layer of foam upon brewing. Come to think of it I should've returned it, but I'm already halfway through the package and there's no difference in taste.
5;Yogi Egyptian Mint Herbal Tea;I had been drinking 3-4 16 oz mugs of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea for a couple years. Six or more months ago I tried the Yogi Egyptian MINT Herbal tea, which is even better.
2;Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better;Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.
1;Not fresh.  Returned them.;The duck sticks were old, greasy and had a rank smell.  The container had a US flag sticker on the lid.
1;Does not work;Pretty simple product to use, unfortunately does not work.  Did not kill ONE weed in my yard.
5;My dog thrives on this;I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.
1;WAS choking it down better than wheat grass.;I was drinking a lot of wheat grass juice, thought I would give this a try.  It's more expensive at Whole Foods than Amazon.
5;Boost Your Health with Super Food Chia Seeds;I started changing over my eating habits by adding one new Paleo recipe a week and one new health food every two weeks. I started by adding Magnesium Citrate since I was magnesium deficient.
5;Good Stuff;Very good oatmeal.  It is microwavable.
5;Unique product, well executed;The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy.
4;Oatmeal makes for winter warmth;My kids have eaten oatmeal everyday since the weather turned cold. It puts warmth and filling breakfast into their tummies.
5;Wonderful decaf!;Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf - comes in K-Cups for Keurig brewers - this is really great coffee!  We love it.  Can't have but one or two cups of regular coffee in a day, so drink decaf in the afternoon or evening.
5;Very nice roast, strong flavor.;I liked this coffee so well that I ordered it again. The only thing disappointing to me was that the first order was packed in 2-25 pack Tully boxes whereas the second order was just all thrown together in a cardboard mailing box.
1;choking hazard - too thin and brittle;We love Earth's Best products, but these are simply too dangerous. We first tried them with our daughter at 7mo old.
5;Christmas Cheer All Year Long!;Eggnog is really a seasonal treat, and most people associate it with Christmas. For me, though, it means fall! Because as soon as it hits the shelves, I buy some.
5;Yakisoba Cheddar...Yum;No long review here.  This Yakisoba Cheddar (and Jalapeno Cheddar) leave all other mac 'n cheeses in the dust.
5;Awesome Tea;I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too.
2;NOT calorie free, contains SPLENDA;I've been searching for a natural sugar replacement and was thrilled when I discovered Ideal. I've used both the brown sugar and regular granulated.
3;OK;I love the raspberry so I thought I'd try this. Not too crazy about it.
5;Great Ceasers Ghost- These Cakes Are Great;WOW WOW WOW WOW,WOW,truly great tasting Banana Nut cake. I've been looking for this type of cake for quite awhile,just found it by accident on Amazon,glad I did,I would highly recommend these & I am going to try their Apple pies next,you won't be disappointed.
1;Terrible;Ate half of one and threw the other 23 in the garbage. Overwhelming taste/smell as if it had been soaked in sauce.
1;Don't settle for these!;Everyone I know that uses a pod brewer at home or work loves it. Fresh coffee made to order, endless variety, no waste, etc.
5;A Delicious Lifesaver;"After researching for months on possible migraine headache relief, I discovered ginger was being used as a possible treatment. Having exhausted the ""traditional"" medical route without success, I jumped in with ginger and had great results."
5;Great cinnamon tea!;This tea is exactly what I wanted - rich, warm, spicy cinnamon tea!  The tea is so well-packaged that you can't even smell the tea bag without opening the foil pouches, which means they're keeping the tea fresh.  I've brewed this tea in hot milk also for a very nice cinnamon milk tea.
1;thanks, but no thanks;"I actually ordered the two other flavors, black bean and lime, and those were awful.  So I started to think maybe the ""plain"" would be fine."
5;love this coffee.;this is the best coffee. I've tried many k cup coffees and this one is the best one that i have found so far.
4;Taste is great for summer...shipping not so much;Because the box didnt fit in my mailbox it was dropped off at my door and as soon as i opened the package the cookies were in crumbles..
4;Good, but no caffeine;This tea has a nice taste and is pretty comparable to the Foojoy Oolong, which is what I've purchased in the past. However, one thing that should be noted is that the tea is caffeine free - or at least that is what the individual tea bag wrappers state.
5;De-lish.;I'm not sure what sort of magic Maxwell House has captured here, but this product completely surpassed my and my wife's expectations.  (It probably helps to have low expectations!)  We weren't hoping for anything close to coffee house quality, but I dare say that when mixed correctly, this latte surpasses the beverages one gets out of the machine at the local gas station.
5;The best tea ever!;I have been drinking this tea for about 6 years. I drink nothing else but an occasional water.
5;Perfect for a student!;I am so grateful Starbucks started making ready brew. It tastes amazing and I carry them everywhere.
5;bourvita;The handling of the order was so superb. The order was delivered well ahead of time.
5;yummy;These are good beans. Not shriveled.
5;Great for travel!;My daughter really loves puffs! The strawberry ones have more flavor than the sweet potato ones, but she likes both. We haven't yet tried other flavors.
5;Good Cat Food;This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it.
5;Comes out great using a bread machine;I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect. The dough was much wetter than regular bread (more like a thick batter), and at first I thought I must have made a mistake when I measured the other ingredients.
4;Speedy delivery and fair prices.;This product showed up in days, and met all my expectations.  Still trying to find out if natural remedies really help though.
2;lemon cookies;Love Anna's cookies but ordered this many did not work. The last six boxes even though they had previously been unopen began to loose the lemon flavor and the last four boxes the cookies became limp.
5;Love this Coffee;Great tasting Coffee at a great price and fast shipping with Amazon Prime.  Would highly recommend this coffee.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;Love it! Hard to find this at the grocery store;I've tried them all and keep coming back to the Belgian chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream.
5;Doggy Treat;Gracie, our dog, loves these.  we have the treat ball that we put the treats in and she usually gets the treat out in about 10 minutes and chews them up.
4;Good Rooibos (but I'm not diggin' the espresso strength thing);I am a Rooibos junkie. I have been drinking it for a few years and adore it.
5;Love These Chips!!!!;Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.
5;Mix with meat;I rehydrate then add my meat a few vitamins and other goodies..
2;HOW MANY EARS ARE WE BUYING???  ONE?;Two stars is generous for this item's DESCRIPTION. I (and apparently MANY others) cannot find the details of what exactly one is purchasing here.
1;*** CHOKING HAZARD ***;We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this.
3;Very Sweet!;The Holiday Collection arrived safe and sound - well packaged, thank goodness!  The product arrived quickly, too - faster than I expected.  Flavors are wonderful, but customers might want to know that for 'sugar free', they are very, very sweet.
5;WOW! Whattachip!;VERY good, arrived fast. Of all the kettle style chips I've had, the thickness of these really pushes the crunch factor.
5;I does work...;I must say that I bought this product with no much hope for it to work, but I really help to relax my muscles actually I use it even for the times that I felt like I was going to be sick and it helps a lot. if you are seriously stress and have constant pain well you may need something stronger but for general discomfort this is a good way to go.
5;Like it, more absorbable...;This product works better than other forms of magnesium I've tried.  I was a little over-zealous with it when I first got it and got the runs.
4;Excellent Quality and Value;I really enjoyed this product. It tastes good and is very close to the Russian or Iranian versions.
1;What a disappointment;"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class."
1;Greenies killed my beloved cat.;My elderly cat loved these, so I gave him all he wanted.  They blocked his intestine and caused his peritoneum to rupture.
2;Not as good as I had hoped.;I tried this litter hoping to find a natural alternative to my current clay litter. It has a nice consistency but it's fairly dusty.
4;Light and Smooth;I must admit, I have never tried illy coffee drink products before, but I have tried other brands. Assuming this product would be about the same, I eagerly ordered it to review for amazon vine.
5;YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!;This is the first time I have ever written a review.  This stuff is AMAZING.
5;Absolutely Heavenly,,,;Namaste baking mixes have fulfilled an empty spot in my diet- that spot reserved for comfort food, sweet tooth fulfillment, and just plain convenient yumminess!<br />Since my diagnosis of celiac disease, I have been unable to find anything as remotely delicious as the regular cakes and brownies..
4;Unique Size;Usually can only find a 3 tier or a 5 tier. This is one is perfect size sitting next to the machine.
4;Good grab and go snack.;These are good to take when we're out and about- and this one is my favorite Blend. They're a little expensive but I'm definitely paying for the convienience.
5;amazing with lemon!;well, here i am again in my 3rd trimester..
4;Yummy but not a healthy veggie alternative;I gave them a 4 rating for being yummy, crispy and different.  I won't buy again because they were way too greasy and salty.
2;Sambal Oelek Cellophane packaging and shipping;This chili sauce is wonderful, with a fresh chili taste. It's served in many Chinese restaraunts.
5;Real stevia extract with no additives;This is real stevia extract without any additives. Most of the companies that claim to be selling stevia are really selling stevia extract combined with other things, like fiber or artificial sweeteners, but this is the real deal.
5;Nice snack food;I have eaten these for years. No, they are not a health food and don't pretend to be.
5;"This salt blows away ""Real"" salt!";I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling.
5;Red Barn Roll Dog Food;The dog food is excellent. My Akbash and Anatolians Love It.
3;Too much caffeine;Taste good but I think I will stick with the regular beans without the caffeine. Good if you need a pick me up during your training though.
4;A little disappointed!;"I have been a Senceo coffee fan for quite a few years and have loved the rich taste, aroma and flavor of the ""SENCEO"" brand coffees. Lately the pods I have received are covered with coffee grounds and invariably each pack of pods has 1 or 2 pods that have separated enough to allow the grounds to leak out."
3;Not as good as it used to be;"The ingredients have not been updated in the description, and are no longer accurate.<br />The ""New Formula!"" is actually a cheaper formula."
4;Nice conditioning;I've been very happy with the Clear line of products. They've performed as well as pricier brands and work well for my hair.
5;The Cats Love 'Em. Only Two Calories Each.;We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need.
5;nice pig ears;I have bought pig ears for my dogs for over 12 years and these were the perfect size. Very big but not huge.
3;Bitter Brew;I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.
1;Brown and Old;My first disappointment with Amazon.  Instead of Amber Sugar Cyrstals, these were mahogany, coco brown, and old.
5;Amazing with Salmon;Get a Salmon filet, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, some herbs and drizzle Vincotto over the Salmon before baking in the oven..
5;the best, the very best;This is my favorite chocolate ever!  Much better than Lindt or any other brand.  It's smooth and milky.
4;Double Black Diamond;A nice strong brew. I am new to Keurig and have lived on French press for years.
5;Yum!;I love these pretty little tea bags!  so yummy and the jasmine just soothes your soul.  I love this tea and so happy to show it off when my friends come over!  great great.
5;My twins love it!;Cheap and good.  My twins love it.
5;best hot sauce around;absolutely love the habenaro sauce..
5;o yummy!;We, sadly, eat too many of these. The good news is that Amazon is out of these at the time of my writing.
1;I Don't Like;Guess I'm in the minority here!  I just received my package with the butter toffee peanuts and couldn't wait to try them..
3;"Chocolate ""delight"", whatever you say";I've used the peanut butter version of these to control blood sugar for a while and decided to try a different flavor. Somehow, they managed to make it taste even worse, with the added benefit of getting caught in your throat and causing a sawdusty coughing fit.
5;I really like this.;"Picked this up at the checkout  ""impulse buy""  as my energy level is not good lately -  and heard friends talking about using the 5 hr shots.  I actually only drank half and for me it gave me the lift I desired -  the taste was nice & not crazy sweet."
4;Good cookies!;These cookies have a clean, crispy chocolate taste -- without the chemical-laced aftertaste of other commercially produced cookies. They are all-natural and made with canola oil, as opposed to the oils that can add to cholesterol problems.
5;EXCELLENT Hair Conditioner - Blonde Hair;I LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR!  I am caucasian with blonde highlighted hair. My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long.
4;Good cookie;This shortbread is a little less moist than I like, but the taste is good. There is no artifical sugar aftertaste.
5;Tastylicious!;We love this coffee. It's not bitter and has a very great flavor.
5;Energy Drink vs Red Bull;I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.
5;Disappeared over holidays;These peach flavored gummi candies dissapeared quickly over the holidays. Both children and grandchildren enjoyed them.
2;Disgusting!  So Artificial!;I picked up two packages of these cookies because the price was right and the packaging was bright and cheerful.  The artificial flavoring in these cookies is downright disgusting.
3;The Idea was nice;"The idea was on the right track, but it look my thirty pound dog about a minute to dislodge the ""everlasting"" treat (which took him about ten minutes to consume). He's not a power chewer either."
1;Huge Disappointment;If your desire is to relive childhood memories through your taste buds, this underwhelming substitute will make you feel like crying.<br /><br />Candy cigarettes I bought in the mid to late 1960s had a wonderfully subtle (still can't name it) flavor that was so enjoyable I'd suck on one end of a candy cigarette to try to make it last as long as I could, and would innevitably be unable to resist biting into it.
5;Aero Mint Chocolate Bars;I became acquainted with Aero Mint Chocolate Bars while in England this past summer. My granddaughter and I both LOVE them.
2;K cups were open inside this box of 50 Jet Fuel brand;"I like coffee peoples coffee called ""Jet fuel"" I have been drinking it for 2 years. I have never received a shipment like this one."
1;DO NOT recomment this product!;I too have baked gluten free for years. I normally use Bob's Red Mill xanthan gum, but picked up a package of the Ener-G brand when Bob's Red Mill wasn't available.
2;All I taste is Splenda;This product has sugar, honey, sucralose, and maltodextrin. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame.
1;Bitter, Burned Flavor. Major Aftertaste.;With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.
5;Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula;My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year.
3;Fairly tasty.;Surprisingly mild mint taste. It is alright, nice over ice on a hot day.
5;Excellent!!!;Another great coffee from Lavazza. I usually use the Cafe Espresso blend but his one is even better.
2;Not quite right;I bought these to sub in for cheese crackers for my holiday chex mix recipe.  They worked ok but there is a strange aftertaste that's a little like getting sawdust in your mouth.
4;Dog loved the food...but;It didn't last that long.  I've got a 20lb Scottish Terrier, and this bag barely made it a month.
5;Love these...;First time I've bought these, and thought it would be a nice addition to add to my smoothies.  After reading a review on here where someone mentioned eating them by themselves, I gave it a try.
4;Yummy quick low fat snack;I really enjoy this product. The taste is great and the texture is nice and chewy just like jerky should be.
1;crap;These hambugers had no taste, I think the box they were shipped in would of had more flavor. Don't waste your money on this product unless you need a hockey puck.
5;Love pirates booty! :);The cheese kind used to be my favorite, now the veggie definately is!  To be honest it always taste a little funny the first couple bites (TOO much like veggies, ick!) :)  but then after those couple of bites I just cant stop!  Its nice to have a tasty crunchy snack that i dont really feel guilty eating! :)  I also let my toddler snack on them too and I am the mom that doesnt let him have any junk food (no chips, cookies, candy, etc)<br /><br />Since there are no preservatives i love the little bags because if the big one isnt sealed properly the whole things goes stale SO fast.<br /><br />The small size is also SUPER handy to keep in my purse or the diaper bag.
5;I like these fishies;Great for a snack or meal on the go.<br /><br />The stone ground mustard is good with the herrings fillets
5;Aweseome!;Packaging arrives safely and well packed. Great taste on all three flavors, however I find it funny that each flavor has its own different shake.
5;Everybody loves these!  Mildly addictive...;Someone brought this to the beach as a 'hostess' gift.  My heavens,  I am not sure how we functioned before we had these in our life.
5;More please;Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm.
5;Addictively good!;I love granola
1;I normally Love Larabars but the jocalat was gross.;I normally love Larabars. I have tried a few favors and have loved them all but there is something really off about the Jocalat bar.
5;Great, soothing tea;This is a great soothing tea. For those who aren't wild about the taste of green tea, I think that the addition of the white tea mellows it out a bit.
5;All beef wonderful;My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own.
5;My dogs love these!!;Lean Treats are a great product and my two english bulldogs devour them every time they are treated!!  I found them on sale at my Vet's office and bought a pack and I've continued to purchase them online for great value every since.  One of my bullies has to take daily medication and these make it easy to hide the pills inside and she just gobbles it up, no problem.
5;dog treats;There isn't much my puppy won't do or try to do for one of<br />the freeze dried liver treats. Gave one to another Springer Spaniel<br />we met at the beach and now when I see him he races, sometimes<br />a long distance, to great me and get another treat.
1;Worst dont even buy them;I hate these ..
5;I love these chips.  They are thick and crunchy!;These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.
5;OooH Yummy!;I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great.
5;Cafe Quality for Homemade Price;Not a coffee drinker but love the lattes and cappuccinoes.  Can't afford the daily visits to Starbucks or Horton's, etc.
5;they are not sick anymore;I have three dog friends. Maggie, my 14 year old Aussie had some problems($2,000.
2;ok but not the best;I have ordered coffee beans through Amazon numerous times.  I've also ordered from the particular roasting company on more than one occasion.
1;I can't believe it was instant;I really wish Amazon would actually have REAL coffee k-cups on subscribe and save..
5;Alba Toner - great for sensitive skin!;Love this product because I have rosecea on one side of my face and it is gentle enough for that buut strong enough to get rid of any remaining traces of makeup or oil, leaving a nice fresh feeling on the skin. Along with the price being very reasonable, you only use a little on a pad so the product goes a long way.
5;Bench & Field Holistic feline treats;This is now my cats favorite treat. He comes in the kitchen every morning to wait for me to get him his morning snack.
5;Delicious, pure coconut water;I was very pleased with this coconut water. It tastes fresh, pure and delicious.
4;Scores well for what it is;There are so many dark chocolate bars out these days from all over the world.  Many claim to be delicious as well as healthy.
5;Yogi Seven-Berry;The better taste of all teas that I tried, I use this at night and I do not lose sleep unlike other tea. Yogi is my preferred tea brand.
5;Wonderful!;This bread is by far the best gluten free bread I have eaten. It is moist, and it tastes sweet, and not like most gluten free breads.
5;Excellent Teriyaki sauce!;I cannot sum it up any better than previous post.  I have only had teriyaki marinaded steak this good from one of the high end meat market's in town.
5;Great Taste!;One of my favorites..
5;Fail Safe For My Son;My son loves this soup. The large noodles are great and the soup is filled with carrots and celery.
5;Real nice coffee!;Just a sweet and enjoyable coffee. Almost a dessert coffee, but I drink it all of the time.
4;Tangy but not spicy;"This is an ok sauce.  The sauce is creamy and a bit ""tangy"" in my opinion."
5;Bread Baking;"I really like useing ""Saco"" cultured buttermilk blend.I make lots of cornbread,biscuits etc."
5;Affordable, Great Discount w/Autoship & Free Ship!;Go to the Natural Value website and read about the Sacramento California company and you'll feel even more confident about the quality of their products and the company's beliefs, especially in fair trade. All the pet food cans are BPA-free now as well.
4;Definitely strong but with less acid;One thing great about America is a lot of choices. One thing bad about America is a lot of choices.
4;Tastes Great - Horrible Price;I just bought about 20 boxes of these from the dollar store for $1 each. They're awesome but this is way over priced.
5;good light coffee flavor;If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.
5;excellent oil;In our home, we only use extra virgin olive oil (evoo), a little real butter, and sometimes a little coconut oil.  95% of the time, it's evoo.
1;smells and tastes like plastic;Very disappointed.  All the coffee and hot chocolate we made had a plastic-like after taste.
5;Yumm from me too;Yay Hormel! I seldom eat meats from any other brand. This is a good one.
5;Cream of Tartar;The product was delivered quickly. The price was very reasonable.
5;perfect for kids!;"I love Pirate's Booty- they are like little cheesy puffs of happiness, without the neon-orange-greasy-dustiness of anything with the word ""Cheez"" in the name. They are a bit more *tangy* than the average ""cheez puff"", so if you have a sensitive palette, be warned that it's a slightly different flavor."
5;Not Me, But My Husband!;Actually, I think it's great because my husband loves it.  We do not use it as a salad dressing, but rather a 'sauce' for stir-frying.
3;Not my favorite - not even close;"""Van Houtte Cr&egrave"
5;Yummy;Yummy plus nutritious. A real treat.
5;Awesome brew, strong, bold!;Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.
4;Good and hot;These olives are some off the hottest I've had.<br />It was a little expensive to ship them , but if you can't find them anywhere in the stores around my town it was worth it.
5;Yum;I tried to just write yum like 20 times but it wouldn't let me.  But I tried because this stuff is so good.
5;yummers.;i was waiting for this and although it took a while to happen, i was glad to finally see flavored coffee pods.  some pre-flavored varieties taste fake and were sometimes oily from the flavoring added to them.
5;Great Coffee if you like your Coffee STRONG>>>;Great deal and good coffee.  It is a little too strong for me but I am a wimp.
1;Toxic Hexane used in extraction of DHA;I bought both the rice and oatmeal 6 packs.  The cans clearly state they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek).
1;Short Cups;After receiving coffee, I tried a cup through my Kurig coffee maker, and saw that the cups themselves were ony half full.  The whole shipment was the same way.
5;YUMMY;I MAKE MY OWN HOMEMADE VANILLA. RECEIVED ENOUGH VANILLA BEANS TO MAKE MY FRIEND A BOTTLE OF VANILLA.
1;Beware of Soy Lecithin!;I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the crap they scrape off the floor.
4;Healthy Chocolate!;Delicious, deep chocolate without the insidious bad effects of white sugar.  I voted the Orange flavor in this brand a 5.
1;Warning about Ella's organic baby food iron content !!! Read all please!!!;"As simple as that: nutritional information is NOT accurate !!!<br />Iron content in purple bag is only 2%, NOT 45% as stated on the pouch itself !!!!!!!!!!!<br />Light green pouch ""Rutabagas"", contains Iron: 4%, NOT 120% stated on the package itself !!!!!!!<br />We have fed 2 packs daily: 1 light green ""rutabagas"" and 1 purple one - ""pumpkins"" to our girl since she was 3.5 month old."
3;Taste;Didn't care for this flavor at all.  The delievery and service were excellent.
2;Taste like chocolates but why labeled as Weight Watchers???;"I bought these thinking they would actually be less fat being labeled after a big-name weight reduction group.  13 grams of fat a serving?  Really?  Is that what is considered ""weight watching""?  It was a bag of Whitman's chocolates pre-packaged under the WW brand and sold as something much more expensive but basically about the same fat content as just buying Whitman's chocolates and eating 3."
5;Great tasting coffee!;I love Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee for Keurig K-cups. It really has the taste of butter toffee and is not bitter.
5;Totally Worth the money!!!;I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it.
5;Excellent;I purchased this product to use during a weight loss program, to eliminate unnessary oils in my body. I am very happy with this alba oil-free moisturizer.
3;Really delicious, but not worth the price.;I did enjoy the snacks. Since I am diabetic there are few such snacks I can get away with and this one did not affect my blood sugar adversely.
5;I Am Never Without It!!!;I first knew about it when I started working in a neighborhood that had a number of Vietnamese restaurants.  It's kept on the table like soy sauce or salt and pepper.
5;A very good value;I originally bought Timothy's camomile tea and really liked it, but the price has doubled since then. I found this to be a great bargain and is just as good.
5;Good Stuff;This is really good stuff.  Throw on a little yogurt and you have a nutritious, delicious breakfast.
2;INSTANT HEARTBURN;I can handle any food in moderation with no heartburn..
5;Mallomars are the Best!;Ah, a mallomar..
5;I love it;I bought the soda maker and the energy mix it's just like red bull but a little sweeter it saved me Money instead of buying red bull every day I just made it. it was great.
4;Good product but never again;This was a really good product and tasted wonderful, but for someone who had never used fondant before we found it a real pain in the [you know where]. The great thing was that you could redo it.
4;Delicious;This was exactly what I was looking for. My local Trader Joe's used to sell this during the holidays but stopped selling their liqueur cakes so I thought I was out of luck because I'd looked at other stores in my area.
4;Pleasant but bland;A box of Higgins & Burke Earl Grey Tea was sent to me by Amazon Vine for review. Here's my take on it.
3;Tough beans;Maybe I don't know what these are supposed to be like, so I won't give them a one star, but these were tough - the skin was tough no matter how long I cooked them.  I used them in a cassoulet, and the next time I will go for plain white beans and not bother with white kidney beans.
1;Gluten free cookies;Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.
5;Best cornbread mix I've ever had!;Gluten-free or not, this is the best cornbread mix I have ever had - period.  Even my gluten loving friends prefer this to their usual cornbread.
3;Not bad if you like bland chili;Although the title of this review might sound as if I didn't like the product, that isn't true.  I did like it, mostly because I DO like my chili to be very mild due to a stomach disorder.
5;GREAT CATFOOD;"Because of our cat's digestive problems, and due to multiple unsuccessful trials of other ""top"" brands of canned cat food, led us to try the WELLNESS brands. Our feline-centric veterinarian concurred, and I am happy to report that after 2 weeks, our cat is responding wonderfully!<br /><br />He is a ""new"" cat! He LOVES THIS FOOD! A great, all-natural product."
3;Prefer Barrista;This coffee is just ok
5;Very aromatic and flavorful, and a great value;Want some freshly ground nutmeg flavor but without having to grind whole nutmeg? These little nutmeg grinders are great and measure up. True, there might be some loss of aroma since the nutmeg is in chunks rather than whole, but I've found these grinders and the nutmeg they contain to be very flavorful -- and certainly much more so than the pre-ground nutmeg you get in shaker bottles.
5;Good food for our dogs;I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well.
1;mom1;My daughter found these bars way too hard to bite into.  I was very disappointed with them, and the company does not honor the 100% satification guarentee they advertise.
1;Tough;I totally agree with the other one star reviews, these leaves were not edible, the veins were like wire. I followed my recipe and cooked these for 1 hour.
3;A Great Crunch, but a Poor Flavor;I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.
4;It's an olive tampanade chip!;I really love olive tampanade and these chips brought the taste home
4;Great Coffee;I love my kcups coffee. This is an excellent product.
5;Great product for my baby at a great price!;Instead of cow's milk, my 1 year old is drinking goats milk as it is easier on his stomach to digest.  The price on the powder from Amazon costs $1.
5;Love It!;The product is excellent and the price for a pack of 50 was outstanding!!!<br />When you drink as much coffee as I do, you need lots of back up! It was shipped in a matter of days and it was in perfect shape. Thank you Amazon.
4;Overall good product, cost effective;This works, tastes better than other similar products (though I don't think any energy shot product can really taste GOOD) and was much less expensive than others. It's really sweet and tart but doesn't leave the bad taste in your mouth I've experienced with stuff like 5 hr energy.
1;Safer Brand 7270 Clothes Moth Alert Trap;These DO NOT work. Don't waste your money.
5;Just the Right Blend;I was hesitant at first when I saw this coffee. I'm not a big hazelnut fan since most companies over do the hazelnut in the coffee and creamers.
1;Unpleasant;This tea is unpleasantly heavy on the cloves, which is an ingredient that should ALWAYS be used sparingly for just a hint of flavor. It completely burned out my palate.
5;Great Variety!;As new Keurig users, we wanted to try a lot of different types of drinks before we bought any full packs. This is a great way to do just that.
4;Stash Premium Peppermint Herbal Tea;Very nice product.  It was fresh and in date and shipped quickly.
4;Product was better than expected, fast shipping!;This mate was much better than I had expected..
4;Great Tasting, Low Calorie Treat!;I'm a chocoholic, but am very picky when it comes to my sweets.  I love these SKINNY COW CLUSTERS, which were created to be similar to a turtle without the nuts.
5;Cat loves it, and doesn't scarf it down like junk food;I judge this product by my cat's reaction and health. She is not overweight nor underweight, she seems to like this product, she eats it easily but not greedily like it is junk food (which she has done with other brands).
4;very good decaf coffee;This is a very good full body coffee, for a decaf it's a good choice. I prefer a dark roast coffee, this coffee is very close to what I consider the ideal roast.
5;Mindblowingly Good;It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda.
5;Not bad at all;These are different from your average packaged bar. Each individual package contains two thin, crunchy bars as opposed to the standard one sticky, chewy bar.
1;tastes like paper!;I'm usually impressed with this brand's stevia products, but not with these individually packed ones. These don't taste sweet in the slightest
1;NOT CRUNCHY;Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive.
5;...Little thin but tastes great!;Yum! I love this stuff. Gives steak a sweet tangy kick without the carbs.
1;This is not pretzel salt;Save your money especially for shipping, this is NOT pretzel salt.  This salt is nothing more than kosher salt that you pay alot for shipping to your house, you can get this in any grocery store.
5;delicious and excellent in tapenade;I bought these olives originally to make a Sicilian salad using fennel, blood oranges, oil cured olives and olive oil.  The result was ok the first time but very salty.
4;Wish this variety pack included more green veggies;We like this variety pack, and our baby eats all four varieties and seems to like them all.  However, it's unfortunate that the only green vegetable in this variety pack is green peas.
5;Excellent product!;Love this low fat alternative product!  I use it in savory and sweet recipies!  It is a bit salty so I reduce any additional salt required.<br />The only drawback is the shipping cost.
5;Best poppy seeds on Amazon...;These are 100% pure Papaver somniferum seeds. As another reviewer notes they are unwashed and very earthy, great for just about any use from muffins, cakes or tea.
5;love this coffee...;was not sure I would be keeping my machine since I really love a dark roasted cup of coffee.  This one fits the bill and now I love my machine AND the coffee it makes.
4;Good On Cereal, So-So For Drinking;3.5 Stars to be exact.
5;Baked Lay's Potato Chips;Great product. The small individual packages make it easy to take chips to work daily to have with my lunch.
5;Quinoa Not Like Anything Else;"I got started on Quinoa when ""health food"" set off my food allergies and I was desperate to find non gluten and not rice or soy milk foods without the high fat concentrations of vegetable fat.<br />Quinoa was my God send to settle my system down."
5;Dogs Love it!;This food gets pretty good reviews as a medium priced, good quality food. Our dogs seem to love it and it's helped the one with chronic allergy problems.
5;Far Better Than Expected;This coffee is more than just a hyper-caffeinated gimmick. Although it's caffeine content really isn't that much higher than other blends you might be drinking (~150 mg per cup: Definitely not deserving the hyper-caffeinated name
5;I add it to soups, brown rice, quinoa, etc;I started eating this about a year ago after reading how healthy sea vegetables are for you.  I add it to many different dishes.
1;Smells good...;I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider.
3;Kind;"""Kind Healthy Grains"""
5;Yummy with Coffee!;These are great morning treats! The filling layer is very thin, I wish it had a bit more. I totally recommend these for your sweet tooth fix.
5;Yummy! And a real bargain!;I've been a loyal fan/user of Sequel's MacaSure (powder form) in the past but it's fairly expensive, so when I stumbled across this Maca at this amazing price I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Well, I was ever pleasantly surprised! I liked using MacaSure like a spice/condiment, sprinkling it over omelettes and salads
5;Delicious;We have recently switched to a paleo/primal way of eating and were struggling to find how to replace butter.  I am so glad we have found ghee!  Delicious addition to any dish.
3;OK, not outstanding;I enjoy a pure, unadulterated horseradish with plenty of zing.  The label, with dual info in Russian and English, enticed me to try the product.
5;Perfect;Perfect Cajun snack mix. Everyone in the family loved it and the mix of different ingredients was spot on.
5;Hard to find;This has become really hard to find in the stores, so I was delighted to see it on Amazon.<br /><br />Love this tea.
5;If you like hot chocolate you will LOVE this!;I have tried hundreds of hot chocolates from the really expensive and really cheap and this is by far the best you can ever have. It is creamy and the wonderful taste of Butterfingers.
1;Not a good deal!;Like many other people here, I bought this based on a lightning deal on the site.  Even at a sale price, this wasn't worth it!  I was hoping this would be a dessert for 4-5 people, but it is barely a snack for 2 people.
5;My Pup Absolutely Loves These;I was turned on to the Blue Buffalo brand by the trainer at the training class I signed me and my pup for.  He is my new little fur ball so I have been very cautious about what he eats and the type of foods that he is exposed to.
5;My German Shepherd loves these;My German Shepherd loves these even though he is not much for chewing bones. I have tried different brands and shapes and this one is a keeper.
5;Great taste and low caffeine;I enjoy the taste of this tea. It's more earthy and satisfying than green tea, but similar.
4;Great cup of coffee;I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic.
5;McD's Coffee;If you like McDonald's coffee you will like this. It tastes identical to McDonald's coffee.
5;Great product, and fantastic customer service;This is the  first time that I ordered Palm Sugar from Amazon.  The order arrived and there is a broken pack inside the box.
4;Nice taste, but over priced;Back to Nature mixed nuts actually tasted very nice, the only additional ingredient was sea salt.  I would had bought this product again, however the price is a little high.
5;My favorite!;This is my favorite late evening cup of coffee.  Nice flavor, just right before retiring for the night.
5;Great Deal!!!!;THe order came in earlier than expected. I t was cheaper for me to purchase the two pack compared to buying just one package at the time! I enyjoy thai tea and for average of 6.
5;One of my favorite ingredient secrets!;The brand of sweet dough flavoring is delicious. It tastes buttery, with a hint of vanilla and a slight blend of citrus! It's almost magical in baking sweet breads, sugar cookies and especially cinnamon rolls.
5;Yummy delicious crunch;I ordered both the Chili Nacho and the Parmesan. I found the chili nacho may favorite.
5;All day flavor;I made gamja tang last night and at the end of cooking I poured a little soup in a bowl, then in the pot I added the some of the youndoo sauce. My regular bowl of soup was tasty but a little bland but the youndoo sauce was so flavorful.
4;Healthy and flavorful option, but not cheap;My dog enjoys these treats, but they are expensive in terms of cost per pound. I had received the cheese version in a large bag from a family member as a gift, but this bag is significantly smaller.
5;Therapy for my Sister;My sister, Betty, who just had double knee surgery, needed a boost to cheer her up after the surgery.  Well, this was the perfect gift.
4;Delicious, but frosting takes some patience;A not-too-sweet cupcake topped with an almost-too-sweet frosting.  Easy to make, although cooking time was 3-4 minutes over the recommended time.
4;Very good tortilla strips but packaging is poor.;My order arrived in a big cardboard box. The bags were just placed in the box and shipped.
5;Best ever!;These are truly the best peanuts I've ever had..
5;terrific;I did some cooking last night with chicken tenders, sliced Vidalia onions and 8 ounces of this and it was terrific. I sauteed the tenders in a bit of oil, then dumped my onions on top and added the broth and it all cook down.
3;Very Strong;I generally like Chai Tea, however, this one is very, very strong for use in the Keurig. I would suggest watering it down or something.
5;Super hot, but good.;I got sick of my hot sauces, and thought I'd try some of the hot stuff. I bought a few Ghost Pepper hotsauces from Amazon, and saw the Satans Blood.
5;This is the best Chai!;This is by far the best tasting Chai product I have used. It tastes great hot, or as an iced latte.
2;My dog loves them;BUT I should have thoroughly gone through the ingredients before I purchased them not after.  I wasn't happy.
3;Short 2 cups;I just received my order for a 24 cup sampler pack. There were only 22 K cups in the package.
3;Great flavor, Lousy price;Can get it for half this price and no shipping on othe sites.  Look around and you will find them.
4;Good Product;I felt comfortable feeding my dog this product but the high protein caused him to urinate too much.  Since he is not a very active dog I switched him to Blue Buffalo and his system is doing a lot better.
5;Best Dog Bones Around;I have 2 dogs and they both love them.  My mastiff can eat anything, but my beagle has a very sensative stomach.
5;I LOVE THIS STUFF;I've tried many Amy's soups and I absolutely love all of them, including their frozen products too. I've actually lost a good deal of weight too eating the chunky vegetable soup in the evenings.
5;Best flavor;This is my favorite Trident flavor.  My experience with the others has been crap.
5;Great value for a good quality jerky;Great item to do Sub & Save on so you can keep a healthy snack on hand for work, school or just at home. Teriyaki is my personal favorite.
3;weak???;This flavor was a little weak on cinnamon..
1;YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING;This price is twice what one can buy this product at the store. What gives? Nobody should consider this product at these prices.
5;Absolutely Incredible!!!;Hot & Spicy Cheez-Its represent a mind-blowing achievement in the development of snack food.<br /><br />Buy these.
1;Contains GMOs! We say NO!;Kellogg's Frosted Flakes cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product.
4;Good Decaf K Cup;Timothy makes a good decaf.  It is a medium flavored blend that works for both my husband and me.
1;Bitter, bitter;"I usually love Yogi products but this one is TERRIBLE!!  It is so bitter I cannot even drink it.  The <a href=""http://www."
5;Delicious and healthy coconut butter;People are being turned on to the healthy benefits of raw coconut butter.  Try it.
5;The Best of All of Them;I've tried ever single brand of K-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. It is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff.
5;Great tasting energy snack;I'm hooked on these and the honey flavored ones too. I enjoy the extra energy I get without the feeling of a sugar rush and the price is right here at Amazon.
5;Poppin' Good Northern Popcorn!;I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot.
5;Great to keep on hand for desserts!;This deal on Amazon with the Prime free shipping, and/or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do.  One of our favorites is layered graham crackers, this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping, and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting.
5;Fantastic taste;This item is delicious and a great way to have more protein in my diet.  So good that I have ordered more.
4;good, not great;rose flavor takes some getting used to.<br /><br />Next time I have an itch for turkish delight, i'll get other flavors.
5;Papillions Love Greenies!;Our Papillions love Greenies!  They help keep the tartar under control.  This breed is notorious for bad tartar build up on their teeth and having to have dentals twice a year.
5;Finally! A jerky that isn't made with sugar!;It is nearly impossible to find jerky anywhere that isn't basted with sugar, or dextrose (same thing!). I was so glad to find this jerky, and when I ordered it I wondered if it would be any good.
5;mauna loa macadamia nuts;While expensive, these are excellent. I would order them again, though I can get them in stores for less money at times.
4;Spicy and a good base!;Nong Shim noodle bowls are good quality and have nicely flavored soup bases. This Kimchi flavored choice has good spice and balance with a pinch of the usual dehydrated vegetables and good quality dry noodles.
5;My Favorite Cracker;I love these crackers. They are perfect with a goat cheese spread, and I eat them for lunch all the time.
5;Delicious;My wife loves this stuff.  It basically turns any beer that she's drinking into candy beer LOL.
1;Hard as a rock!;Ordered these from Amazon in March of 2011, as they were on sale. Sadly, the bars are so hard, as to risk tooth injury.
2;Shop-rite price;This is a really good product but not a great price.  Shop-rite's normal price is the same as the subscribe and save price.
5;Clear skin;My Yorkshire Terrier had some skin problems when I had him on dog food brands I bought at local stores. I did some online research about possible causes and found food quaity and ingredients could be the cause.
3;DOn't know how to generate those milk bubble.;Maybe the coffee maker isn't suitable. I can't make any milk bubble like the picture on the box.
5;da bomb;this is the best snack on the planet. every little molecule of this item is vibrating with the love that comes from growing, harvesting, making and distributing it in harmony with nature.
1;If You Like A Heavily Medicinal-Tasting Soft Drink With A Long-Lasting Unpleasant Aftertaste,Then Switch Black Cherry Is For You;"Being a big fan of carbonated soft drinks, juice drinks and the black cherry flavor, I couldn't wait to get my free sample from Vine. The old adage ""Be careful what you wish for"" has rarely applied more than to The Switch Black Cherry product."
4;dark roast;very dark roast, strong coffee, very good.  Sorry, the rest of message is fill in to make it to the new rule by amazon of at least 20 words.
5;All natural and not toasted!;Its so refreshing to find a muesli that is all natural, not toasted or loaded with additional sugar! The flavour is great ..
5;Orangemint Water;This is the best water!  It is cool and refreshing anytime!  The best thing, there are no calories and all natural.  Do you have it where you can be thirsty, but when you take a drink, the water doesn't taste good?  Orangemint always tastes great!  The downfall of the water is it is a little spendy.
1;Don't waste your money!;Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.
4;Great Taste, but Artificial Sweeteners;I was leery of the concept of Mio, but decided to try them anyways.<br /><br />Have tried quite a few different flavors, and the peach tea is by far my favorite.
5;This sounds like HEAVEN!;Okay, we start out with Quakers' LIFE CEREAL.<br />We coat it with Maple Syrup.
5;All time best pectic available!;I've been using this for years, and teaching others how to make jam with it also. Last year some of my new jammers accidently bought other brands of pectin.
4;Used for meat rubs;I use this in meat rubs for smoking. I don't really notice a difference between regular and sweet paprika, but this is a good deal for a spice that is used a lot for meat rubs.
5;"The ""Green Pearl"" of Tea.";"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907)."
5;Offers the whole espresso experience minus the jolt;I have had bad experiences with decaf coffees and teas from other brands in the past so I was apprehensive about trying illy's Decaf. But surprise! Despite the color of the espresso liquid being just a tinge lighter than illy's medium Red Band, the aroma and taste are quite identical.
5;Terrific for Prepared;I really like this soup and have also prepared it as a main meal. Add tofu, chicken, scallops or shrimp and serve over basmati rice.
5;Taste good;I was actually surprised at how good these Muffins taste! I have reordered a case.  And they are Gluten Free.
5;Kind Plus, Cranberry & Almond;Excellent bar, very tastey.  It is a bit messy to eat because of the honey so I would not recommend carrying it with you.
5;Perfect Storage!;"This capsule carousel was the perfect addition to my <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;No complaints;The bones showed up quickly and were good quality. I have no complaints and would recommend the company and product.
4;You must try these;I love cacao, and so have tried 2 or 3 brands of raw nibs.  I think some people use these for cooking but I just like to eat them for snacks.
5;The BEST;I have a four year old, three year old and 18 month old that love these. When I buy them, I have to get very creative with hiding them or they'll eat them all at once.
4;A unique flavor for fans of Thai food;"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."
5;Roasted to a turn;This product provided tasty coffee, and is cleverly packaged with a nod to the environment. In all, a great selection.
5;Delicious and healthy;My review is for the Cinnamon cookie in the small bag.  I love them!!!  I do not have gluten issues, but I like the fact that the cookies are gluten free.
5;Delicious Tea at an affordable Price;Bewtter than I had hoped for at this price.  Nicely packaged in a rugged airtight bag.
5;There is no other!;Used Tony Caschere original for 12 years now and nothing else.  Every kind of meat on the grill or in the oven.
4;Different and good;Cooks up easily.  Very tasty cooked in chicken stock.
5;I LOVE this stuff!;This is perfect! I use it a lot, in sauces, as a rub, in dips, all kinds of cooking. Loved the larger amount, no one around here has the larger size and after the last trip couldn't find it in any size! Obviously others like it too.
2;Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.;I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps.
5;Hot stuff;I love Sriracha and did not know where to purchase it.  I am thrilled with receiving this large (28Oz.
1;Nasty and questionable: MADE IN CHINA. Read the news!!!!;FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..
5;Red Vines -- the REAL lifesaver;HERMAN, RON & HARRY were running through a dark forest to escape a vicious vampire! They took cover behind a tree root.<br /><br />Harry: Are you alright, Herman?<br />Herman: Yeah, I'm alright.
5;tasty Maybe beneficial;My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters.
3;Overpowering flavor;I love flavored coffees, but in many of them the added flavor overwhelms the coffee flavor.  While I do enjoy flavored coffees, I still want to taste the flavor of the coffee, too.
1;Awful;I bought a can of this soup from Wholefoods because I had a coupon. The consistency was gelatinous, the flavor was bland and salty.
3;we have 4 differnt coffee machines and this didn't fit any of them;We tried every which way to make this coffee. It is frustrating that each coffee must have it's own system to work.
5;LOCO FOR VITA COCO!;I'm seriously addicted to this stuff. Its definitely one of my drinks.
2;Brew seems a bit weak for my tastes;I evaluated this coffee blend while travelling.  Most hotel rooms come equipped with single-brew coffee makers, do this product received a thorough testing.
5;The Dogs Loved Them;My dogs love this product.  It was a lot cheaper to buy it from Amazon than at the local pet store.
3;Quality Food But Puts Tartar on Teeth Quickly;I bought this food as it is rated as one of the best canned dog food that's out on the market.  And although that might be true, after only six cans of this (mixed half and half with dry dog food), my puppy's teeth went from bright white to having tartar build up.
5;Great training treats!;My little yorkie loves these treats. He recognizes the bag now and gets excited to hear treat.
2;8 out of the 12 cans were seriously dented;I did not post this under packaging review, because the order arrived fully sealed, no markings or damage to the outside box, but 8 out of the 12 cans were severly dented, so I had to assume they had been packaged that way.  They were even hard to open with the can opener.
1;I Sent Them Back;We have a B70. I tried 4 different kinds of k cups to refill and these leaked every time.
5;A huge hit with one of my cats;One of my cats, who rotates to a new favorite food about every 6 months, is currently wildly in love with this
5;Great Cheesy taste!;If you enjoy the taste of cheese but don't want a whole lot of added calories to your food, try this great cheese product.  You can have 2 teaspoons of this for only 25 calories.
5;Great BBQ flavor with a satisfying crunch;These are nothing like chips, but they are very yummy. The bbq flavor is delicious.
5;If it were socially acceptable to bathe in them, I would.;Popchips are just amazing, and the salt & pepper are our favorite. This shipment of 3-ounce bags never lasts more than 2 weeks.
5;Glyco-FlexIII Mini Chews;I am very pleased with this product. My dog is 17 years old and was getting a bit stiff in her joints.
3;It's Own Genre, Not Typical Expresso Roast;I bought this thinking these were typical expresso beans. They may be most often used to make expresso, but the flavor is unique.
5;Starbucks Veranda Blend Blonde K-cup coffee;I love the taste of this coffee.  It is light but still has a very nice flavor and color, not bitter at all.
5;Luzianne Seafood Coating Mix is a winner;We absolutely love this powder coating mix for white type fish filets that we cook on the stove top in olive oil.  Not too spicey for us.
5;Excellent product!;Wow..
5;Love it!;I love the portability of this product.  My daughter blessed me with a beautiful grandson in December 2011.
5;Best chips ever;The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch.
5;BEST SEAFOOD SEASONING AVAILABLE;Have used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning for many years. Although I have tried others, nothing compares to this one.
1;Overpriced;What can I say that you probably don't already know?  It's Monster, a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water.<br /><br />The problem is that I can find this MUCH cheaper in regular stores.
5;So happy to see Marge's on Amazon!;I have been buying Marge's vegan products for a while now in Whole Foods.  When I made the decision to become a vegan, it didn't take long for me to start to miss desserts that had the real stuff.
5;good starter;I use this starter to make homemade yogurt. Great flavor profile and easy to use with good instructions.
5;A great and satisfying treat for those on diets;I have been using the Jello pudding for a number of years as a treat in my weight management program.  We have noticed that many of our supermarkets here in the desert do not carry all the flavors of this pudding and we began looking for them in every market where we shopped.
5;better deal than walmart/costco;it's honey nut cheerios - you should know what it is by now and whether you like it or not.  what i want to comment is that if you have amazon.
5;Bisto Hmmmm good;Glad to find i can now buy this product on line. Used to use it in UK.
1;Inedible;This jerky is inedible.  You would have to reconstitute it in beef broth to be able to chew it.
5;Excellent Product;Perfect for smoothies! I didn't recognize any kind of taste or aftertaste, which is exactly what I was looking for. It didn't upset my stomach and was easy to digest.
5;THE definition of what Olive Oil is.;I can remember my first encounter with Laudemio over a decade ago.  It is like no other and there is a reason why it is expensive.
5;best spices ever;I was really happy to find this online thru Amazon, I have bought spices from  Sunny Caribbee while traveling, they are very good , especially the fish spice. Last time there I purchased a pound worth.
5;wonderfully roasted flavor;We had spent the afternoon roasting eggplant from the farm stand on the grill to make baba ganoush and as we were ready to make it, found we were just about out of tahini.  On a late Sunday afternoon, I went on a tahini run to our local grocery stores.
5;one of the Best !;Sahale makes several nut mixes but the Valdosta blend is one of the Best.<br /><br />Just enough pepper and sweet to satisfy with a small handful.
4;Good for cleaning your body/face;It's basically shower gel for men. Definitely has a manly-smelling cologne added: some men will like the scent and some will not, we found the scent to be okay.
5;THIS IS THE BEST HOT SAUCE;TIGER SAUCE IS THE BEST HOT SAUCE YOU CAN BUY IN THE USA!  (NO, I'M NOT YELLING.  This isn't yelling.
5;Heaven in a box!;After searching fruitlessly in the grocery stores in my area for these cookies that were the base for a favorite dessert when I was young (the recipe is STILL on the box decades later!), I finally found them on Amazon.  I ordered a case (pack of 12 boxes) so that I could send some to each of my kids, shared a box with a neighbor and kept some for myself.
4;Delicious but not the flavor you're used to.;When I first started drinking this soda, I was really surprised. None of the flavors that come in the rainbow case accurately recreate their non-stevia counterpart.
5;Best Gummies EVAR.;These gummies are so amazing juicy and tasteful. Your basically eating an orange when you chew these little heart gummies.
1;Care about your health? Run away screaming!;"This is the kind of garbage ""food"" that gives paleo/primal a bad name.<br /><br />Whenever you see the words ""Gluten-Free"" on a product label, you should immediately be skeptical."
2;Great in Every Way Except they STINK!!;I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).
1;Tasteless;I really love herbal tea, especially orange and mandarin. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste.
4;Dog loves them;My daughter introduced us to these dog treats.  Our dog absolutely loves them, but we have to limit her to one a day due to the cost.
5;Thank you Barney Butter!;My daughter is allergic to peanuts, cashews, and pistachios. And she is also a picky fussy eater.
5;I love these nuts.;They come in convenience small package.  The flavor is good.
1;Bitter and Awful;This tastes awful and nothing like peanuts or peanut butter.  Very bitter, with an aftertaste that lingers forever.
5;Heard of it often, never tried it - OMG is this good!!;..
2;WAYYYYYY TOO SWEET;If you are looking for a sugar high, then these are what you are looking for. Too sweet for me and my family, I don't think we will be ordering these again.
5;Great & Nutty Treat ;
2;not oil cured;"There is a way to ""oil cure"" olives, and once done, the result is a lightly salted, meaty olive that still has a lot of flesh. This isn't that olive."
5;A step in the right perfection;5:45 a.m.
5;Great Italian dressing, also a great marinade;We've been using Ken's dressings for some time now, expanding to try new ones as they become available in our area.  check around locally as shipping costs can make these heavy items often more expensive to ship, I love it when Amazon picks them up and fulfills them directly.
5;Boyer's Rocky Mountain Thunder Coffee Beans (40-Ounce Bag);Boyer's Rocky Mountain Thunder Has a Bold and rich flavor.<br />It's a dark roasted coffee bean.
5;Tasty dried berries.;Bought these twice now. Are really good and good for you.
5;Best deal I can find;This is the best deal I can find over the web. The bags are pretty long compared with other brands I bought before.
5;Tiger loves the Gourmet cat treats.;Tiger loves this grass..
4;Wonderful Treat!;These treats are great!  They smell wonderful and my dogs love them!  They are also very healthy and great for my dog who is a little over weight as they are low calorie.  The seller was excellent and the treats got here much faster than what was originally estimated.
5;Garden Of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips;Corn chips, you can't have just one and therein lies the problem. The crunch, the salt, the flavors are so addictive.
5;Excellent service;The product was received as advertised----ahead of schedule.  It was just as advertised.
4;coffee pod;trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent.
5;Stash Premium Christmas Eve Herbal Tea = :);This is some seriously refreshing tea and since I received my box, I have been consuming three cups a day.  It is delicious and makes me smile.
5;Perfect for Iced Coffee;"These packets are very good with coffee.  While trying to make ""skinnier"" iced coffee I tried the Caramel and the French Vanilla, and those flavors with a bit of fat free milk made excellent ""skinny"" iced coffee."
5;My dogs love, love, love these treats;Both my Westie and Yorkie can't get enough of these treats.  Casper(westie) has allergies and so I look for treats that will enhance the special diet I feed him.
2;Must have gotten a bad batch :(;I must have gotten a bad batch, Both the roast and the cup quality were poor.<br />2/10 cups so far have failed and dumped grounds into my cup.
5;It IS low in Calories! And Delicious!;Absolutely delicious. I prefer this over the chicken curry and butter chicken packages because all a few minutes on the stove prepares this as compared to ~20 with those other ones.
4;tea time;Tea samples came with the Keureg brewer, and when I tried them I was pleasantly surprised.<br />They surpass anything in a tea bag and when I want a warm drink at night, the decaf tastes excellent too.
5;Popcorn;Northern Popcorn has the best flavor in town!!! I've ordered Northern Popcorn for my business and home on a few occassions and will continue to go back.  They have the best tasting popcorn and the prices are great as well.
5;Excellent product, just not cheap!;12 fluid ounces of this stuff for $8.99 a pop is about the only negative I could find with this outstanding substitute for the long discontinued Knott's Berry Farm variety.
5;dogs,too,are what they eat;we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly.
5;Excellent!;This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.
2;Zebra dsi skin;It is very cute. Once I put it in I had to take it off and take a hole puncher to a few spots bc it wouldn't fit exactly but it was close.
5;Better than process white sugar;As far as going natural this is very good, it is a lot sweeter than the processed white sugar that is on the market. This is the only sugar that I buy.
1;Head to the drug store and buy some pretzels. You'll be better off.;The presentation is top notch but the quantity and selection of treats is awful. I gave this and a Ferrero Rocher 48 Piece gift box to somebody.
4;If you like Stoned Wheat Thins from Canada...;..
2;Whole Grain, But No Cheddar Flavor To It!;"I like the fact that this popcorn is 100% whole grain, but don't buy it for the ""Cheddar Cheese"" flavor, because there is none.  It tastes like regular, very salty, popcorn to me."
2;not everything that smells delicious usually tastes as such;"I usually make my own ginger-lemon tea, most often to keep colds at bay (as per the recommendation of Kimberly Snyder in <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;Bad Batch?;Don't know if I just got a bad batch or something, but the package I received had such a strong chemical smell, and my dog seemed to like them okay at first, but then was drinking water like crazy, and puked it back up a few hours later..
2;Tea Wonderful, Tins Dinged Up;Tea is wonderful
5;awesome;I had these growing up, I'm 39 and had them since I was 11. They are the best in the world.
5;LOVE IT;Purchased for my organic eatting toddler.  HE LOVES THEM.
5;I wanna go to the Madhouse;These might possibly be the best chips ever.<br /><br />The bad news is that we can't keep them in the house.
5;Cat Food;Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits with Beef in Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)is great.
5;Good for the Boston;I have a 4 year old, 20 lbs Boston Terrier male.  Little man was entertained for almost 2 hours with the treat ball.
1;Flavorless;I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.
5;Spicy Cashews are Tasty and Addictive, but a bit too Salty;These are good, excellent flavor, quite fresh out of the package, but a little too salty for my taste.  Not much to add, except to note that once you taste a few of these pepper and salt coated cashews, you want more of them.
5;Good Intro to Brand and Product Line;Great sampler packet. I have tried other brands of ready to eat Indian foods such as Jyoti and Tasty Bite.
2;Too much sugar, too expensive;The Switch Orange Tangerine sounded delicious when I ordered it. I thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days.
5;Light, Tasty, Refreshing;This is my go-to tea right now.  It's fragrant, delicate, sweet and delicious.
4;Teaposy;I had never seen a Teaposy tea blossom before so I really had no idea what to expect when I took it out of the package. It looked like a large, oddly shaped pellet of sorts that was rolled up tight with one end that was tightly tied with a strip of tea leaf.
5;Great Ingredients;I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry..
3;Freddy Krueger, I've got your hand;Although my cat will play with this, I wouldn't recommend you purchase it.  The size is way big for me yet too small for my boyfriend, so it's difficult to manipulate comfortably.
1;Yuck! Terrible.;Really not what I was expecting - sorry.  I know many liked it, I just didn't - one man's opinion.
1;Horrible Texture!!!;I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks.
5;Wonderful Treats for training;Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day.
5;A little bit of chocolate heaven ...;Wow!  As an unrepentant chocoholic, I'm always looking for great yummy chocolate treats.  Unfortunately, there IS a downside: too much of a good thing can lead to less than desirable results, especially on the scale.
5;The best ever,;Great condiment for my latin american dishes.  Unable to find it lately in the supermarkets.
5;Great;My dogs have loved this product for 22+ Years. Not my main source of nutrition for them but a nice treat.
5;5 Hour Energy;5 Hour Energy is great, one of the few energy drinks/shots that I find to work on me. Great when you need to do a lot of things during the day.
5;I found out these were a lot cheaper to buy in the store!!!!;I was really bummed to find out these were in the store for about $2 cheaper.  They are awesome and give you your chocolate fix and in a healthy way, but I wouldn't buy them online.
5;Excellent Fiber for Smoothies!;The healthy fiber in fruit is often lost when processed. Therefore I use this product to boost the fiber in my smoothies and retain the health benefits.
5;ThinAddicitves are really addictive.;The first package was given to us by our son and my husband did become addicted.  He asked me to find them, so I naturally turned to Amazon and ordered them for him.
1;Foulest, stalest coffee imaginable;I have been drinking espresso for many years, some of which was appalling, and without a doubt this sample of Eight O'Clock via Amazon is the most disgusting. It smelt weird in the bag and when brewed revealed it was months past its roasting date and from the bitterest beans available.
1;Beware of expiration date...;I'm sure this has the potential to be really good. But, here it is April of 2012 and the package I received today expired in March of 2010.
1;"NOT ""Pure Matcha Green Tea""";The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder.  There is no mention of sugar in the contents.
1;Not at all happy with this;I would give this a zero star if I could. It's terrible.
3;Nothing Special;I wasn't really expecting magnificence, just something different. But I hate to say that these cookies don't taste much different than the generic butter cookies you've been getting at your local grocery store for decades .
5;fabulous!!!;I absolutely love this iced coffee!  I have been trying to make my own iced coffee at home for years and always give in to the drive thru's instead because I can't get it right.  Not only does this taste better than the drive thru places, it is also cheaper!  I am totally hooked.
5;pasta;Hard to find product outside urban areas.  happy it was available on Amazon.
5;FOR THE MOM ON THE GO...;I absoutly love these things!! And so does my 13 month old..
5;Aromatic and dellcious;This was a great addition for our Tassimo and the whole family loves it.  Excellent quality, flavor and aroma.
5;Great coffee.;This is an excellent (in my opinion) rich, dark coffee.  Not for the timid drinker but as full a flavor as I have had the pleasure to drink.
5;Delicious multi-grain bread;Although all of the Hodgson bread mixes we have tried are good, this is one of our favorites.  It has a wholesome, hearty flavor and the aroma while it is baking .
5;Nice salt in my grinder;Maybe it's a psychological thang but it seems to have a nice salty mineral flavor without being tooo aggressive.  I like to use it in a grinder and use to finish off my steaks and roasts.
2;not what i expected;I bought this tea after reading all of the glowing reviews saying no other tea compared. I was actually excited for the tea to get to my house as I've been looking for a good tea to take on the go for classes.
5;Crunchy, salty, sweet...finally, a Superbowl snack that scooores!;These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.
4;Healthy, Tasty Low-Cal Snack;This coconut chia bar makes a wonderful portable snack. Unlike like some health-type bars, its not so sticky that you can't handle it without making a sticky mess on everything
5;Great Source for Xylitol;Xylitol isn't cheap, so I was very glad to find this 5lb bag.  The bag has a ziplock top, which works with coaxing.
4;Fun drink for a cold day;I can't tell you it taste like coffee, not even sure it taste like pumpkin spice, but I really like it.<br />It's foamy, flavorful and thick.
4;great alternative to traditional peanut butter!;I love how this has a lot less fat and it's not processed as much as regular store bought peanut butter is. I like being able to make it as thick or soupy as I want.
5;CALM By Natural Vitality****A Must Have For Anyone!!!!!!****;I love this stuff!!!!!!! It works quickly, efficiently and tastes good too. It works for headaches, stress, mental disorders like Schizophrenia, ect.
5;Most popular flavor;I supply a group that drinks a lot of coffee 7 different flavors of individual-serving creamers each week and this is by far the most popular flavor. I've actually seen people use 2 in a 6 oz.
5;Have You Tried It Iced?;My favorite is the Italian Roast.  I never liked 'instant' until I tried this.
5;Healthy dog food!;We have 5 dogs and they all love this food.I's not over processed and it has good ingredients so we will keep using it.
5;yummyy!!!!!;it's really good!!! i've had so many types of granola bars before, thinking they'd keep me full, but always realizing they're full of empty cals.  this one tastes quite similar to a candy bar, but keeps me going the whole day!<br /><br />the caramel roll is deadly sticky, has a little chalky feel to it, prob because of the soy protein isolate added, and the crispy exterior makes it dangerous for the roof of your mouth (first time i ate it i scraped so much skin off the roof, i was chewing it into my food-- gross!)<br /><br />BUT: not too sweet, tastes decent, keeps you full for hours, travels well.
5;Delicious!;This tea is like having a slice of pumpkin pie without the guilt or calories ..
4;YUMMY;These cheddar bunnies are delicious and just the right size for my 1 year old to snack on.  He loves them.
5;Peaches Galore!;I live on/off in Europe and eat Haribo all the time.  However, coming back to the States, I can't find it, locally.
5;Excellent product, but expensive due to the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. I expect the price to go back down in a few years.;Awesome packaging, I just wish, for the price, it came with a small measuring spoon. But, oh well.
5;Excellent Product;The black cherry concentrate makes a very nice drink..
3;Date-filled cookies;This was a gift for my father, while he was in a temporary nursing home, which he shared with the others in the home. It was a success.
4;Santa's White Christmas coffee;The coffee was very good. I gave it to my coworker as a gift within a week she said it was gone.
5;these are awesome!!;Love chips but don't love the fat, calories, or grease.  These are a great alternative for people who like something crunchy, like a chip, but want a little more health.
5;Best Coffee Ever;This is the best coffee you will ever taste.  Prepared properly, it offers a smooth brew, with no acidic edge.
4;Tasty, but expensive;I found these to be pretty tasty, but for the price, I'd rather buy dips that are already made or make it myself.  If you are very into organic and can't find things locally, then this product is for you.
5;Easy Way To Feed Baby!;Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees in Juicy Pear and Garden Greens makes a great meal for my daughter when we're on-the-go.  I tried a pouch myself, and it's tasty to me, for baby food, and my daughter really likes it as well.
5;Best Protein Bar I've Ever Had;This is the best tasting protein bar I've ever had. In fact, its the only protein bar I've ever liked.
5;Excellent coffee - But what's the deal with the price?;For my taste this tops them all.  I just can't get over the Amazon price!  The 18 cup box from Target is $9.
5;After a month, I am a believer;I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past.
4;A great, light coffee;For coffee lovers, this is a great idea for quick coffee on the go. These pods are meant to be used for a single serving in a coffee maker
5;great bags;Like these poop bags because they are pretty durable and they claim to be biodegradable. Will buy again.
5;ITS RETRO;ITS RETRO ITS BLACK JACK GUM WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY..
4;excellent coffee at a great price;I've been using this coffee for some time, and I use it for my regular coffee. not just espresso.
3;I had an allergic reaction to this shampoo;I purchased this shampoo about 2 weeks ago, and used it for the first time last weekend.  After using it in the shower, I noticed that my forehead and temples were blotchy red, clearly an allergic reaction.
3;Energy Bar Has Never Tasted This Great!;Snickers Marathon Long-Lasting Energy bar promises to give gym enthusiasts long lasting energy which is rarely found in most chocolate bars. It is typical to find lots of carbohydrates and fats in these chocolate bars, especially for Mars chocolate products, but long lasting energy? Isn't this just a fad?<br /><br />I have enjoyed Snicker products ever since I was a child.
1;golden valley natural black pepper turkey jerky;I am completely upset that our order of turkey jerky is MOLDY!  The expiration date is September so it should have been good.  So obviously I cannot recommend this product.
5;Exceptional Cat Food!;Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.
2;I S.....T H E.....C R A B......H I D I N G ??????;The PICTURE for this item, (and even the wording below it), proudly proclaim, (in BIG letters), 'BLUE CRAB BAY CO., CHESAPEAKE CRAB CAKE MIX, 2--OUNCE PACKAGE, (PACK OF 6).
1;Contains garlic powder;These would be fine training treats for dogs that aren't allergic to wheat except that they contain garlic powder. I won't risk feeding my dog a treat that could cause anemia.
5;Coffee has new meaning for me;I bought the Bosch Tassimo T-Disc single cup coffee and beverage maker (chocolate, teas, etc.) I am so pleased with this system.
5;I &lt;
5;YUM;For those of you that have never tried spiedies (which is most anyone that is NOT from the Endicott, NY area), you should do yourself a favor and use Salamida's Spiedie Marinade.  Cut up some chicken into chunks, marinade for 48 hours and bbq on skewers.
5;Two thumbs up;My husband eats these every day and thus we go through one bag very quickly. It's very convenient to order them in this six pack - plus the shipping is free since six of the bags costs more than $25 (threshhold above which shipping is free).
1;Yuck!;These Jordan almonds were horrible.  They were mushy and the coating was about half an inch thick.
2;Disappointed;I bought a 2 lb. bag directly from the factory in Fairfield, CA not from Amazon so I don't know if there might be quality or freshness differences.
1;Love Jyoti, but didn't like this flavour at all;We love Jyoti products, but this one didn't taste very good, smelled weird, and was really soupy/sloopy.  The only Jyoti product we just didn't like.
5;PEPPERIDGE FARM GOLDFISH CHOCOLATE GRAHAM CRACKERS(PACK OF 8);A delicious great tasting product by Pepperidge Farm that normally cost you $2.49 per bag, sometimes on sale at the supermarket 2 for $4.
1;Undrinkable!;"This was recommended by a sweet-young-thing at a local store who thought it would be a mild coffee that I would enjoy since it says ""medium roast"".  It is a black, bitter brew more on the order of something that has been sitting all day on a back burner at a greasy spoon hamburger joint."
3;Pod Brewing - Bleh;
4;Good hair product. . . IF USED CORRECTLY!;Perhaps the only real fault of this product is lack of clear instructions on HOW TO USE IT.  I'm familiar with this type of hair care product, so I knew the one simple truth that helps make it wonderful: Use just enough to coat your hair in one layer.
5;Great product and BPA-FREE!;I had been using Muir Glen Organic whole/diced tomatoes, but after having had cancer I read a lot of research publications indicating that BPA's estrogen mimicking effects can be quite dangerous. BPA found in cans with acidic foods are some of the worst since the chemical is leached out even more.
2;Sugar Free Assorted Fruit Gummy Bears;The sender did a lousy job.<br />Came in a flat envelope and candies were mashed into a lup.
5;"""Beyond Customer Service""";"Brian, you are an excellent representation of your company. Your customer service is ""Outstanding."
3;Disgusting?;I didn't know it will have such a fishy flavor, I think I've wasted my money on this one.<br /><br />I think I was looking for chile/curry paste, I guess I should have looked at the ingredients.
5;Perfect as snack or dinner;I like taste this tea, with biscuit, cheese an apple. Perfect combination for a light dinner or snack in the afternoon.
5;good stuff;I love this smooth tasting tea. I think that regular consumpion helped me to fight off colds because once I ran out  ,I got a cold, it works for me.
4;its dog food;What can I say.  Its dog food and the dog cobbles it up.
5;ONE OF MY CATS FAVORITE FLAVORS OF WELLNESS;I HAVE NINE CATS WHO EAT NOTHING BUT WELLNESS CANNED CAT FOOD. TURKEY IS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE FLAVORS.
5;Best Holiday Flavor;The flavor is perfect and a nice afternoon treat. I don't go to Starbucks for the holiday lattes anymore.
5;Great Coffee!!;I really hoped for the best on this one after becoming disillusioned with my local coffee shop's organic ethically produced Ethiopian offering, but happily this is a great tasting cup of coffee. My husband orders these specifically to take with him to work.
1;Worst Tasting Syrup Ever;This was sugar free Cherry syrup which you can put on snow cone or shaved ice this was the worst tasting thing I ever tried. We pitched it don't waste your money.
5;Yummiest & Freshest Cookies;Caveman Bakery has made the best tasting, yummiest, freshest gluten free, high protein cookies!  Plus they are lower in calories than most cookies.  They do indeed taste old fashioned.
5;Better than my other favorite..Starbucks;This is my favorite of all of the bold coffees. No bitterness at all.
5;Good Service, Good Candy;I bought the candy as a gift and needed fast delivery. Everything was delivered as promised.
5;A necessity for GF Baking... The BEST;As a newly diagnosed celiac I have tried many GF products available. All are fairly expensive and aren't always delicious.
4;Quick Disappearing Bone;My dog chewed it up & made it disappear in about 5 minutes, while I was emptying the box. He definitely likes it but its a little costly to go so fast.
5;Best rice ever;I learned to eat this rice when I was stationed in Hawaii.  The kind of long grain rice you buy in the grocery pales in comparison.
1;Stale Nuts;The almonds I received from the Bergin Nut Company were stale.  I ate some and ended up throwing the remainder and the second bag in the trash.
3;Outdated cans?;I have been feeding this food to my cats for several years, and I recently a started buying them online from Amazon for the convenience (though the price is about the same as what I pay at my local grocery store).  The strange thing I've noticed is that since I started getting it from Amazon, they have been vomiting quite frequently after feeding them a can.
5;amazing...;"Manna is an appropriate way to describe this beautiful, pure and divine concoction, made purely and simply from coconut ""meat."" It literally melts in your mouth."
5;Too Good;This jerky sent my husband into joyful MMMMM's.  He was afraid he might not get any more, so he voluntarily rationed the package to last as long as he could--one month.
1;Holy cow... atrocious;Needlessly complex directions? check.<br />Directions laid out poorly on box so that you jump from step 1 to step 3? check.
5;A great cup of coffee;Delicious cup of coffee anytime without the waste of making a full pot.  After searching other sites, found that Amazon.
5;Amazing and flavorful Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds;"I am so thankful that Amazon has these wonderful almonds! Our WalMarts used to carry them and made a big mistake discontinuing them. There are six people in my office alone that LOVE these Jalapeno almonds and we have looked everywhere for them! I hope we will always be able to find them here!<a href=""http://www."
5;There are no better Madelenes;Donsuemor's Madeleines are absolutely delicious.  The company's customer service is very friendly and helpful.
3;Taste the Wilderness?;I did not taste the wilderness, as the package said. They just tasted like chocolate covered raisins.
5;Great value on some great nuts;I love cashews, and while I typically get them for $15 a pound at the mall's chocolate and nut shop, I decided to try these.  They ended up being a wonderful investment - excellent crisp nuts with good flavor.
4;gduct;i'm a big fan of asian cooking, and enjoy experimenting with various types of noodles for various meals (soups, stir fry, etc.).
5;Love this when I'm sick;This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it.
4;Good mini Bites;If you like Chef Boyardee then you'll like this canned product. Fair price, quick delivery and stock my pantry.
2;Powerful punch;Wow, these chips bite back. I loves me some salt and pepper potato chips, but these have little bit too much spice for my liking.
4;Chicken-in-a-can, not bad at all;I got tired of tuna fish, so decided to try the chicken for a change of pace. It's surprisingly good, and real handy to have around for sandwiches or casseroles.
5;Amazing Tea;I bought this tea for my mom for her birthday, and everyone in the family loves it. This is excellent chai tea.
5;an excellant cold Cappuccino coffee;the illy Cappuccino cold coffee has a very unique taste, compared to the Starbucks cold can of cappuccino, the illy brand is a bit smoother, not quite as strong or bitter as the Starbucks brand.  The flavor of the illy brand reminds me for some reason of a mountain cabin in Colorado, the smell of the coffee is very pleasant and not overpowering.
5;Yummy!;These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time.
5;Great Snack!;Great product, would definitely order again. Great in salads too! The price was great too.
4;A very nice beverage but it could be stronger for me;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:50 Mins<br /><br /></span>I thought that a video review of this beverage might but fun.  I liked the drink but it really didn't have that strong, rich, coffee flavor that I was looking for."
3;Onion-Garlic Dry Roasted Soy Nuts -- OK, but not great!;"I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion-Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more ""toasted"" than they were."
5;This is the best FAT FREE mix.;This is a really flavorful, moist, muffin mix.  I like it better and it<br />is more moist when made in a bread loaf pan.
5;Biggest, best Beef Jerky ever!;This is such a delicious bag of Peppered Beef Jerky. I love having a big bag of it to snack on whenever I feel like it.
5;No more tossing and turning!!!;I've had sleeping problems for years now and nothings really worked.  I refuse to try Ambien or any prescription drugs for fear of side effects.
5;Great Mushrooms!;These mushrooms are wonderful!  They taste rich and woodsy, and add real complexity to soups, stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />Dried mushrooms don't weigh much, so you will find your order may be larger than you expect.
5;Pumpkin for Dogs diet shortage - Saved by this product!;This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year-long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great.
3;Too much of a bite for me.;I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.
5;5 hour energy works;I was skeptical trying 5 hour energy as a regular source of an extra boost, but i really like it! It is good because it gives you energy and vitamins without the jitters. You can actually focus better without side effects (in my experience).
5;12 Culinary Herb Assortment;Have only planted a couple so can't give a total report, however the chives, basil have sprouted and are coming along.  Service was prompt so am happy with my purchase.
4;Healthy, Crunchy, Tasty, Great!;These mango chips are quite yummy.  They're a MUCH healthier alternative to potato chips, plus they taste great.
4;Yummy!;These are good. I like that they are organic, and my 2 year old loves them.
5;The Original;I've been drinking Two Leaves and a Bud ever since a friend gave me a box to try a couple months back. I haven't bothered with other teas after that.
5;Great crunch and not too oily;It seems that  a little oil is necessary to get the flavor correct in shoestring potatoes.  Cracklesnax gets the combination just right every time.
4;Different & tasty;I love these chips - rather have more beets than sweets.  Hard to find in my rural area - but do love them.
3;Not sure it's worth the trouble;My little dog (a Shih Tzu) seemed to have trouble licking the rollerball consistently enough to fully enjoy the treat.  Her inclination was to try to bite the top - and I'm wondering if that's what most dogs would try to do.
4;Keeps me on track;I love this product, it helps keep things moving!  I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting.  A great product for helping maintain your weight.
5;Decadent and calorie free!;"I haven't had coffee for most of my life, until I was introduced to this syrup instead of sugar. I am allergic to many foods, so I have precious few ""sweet treats""- I wake to this every morning! It is smooth and not too sweet"
5;Very good chocolates;Every chocolate manufacturer will have a chocolate that can go with every season and satisfy the taste buds of all generations. Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion.
5;Yummy;Great flavor to add to your coffee.  Not to bland , but not too sweet.
5;Tully's House Decaf;"Really smooth and mild. Great for the older folks that come to visit that do not want a ""rough"" cup of coffee."
5;BEST TEA... however pricing is too high on amazon;I love this tea and have been drinking this for last 5 years. But I always get it from TRADER JOES.
1;What U see, Is NOT what U get;"I ordered these because I love them and can't find them in stores. Well, I found out they dont make them anymore, and I was sent a ""substitute""."
5;Hands down my favorite tea!;"I've been ""addicted"" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea."
5;Hazelnut Milka is Delicious;Milka and its famous purple cow, recently purchased by Kraft, is an eastern European chocolate originally produced in Switzerland and is available in Germany, Austria, Hungary and other nearby countries. With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.
4;Heavy Water;"i must admit that the best I can describe this water is ""heavy water"" as it has a bit of a ""heavy"" taste (perhaps due to a high pH) compared to other water.  I cannot notice any differences of it helping me."
5;Great Tea, bad pacakging - use something else to store this tea.;Stash tea is a new favorite brand.  Good flavor, good quality, lots of flavor options.
5;HONESTLY Wonderful;I have to admit I never tasted Granola before in my 63 years. But after a heart attack I had spent the past 2-3 years as an avid juicer, plus bought a Vitamix & use it faithfully as well.
5;She loved them!;Bought these for my kid sister who lives far away (really, who needs more toys, so I went with a healthy treat instead). Awesome that Amazon can send her a treat from big sis on a regular basis and not charge me shipping!<br /><br />She loved them! Drinks them for school lunch and snacks and at home.
3;Plant looked kind of like the photo;Arrived today usps..
4;The best of dry, but dry may not be enough.;My cats have eaten Evo dry for several years, and I've always taken pride in their energy and shiny coats. Sometime last year, however, I watched my large male cat's health start to decline.
5;The Good Stuff;Our two dogs love the by Nature canned food, and why wouldn't they? It's almost entirely composed of chicken, and they both love chicken. I'm not a total convert to the all meat diet, so we mix the canned food with some dry food by the same company that contains some oat, flaxseed, and alfalfa in addition to the meat protein component.
1;Not worth the price;The price of this cat food is far above the value.  Fifty percent ot my cats did not like it.
5;OVER PRICED KEEP LOOKING;I love Jelly Belly's but this bag is 2 pounds, with 49 flavors, for $21.60, and just a little further down the page is the same bag, 2 lbs,  49 flavors, still from JELLY BELLY, and it's only $16.
5;Brilliant flavor;
4;noodles;"These come packed in water and although zero calories (black ones are 10, it does have ""filling"" qualities.<br /><br />Good source of ""cheap"" fiber."
5;Amazing food!;Feeding 2 cats twice a day is made so simple with this bigger can.  I just give each half!  I give them Tiki Cat, which they adore, but I wanted to try this one because of the good deal.
5;Excellent!;Creme de la creme of sea salt. Great taste and I love the color!<br />Perfect size granules to use for a table or cooking salt.
5;great value;It's very hard to find this product, at all, in the store. This was a great find and a great deal.
5;The only bully stick  worth buying;I have a lab mix who gets bored really easily. She's fussy with treats and wont touch rawhide.
5;TASTY!!;Very tender meats. Sole is awesome! Good value.
5;Very distinctive tea, one of my favorites;This tea has an extremely smokey flavor that has been compared to a campfire. It's much stronger than normal tea.
5;Tasty, unique, well-balanced candy;I have tasted Bali's Best Iced Tea candy and found the flavors spot on (just like a cup of a sweet tea) and very tasty. Since they did such a good job on that candy, I decided to try their Green Tea Latte candy since I enjoy green tea as well.
5;Wow! talk about authenic flavor!;Great stuff,  I could never duplicate this flavor at home even if I had the ingredients.<br />Bought this sauce packet couple months back, it was the only one of the shelf.
5;great northern popcorn;It is the perfect size portion pack for my new popcorn popper.<br />Tastes just like movie theater popcorn.
3;Relatively healthy but bland;As far as spaetzle goes, this is pretty blah. It's just made of flour and spinach, nothing else, so it is low in sugar, salt, and cholesterol-free (no eggs).
5;Best bar I've tasted in a long time!;I received one of these free with another purchase.  Mine was fresh and delicious.
4;Natural dog biscuits without wheat ingredient;Our two labs love Cinna-bone Biscuits. I refuse to purchase dog food products that contain wheat so this Solid Gold products meets my test of a more natural product.
5;great cereal great value;My family, including my 7 year old, absolutely love Kellogg's Smart Start.<br />It is a great, healthy, cereal.
1;Kind service but. Terribly old product.;Returned the product. It was old, stale, hard and not edible for my dogs to even (bite thru) to eat.
5;De-Licious with perfect packaging;Leibniz cookies are truly my favorite, beyond what I make, I am a passionate cook. The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture.
5;vanilla beans;this was my first time purchasing vanilla beans and I was very pleased with them.  I bought them to make homemade vanilla and it turned out wonderfully.
4;To jazz up the kibble;I have this on automatic shipping once a month.  It's great to have a case of dog food on hand to jazz up the kibble.
4;Decent;I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, but I will eat it if I need to make something quickly and cheaply. This flavor is actually pretty good, although I wouldn't suggest eating it too often because of the amount of sodium.
2;Watery and artificial tasting;Tastes like chocolate water with artificial sweetener.  Really not worth drinking.
2;Decent, but not great;When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore.
5;K-cups;I love my Keurig coffee maker.  I like the different coffee flavors and the easy way of just making one cup at a time.
5;Starbuck and K-Cups;The title says it all!  Starbucks in K-Cups, what could be better.  Sumatra is one of my favorites and the taste is every bit as good as whole bean freshly ground.
3;Flavored coffe smells great;Aroma is super, but flavor is lacking.  This is better when creamer and sweetener are added to bring out the flavor which tends to wash out.
5;McCormicks Is Great;As stated in the title, McCormick has great products and these bay leaves are no exception.<br /><br />Fragrant, aromatic and organic!<br /><br />I've been using them in spaghetti sauce and bean dishes and they certainly help make them tasty.
3;Vino Italiano Reisling;Have made lots of kits over the years, I am more of a red wine enthusiast. Didn't enjoy this wine initially, am letting it age more then will re-post.
5;A little bit of heaven every a.m.;It doesn't get any better than this in the a.m.
5;This was a big hit!;I sent these kits to my kids in college a few weeks before Christmas. They put them together with a bunch of friends.
5;Tastes great!;I love these granola bars!  Even though the gluten free market is growing, it is still not always easy to find things that taste good. This brand is really good.
5;Great tasting cofffee;I was a bit hesitant on buying Folgers coffee since I associate the name with the cheap Folgers coffee that my parents drink. I was surprised how good this coffee tastes and is comparable to Starbucks.
4;cute packaging if you put it all together;I bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor, one on each side. It makes a cute little colorful box, nice to give as a gift if you put it together.
5;funny dogs;The box arrived and my dogs (I have 4) started dancing around the box like a kid infront of a christmas present-quite funny..
1;Not clear advertising - just flavored apple in Variety pack!;This is for the variety pack. The good: it is all organic and contains no sugar, the taste is quite good.
5;amazing;best smelling vanilla beans ever. the aroma is so pronounced it has infiltrated my pantry with the most wonderful vanilla smell.
5;Favorite Tassimo Coffee Blend;I believe I have tried all the coffee T-Discs for the Tassimo.  The Maxwell French Roast hands down is my favorite.
3;Not my favorite flavored coffee;I'm not sure why, but I do not like this as much as some other flavored coffees.  The flavor is very  noticeable, but it does not remind me of vanilla the way I would like.
3;product is good service is non existant;The product came with a crushed box but was OK condition. I called the Air shop for advice on other products and on what I purchased.
2;Wilton Frosting;The frosting did not taste very good, but it decorates well because it is stiff. I suggest you make your own if you care about taste more than appearance.
5;Great snack for kids!;What a great playdate snack!  These things disappear so very fast, it's just unbelievable!  Can't really recommend them enough - the kids can't get anough of them.  The tropical is the least favorite, but hey, mom and dad get those!  It's so much fun to see the kids eat these things - it's pretty funny! They taste amazing, much better than I thought after those nasty things we had in the 70s.
5;LOVE these crackers!;After reading Wheatbelly (from Amazon), I've finally come to terms with the need to go really low-carb and avoid grains. But what to do about the need to snack and dip occasionally? These fit the bill perfectly: spicy, crunchy, healthy and gluten-free.
4;Tah-dah Tea;My first experience with Twinings English Afternoon Tea..
3;salt?;I didn't realize there would be no salt--it's quite like eating cardboard. I enjoy the flavor of grain, so I can eat it, but I have to perk it up.
3;Mostly Maple;Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was expecting this to have a more complex flavor than coffee and maple syrup. While it certainly smells wonderful, the flavor is pretty much weak coffee with a touch of maple.
4;Delivered without a problem;My order was filled and the product was delivered quickly, as promised.  The gum was kind of crunchy at first, though it is not outdated, so I don't think it could be stale - just a little strange.
5;More theobromine, no blender required!;"Ibarra is made with ground cacao nibs (""cacao paste""), not processed chocolate powder, so there is much more theobromine in it than in other chocolate products. If you are looking for a chocolate high, this is the product for you! You don't need a blender either."
5;GREAT!!!;My mom and I both have Celiac and truly love Pamela's Products. We have been using her Baking and Pancake mix for the past year, and were ecstatic to snag this one (not available in any stores near us).
5;The original are back!;So happy to see these nasty little candies are back- my kids were soo disappointed last year when all we could find were the knock-offs. Nothing gets by my Harry Potter fans! The boxes are quite small, so yes- this is expensive for a few jelly beans.
1;Better off with a dollar chocolate bar;The main ingredient in chocolate is not shortening,but it is in these.They have a vary poor chocolate flavor, and an even worse texture(tastes like eating grease).
3;I thought I'd found a BBQ sauce for life!;Latest Update 8/15/2012:<br /><br />I wrote a note to Kraft extolling the virtues of their great decision to keep HFCS out of their sauce.<br />Well, I got a note back saying this:<br /><br />Thank you for visiting [.
2;Very Messy;I was hopefully that since this was a mixed food combo it would be thicker in consistency - WRONG! It was like straight water. It made such a messy.
2;Too Sweet;I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product).
5;Blue is Better;"I had tried Terra ""Red Bliss"" olive oil, garlic and parmesan chips and was looking to get more when I stumbled onto the Blue chips, and they were on sale!  So I decided to try them and what a wonderful suprise to me and my picky family.  My Husband commented that ""these taste like pure potatoes""."
5;cameron's organic coffee;I ordered and tried this brand of coffee for the first time today.  It's pretty good.
5;Delicious;This syrup is delicious.  I made prickly pear cactus margaritas with the recipe that came with the bottle and they were yummy too.
5;Got it, like it, good!;I had this at a local Christian Men's Fish Fry seminar. Had to find out what it was that made the fish taste so wonderful.
5;Treats;Our little guy eats one of these a day after dinner.  he sits and waits until they are given.
5;Great for Traveling;A strawberry mish mash and some other fruit combination too. I buy these from Safeway whenever they have it on sale.
5;Our Triplets Love It! Very Affordable.;My wife and I are parents to 9 month old spontaneous triplets. We originally were buying another brand of organic formula (major brand at Target with green lid) prior to giving this brand a try.
5;Love this coffee;This coffee is the best tasting and highest-quality you can get for the price.  It's difficult to find in my area's stores and when I can find it, it's very over-priced.
5;Excellent Coffee & Great Amazon Deal!;Not only is this some very tasty coffee, Amazon offers it at a very good price.  I'm quite pleased with this purchase and can recommend it to others with no reservation.
5;Tea Time;I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.
5;Nice mild coffee that still delivers a morning kick...;My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.
5;The Good Stuff;This is some good hot sauce. Put it on just about anything! Mexican food, chili, eggs, sandwiches, pizza, chicken, burgers, fries, bbq, soups.
5;Girls go wild for Zuke's dog treats;"My two ""girls"" love these training treats.  I was looking for AKC liver training treats and couldn't find it for a while so I ordered these."
1;???Bugs ?;Not sure if these had larvae in them or if it came at my house in Hawaii. But I don't think i will buy these again.
5;Wild Rice Review;The Wild Rice package which included one from Minnesota and one from Canada..
5;Perfect Almonds, Great price !;Compared to what I pay at the normal grocery store for almonds, these are priced great, and taste fresh and crunchy. The sea salt taste is perfect, and the containers are conviently sized.
5;Great coffee;I am wary of celebrity chef endorsements for coffee, but I was wrong here..
4;good and gluten free;Since being diagnosed with a wheat allergy several years ago, I have been on a mission to find good tasting, wheat free baked goods.  This crust is very good, it just takes a little more milk than the recipe on the back calls for.
5;Natural Calm Magnesium;I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.
4;Great snack!;I tried this snack because it looked healthy, so I didn't expect it to be too great. I was wrong --- it is very very good! I'll buy more when my supply runs low.
2;Disappointing;I am jumping on the bandwagon with all of those reviewers who said this coffee is weak. I am disappointed that the Marley name is on this.
5;Family favorite for 10 years;It took 3 years of exhaustive taste testing :-) for the wife and I to find a salsa we both loved. The flavors, textures, heat and spices of this salsa were unmatched by any other.
5;Delicious with cream cheese.;I was hesitant about Pita chips, but my wife bought and a bag at a local store one day and let me taste it. I was hooked and haven't looked back since.
5;Wellness means top quality;We have tried a number of different Wellness dry dog mixes, and our Wheaten Terrier loves them all, but this one is his favorite. I love the fact that it isn't 90% grain, which most cheap and expensive dog foods seem to feel is great filler.
5;Just right;A lot better than those you can buy in typical US grocery. This smells and taste closest to shrimp.
5;My dogs love these.;These are sticks with ribs protruding.  I am going to use the same review I did for another ZOE product, because it is as true for this product as it was for the other one:<br /><br />I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.
2;Quick Chew;First the good news: the dogs really liked these.  Now the bad news: they are really more of a treat than a chew bone.
2;Can't speak to the vitamins but the taste isn't stellar;I didn't notice any change in energy
5;Excellent, Very Tasty. Love it!;Tasty. Very restaurant-like.
5;Snacks;Very tasty cookies. Good size portion for lunch pails or to take along.
3;Not the best coffee;There are other vanilla raspberry coffess available, although none sold by Amazon unfortunately. Try one of those.
4;diabetic sweets;good cake taste great but leaves me gassy.  birthday cake for my hubby.
1;Far too skinny;These bully sticks are probably the skinniest I have ever seen, we are talking pencil thin so of course my dog chewed them in about two seconds. For the price I paid I would really warn people off this brand as it is hard to find another brand with less bang for your buck.
2;No card was enclosed;I was not there to see the products but, the note to be enclosed and sent with the product saying who it was from (this was a gift) was absent. Therefore, it was received without knowledge of who or where it was sent from.
5;Excellent taste!;First, the chips arrived in perfect condition having been double-boxed by Amazon, with the outer box very sturdy.  I have share the chips with friends, and we all love them!  Very unique taste.
5;The Most Wonderful Dark Roast Coffee;The best dark roast coffee I've had. Intense, flavorful, robust coffee taste.
5;The Ultimate Gluten Free Pretzel!!;There is nothing that compares!! These are better than regular pretzels!! You can't eat just one!!  Thanks Amazon for giving celiacs or anyone that is on a gluten free diet a break in the price that is normally paid for these pretzels..
5;Best balance;At the downtown public market, the hot sauce speciality vendor (who has over a hundred types) recommended this as his favorite. He was correct.
1;Not Medium Roast, but Light Roast;I expected to receive medium roast coffee beans, but instead I received very light roast beans.  They were medium to light browns  in color.
4;Stinky but my dogs love it!;Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).
5;Delicious!;"This is a fantastic syrup, with wonderful flavor.  The price is great when you subscribe to the ""subscribe and save""."
4;Finally good black sugar free Licorice;This is the best sugar free black licorice I have found to date. This has a good strong licorice flavor up front with a good salt taste in the back of the flavor.
5;Great Sugar Free Drink Option;I am a big advocate of Crystal Light.  It's like Kool Aid without the sugar.
4;Great balanced meal for those on the go;I thought I was gettign a pack of 6 to review and share with family.  I only received one box.
5;Really nice product;"Aside from the fact that this product is so reasonably priced and that the delivery was very prompt (about 4 days before the estimated delivery date), it has a really nice flavor for being ""raw"". I had tried one other brand before and it was quite bitter tasting."
5;Great K-Cup Coffee;Quick delivery and we really like the bold, rich flavor of Green Mountain Dark Magic. This is the way to order K-Cup coffee.
4;Lotsa fruit;Excellent muesli. My two-year-old loves fruit, so this cereal (50% fruit) is a real hit.
5;A great way to wake up;After kicking a caffeine addiction I had nurtured for nearly 40 years, I was ready to find a tea that would not upset my stomach and that would help break through that groggy morning feeling.  Most teas make me a little nauseous or seem to fire up my heartburn not to mention their wake-up power was in caffeine still.
2;too expensive;I bought this gum because I recently quit smoking and when I got it I realized that I paid over 12 dollars for gum that should of only cost me 5 dollars. what a rip off.
5;Ridiculously Good;I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water.
4;Really like it;This is a great item if you're trying to increase your water intake and you don't like just water. It's helpful if you're trying to lose weight too, few if any calories.
3;Nothing Special;"Good Earl Grey Tea but nothing about it was special. The ""double bergamot"" went unoticed."
5;Packs a punch;This stuff is powerful! Be careful when you first use it. Not for lightweights but does the job.
5;Whoa!  My Dog REALLY Likes this Thing!;"When I received this ""Lickety Stik"", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it."
4;Didn't find it all that jazzy.;I have to admit that when I first tried this one I wasn't crazy about it.  It seemed lacking in flavor and richness to me compared to Green Mountain French Roast decaff, which is my favorite.
4;Can I have some more please?;A little too piquant but pleasantly pecanish. Overall these biscotti frustrate: when you realize you must not consume the entire package in one sitting.
5;Awesome deal!;My son didn't like his first taste of this, but once he got used to it he loved it.  Not sure how much better it is for him than the others, but the organic label got me to buy.
5;Good Product and Excellent Customer Service;At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.
5;Love this gum! Pain to find!;Great gum- and its one of the few without aspartame or potassium aspartate, instead it's made with Splenda! Flavor lasts a long time.  Sam's Club used to carry it but I guess it wasn't selling.
1;"Title should include ""For Dogs""";"I will admit that I overlooked the ""For Dogs"" part in the  tiny thumbnail picture but the title should include that important imformation. I bought this for my girlfriend and I and we are not dogs."
5;Husband loves this;My husband loves hot food.  We purchased this sauce and he is very happy with it.
5;Wow... Finally!!;I love this product and the others in this line of Sugar Free drink mixes!!<br />It is great for those who need to watch things like carbs..
3;Nicely made but not terribly effective;One of the more enjoyable (and important) aspects of the single malt experience is the nose. Whereas with wine, the nose can be complimentary or conflicting to its taste, scotch whisky tends to be mainly complimentary.
2;Definitely not for me...;I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.
5;chocolates are good and delivery superb;The chocolates are very good. I gave one box to my friend and she brought it to a party, every one there loved the chocolates.
5;Dog Loves Them, Price Increase?;Our dogs love Zukes and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  When I ordered these, they were the regular retail price, but I see now they are about 6 times more than that.
4;very good low calorie chips;best low calorie chip yet.  hard to tell that they are baked.
5;Lakerol;No sugar
5;yum yum cereal;great for me and great for the soldier in iraq.  use as a snack to take my pills in the evening.
5;great product for insomnia;This is a great product to help with insomnia.  Really great.
5;nice blend;My 7 month old really like this blend. It seems to me that you can taste corn better that squash in this combination, and it's more on the sweeter side- that's what babies like best.
4;A LOT of product for your $$$;You know those quart milk cartons?  That's what this is
2;Royalty Oaties Oat Biscuits;Cannot find out where these biscuits are manufactured!  Nothing stated on the package and no information that I could find available on the internet.  I will never buy again!!  Country where the food item is manufactured is essential consumer information.
5;Light and delicious;These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness..
5;Unique blend love the taste;I like the taste of Caribou coffees. I also had the Mahogany as well and like both flavors.
5;Great Chocolate Flavor;I used this to make some high quality chocolate ice cream using David Lebowitz recipes. The smell of the powder is beautiful and gives you an impression it will contribute wonderful flavors.
5;Best white gravy !;Nothing easier. Nothing better.
5;KIND;Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot.
5;Please get past the taste.;You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.
3;Blah - tastes baaad.;Pretty much tastes like dirt. I bought this based on a friends recommendation.
5;Everything you need is in this kit;This kit has everything you need to make a 5 gallon brew. It is also cheaper than buying it at your local brewing store.
5;Love;I have a very hard time finding this at my local pet stores..
5;Genova Tuna - excellent product, free shipping seals the deal;If you like tuna in oil, you will enjoy this product. Excellent taste, appearance and texture.
5;My Siberian kitten loves it;I have a Siberian kitten who is now 23 weeks old.  I brought her home when she was just 7 weeks old.
2;Tastes good, but watch the sorbital;I was eating these for breakfast for a few months, and noticed I was getting some digestive problems. They taste good, have good nutrition, but if you have a sensitive stomach, watch out! Sorbital can have ill effects on the digestive system.
5;Great three pack;This assortment was great.  The sauces are all a similar heat level, with slight increases in intensity.
5;Best Sauerkraut Available;I love this product. It's RAW, organic, and super delicious.
1;Did not impress our 3 dogs;We bought a small bag of Canidae to give it a try, as we are always trying new foods for our 3 dogs.  I normally serve 2 kinds of food for dinner and whenever we put Canidae in the dish, the dogs would always eat the other food first.
5;Super dog treats!;"Excellent quality dog treat for training.  Most dogs will view as a ""high value"" reward."
5;Good, but low quantity;The prices shown here are a little high compared to in-store costs, but if you can't find it then go for it. There's only about 26 pieces per box
5;My cat's loved it.;It's a huge jar. My cats thoroughly enjoy it.
5;Five Star;There's nothing like Starbucks for a morning pick me up. The very best.
5;Dove rocks;This from the Man in my life:<br />Dove's Bath Gel for Men, their recent entry into the growing male skin care market, is a sure winner. The aqua-colored gel instantly turns into a rich, foamy lather when it hits the washcloth.
5;Also Salt Is Great;AlsoSalt is the best salt substitute I have ever found.  We have shown it to our doctor and he approved that use of this product is ok.
1;I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed;After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.
4;Good tasting fake coffee;My wife can't have caffeine, so she really likes the hot beverage, Pero, in the morning. I think it tastes different, but flavorful.
3;unimpressed by flimsy chips;"I bought these chips because of all the positive reviews (and because they were cheap, with Amazon discounts), but I'm underwhelmed by both the Madhouse Munchies chip flavors I've purchased:  the Mesquite BBQ mentioned here, and the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Great if you like mangos and peaches.;What I really like about Mio:<br /><br />You control how much to add to your beverage.<br /><br />There is a lot less food coloring involved with a liquid delivery method than the powdered alternatives.
5;Vegan Organic Choice;Vegan. Organic.
4;BBQ Pop Chips;Great taste with no saturated or trans fat.  A little high priced though, but well worth it for controlling cholesterol.
4;best deal on Via;As a decaf drinker, it's nice to have packets of instant with me every where I go. It's also great to replace hotel room coffee, which is so bad I'd rather go without.
5;Wholesome and good...;If you like oatmeal cookies, you'll love this product.  The kids like to pack it in their lunchboxes, which is fine by me.
4;great taste and smell;My little one loves this a lot. It tastes and smells really good.
4;Yummy;I've always liked Nabisco Fig Newtons with the thick filling. These Newton Fruit Thins fit in to the Newton family of products well.
3;High in Sugar;This reduced fat peanut butter taste good, but probably because its so high in sugar.  I didn't realize the high sugar content and high fructose corn syrup until I received it.
5;Everyday;I have used this product everyday since purchasing (1.5 months).
5;Great Grain for a Healty Lifestyle;I was interested in this product for health reasons and was surprised at what a great flavor addition it was to my menu. This is a top shelf producer with a great history in Italy.
5;Great Flavor with a lot of heat;This hot sauce is quite spicy, with a nice rich flavor.  It isn't just full of vinegar like Tabasco sauces are.
5;Great Fruit Snack But small pouches;I love the product, but the pouches need to be bigger.  There's at least 7 pieces of fruit chews in each pouch, and like the previous reviewer pointed out, the are addicting!!  Save your money and buy it from your local supermarket store b/c Amazon is expensive.
5;Hemp Protein is the best Protein;Hemp protein is wonderful regardless the brand..
5;love these cookies;My son has a gf diet and these cookies are one of his favorites. They are great for school lunches or snacks.
5;flax is great;Milled flax seed is a great way to eat healthier, and add fiber and Omega 3 fatty acids to your diet. We put a tablespoon or so on our cereal in the morning and we honestly believe it contributes to our overall health.
5;No other granola will do;This is the best granola my family has ever had.  We cannot imagine eating another brand.
3;not what I ordered!!!!!;"I am sorry to say the two orders of Jolly Time (weight watchers point plus 1) was received as Jolly Time (weight watchers point plus 3).  Did not order the ""Point Plus 3""."
4;Too much can make your teeth rotten;i bought this for the kids on halloween because it was a major brand-nestle and it was cheap for allot of pieces of candy.When it was being shipped to my huse, it came at aorund 8/30 which was the day before halloween but unfortunately I wasnt there to sign for the UPS man and he couldnt deliever it to me until monday, which was when halloween was ended.
3;Doesn't taste so great;It's awesome that I can get all these nuts in one, but it's much tastier to eat the individual nut butters or nuts. This stuff isn't anywhere near as tasty as peanut butter.
4;Smooth and fragrant;I guess the tin isn't totally airtight, since I could smell the tea and bergamot that adds up to Earl Grey. The cup of tea was even more fragrant, smooth and not bitter.
1;Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!;We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves.
5;Wine Saver;We ordered this to replace the same wine saver we received as a gift.  It works very well, preserving the wine's flavor and extending its shelf life.
3;Less than advertised;These sardines are fair to good.  A little mushy for my taste, but nice flavor.
1;No redeeming qualities at all;I just don't understand the love for this tea.  I love almost all of Twinnings teas (except for Darjeeling, but that's a separate review).
5;BEWARE!!!;These chiles are hotter than hell!!!  There were a lot of peppers in the 4oz. bag, around 80-90 probably more, so I shared them with Chilehead friends.
5;If you like clam chowder, this will satisfy;It's not gourmet stuff, but this is good clam chowder.  A minute in the microwave, and out pops a good, quick meal.
5;Great Product;Great tasting bar.  I have one after lunch everyday.
5;My dogs enjoy these!;I give these to my dogs about twice a month. They really enjoy them and it entertains them for awhile.
5;great taste;"this mincemeat pie filling is Vegan and has great taste. Just put into prepared pie and bake, make a small 6"" pie, you need 2 jars for a large pie, Great fore the Holiday treats."
5;Great Product;I experienced a noticeable difference in endurance and recovery.  The taste is far better than I had anticipated.
3;Super disappointed with this version of this tea;I have been a long-time drinker of the Original Sweet and Spicey tea and was glad to find it in an organic version.  Since kicking the caffeine habit a few years ago, I have been drinking this tea every morning, and I really look forward to it.
5;Better than Snapple on the go;"I am a Snapple diet peach tea drinker and when I saw that they had come out with an instant ""on the go"" I was ecstatic. I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily."
5;Hard to find item;I find deep river snacks everywhere but hardly ever find the cracked pepper and sea salt.  Glad that Amazon carries it.
5;Geat product but OVER-PRICED;Great product!!!!! Some of the best cookies on the market.Shame local grocery stores do not carry these, at least not in NC.
5;Just what my dogs needed!;I was feeding both of my dogs 1st- Costco Brand food.  Next moved to IAMS.
5;Yummy but expensive;I buy these from time to time as a treat for myself or as a stocking stuffer.  I'd buy them more often if they were less expensive.
5;excellent tea excellent price good company to buy from;i love this tea. this is the best place to get it.
1;chocolate hazelnut Stash brand tea;Don't buy it.  I was so looking forward to this tea since the combination chocolate with hazelnut sounded so good.
3;Good product, but, . . .;"Old Mother Hubbard makes great snack for dogs, however, it seems that at least 25% of the busquits are broken & in ""tiny"" pieces.Guess next time I'll buy them locally, even tho they'll cost a bit more."
5;OM NOM NOM NOM!;These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across.
2;Skippy Natural with Honey is way too sweet!;My husband and I eat peanut butter by the spoonsful.  We had been buying Skippy Natural Creamy for several years and liked it very much.
5;Worth The Price;I had some of this tea a couple of years ago.  I started to try different types of green tea from a local health food store with a large selection of green teas.
5;I don't even like Indian food and I love this stuff!!!;I used to be able to find this in my local market and lately I can't seem to.  So I will be ordering it on the internet.
4;better than most;I like Nylabone products because most, if not all, are made in the USA.  After all the recent scares with dog products, I at least hope that the products made in the US are safe.
5;great treats;These are the best training treats you can buy.  My dog is more motivated in doggie class because of these treats than any other dog in class.
4;Savory, tasty;These sea salt and pepper cashews are addictive. The seasoning makes them even more addictive than if they were just plain.
5;Good Mushrooms;These are handy to have in the pantry for when I'm out of canned mushrooms.  They are much more expensive, but quite handy to have.
5;Delicious!;Be careful when opening the little packets because the powder is quite strong smelling.  I guess that comes with the powerful flavor this packs.
4;Good cereal;I thought this was a good-tasting, filling cereal.  I am not a fan of very sweet-tasting cereals, so I liked the fact that it was just a touch of cinnamon.
5;FOR THE MOM ON THE GO...;I absoutly love these things!! And so does my 13 month old..
5;Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash;After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.
5;Thai Garlic Basil Coconut Jasmine Rice;This rice is great, if you are tired of the same old plain with rice. I tried making it with coconut milk like the box suggested and it turned out pretty creamy.
5;Wellness for well fed doggies;I have two large dogs, one a yellow lab, and the other a lab/dalmation mix.  Both of these were on prescription foods(not the same, so quite costly), one had been treated for bladder stones, the other had pancreatitis.
4;Not like the regular Malted Milk;The formulation for the original version has no sugar, but sugar is the first ingredient in the chocolate version, making it more like Nestles Quick.  So I am using it in place of NQ.
5;great healthy cookies;These Newman graham cookies are wonderful.  I'm on my third case because they are so handy to take along for a snack.
5;Very few peanuts . . .;Few peanuts are bad peanuts, and very few peanuts are as good as these peanuts. There may be better peanuts, but how much better, really.
5;great coffe and good price;I have to admit, I bought the coffee when I was living in Alaska because of the name.  I keep buying it, because it is a very good cup of coffee.
1;These things are TINY;Seriously, don't buy this. These are so small (maybe the size of a normal thumb).
3;Not quite what I was hoping...;"After searching around for affordable imported amarena cherries, these Roland brand cherries came up at Amazon. Because of the great price and the fact that they seemed ""authentic"", i decided to purchase them -- all seven pounds of them."
2;Too much salt!;As with their others of their thin rice crackers, these contain so much salt they are not edible. BE CAREFUL before ordering these since there is NO RETURN and you might find yourself with landfill.
5;Nice small snack;Both of my dogs (chihuahua & corgi) love these snacks.  When they see me grab the bag, they start whining for one.
5;Chunked Sardines in Jelly - Natural Value Cat food;"Our 2 fussy cats seem to love this product. They actually on a raw diet, mostly ocean fish, and this one fits into a category ""Little Healthy Supper Snack"" pretty well! Even our 3rd cat who hates any fish and prefers ground beef only (highest grade possible) started to munch on it recently, we were pretty amazed."
5;Takes me back to my childhood years!;I am now 40 years young and I remember buying these cookies in junior high school from the school cafeteria..
5;Good snacks;Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.
5;Just a very good cookie.;"This is one of the few products I would buy even if I could have wheat products.  The cookie is not a ""soft"" type cookie."
5;Good product the second time around;I ordered regular Calm, and received Calm Plus Calcium.  These are different products.
5;Pigs Ears Ourchase;Great product at a super price.  The pigs ears are better than some of the other shippers of bulk pigs ears.
4;Pretty good, but could be improved...;The salmon was a little spicy, which was okay. It tasted pretty good.
5;World's best sweet & sour mix hands down;This puts other sweet & sour mixes to shame.  It's not sickeningly sweet and blends beautifully - great for everything from margaritas to daiquiris and Rose's quality too.
5;Best Gen Mai Tea Bags;I have tried all the brands of Tea Bagged Gen Mai Cha I can find on the market and the Numi is by far the best.  It is as close to fine loose leaf Gan Mai (Green Tea with Toasted Rice) tea as I have ever found.
5;Best Tasting and Healthiest Ready to Drink Meal Replacement Shake;I've been searching since the days that Kashi stopped producing their meal replacement shake mix for something that tastes just as good and is just as good for you.  I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.
5;my dog rated this one;This sauce will make your dog dance with glee.  It's also a lot less expensive than buying wet dog food or individual packets of sauce.
5;Grilling with Hickory Smoked Salt;This is a wonderful spice to add to any meat that you are grilling and it gives such a wonderful flavor.  I also use in when I marinate a whole filet in soy sauce and the hickory smoked salt.
2;2 stars for the acting, Movie was DUMB;the acting was not bad, the very very end was pretty good , but, the rest of the movie sucked and was pretty boring. How these people rated it 4/5 stars i wont ever understand.
3;Good chocolate, horrible shipping prices!;Bought these for my wife. She absolutely loved the See's chocolate mix, which was great.
4;Was wondering if okay;"I was so excited to receive the Ceylon cinnamon sticks -- as others state, it arrives very quickly, (actually I received it prior to the Amazon shipping notification) -- I had read about the differences in cinnamon, but when mine arrived the cinnamon stick was curled in on itself from both sides and didn't seem to be as ""papery"" on the inside.."
5;Good flavor;If you don't like cinnamon and orange and spice flavor in a tea, this tea is not for you. It was weard at the first time but now I love it.
5;Very Best Tea EVER I am forever HOOKED !;After the first glass of this wonderful tea I was hooked, it is mild, with just the right amount of fruit taste that does not overwhelm the tea taste, it is good unsweet or lightly sweetened.  I am normally not one to mess with my ice tea being from the south, I love it just like it is but this is a wonderful and very refreshing change.
2;Cats stopped eating it;I switched to this food in an effort to stop the daily vomiting with my six cats. They ate it for about a year with no problem.
3;"Should be called ""Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts""";"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list."
5;Great;These cookies are really good. My husband and grandkids who do not have to be gluten free love them.
5;Delicious!;Just started gluten-free diet and was mourning sliced bread and desserts. Bought 2 loaves from New Grains.
1;not lemon balm?;Ordered this stuff because of the wonderful antiox etc you retrieve from lemon balm, kind of stunk you could only purchase 3 at a time instead of one.<br />But I grow lemon balm in my own garden and dry it for teas etc, and with this I thought YAY none i have to dry and wait for the tea myself.
1;Misleading packaging;I bought it thinking that it's some kind of Camarel Macciato mix. Now I'm stuck with 3 box of creamers and no coffee.
5;Cuppa Green;Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.
5;Great Flavor;Scottish Breakfast Tea is a very robust tea.  Although probably not a purist way to drink it, I like it with lemon and sugar which both enhance the slightly smokey flavor.
5;Very Good;my two Golden Retrievers loved these -- AND they kept them busy longer than other chews.  A bit expensive, so they will not get them often, but they WILL get them again.
5;Soooo much better!;I grew up drinking Lipton tea, and at work would drink whatever black tea they happened to have around. When I finally tried this one (it was on sale and had good reviews), I was amazed.
3;delite;the last package I got came with too much dirt making it impossible to eat.I had to get rid of 3 packages.
5;Sweet vanilla goodness...;I love Kashi products.  Have yet to meet one I have really hated.
5;Our Family's Favorite Salt;Do a taste test. Wet your finger and dip it in some standard table salt.
5;A new favorite;I have enjoyed Twinings teas for, oh, more than 20 years now. I was immediately suspicious of this new blend, if only because Twinings seemed to be attempting to capitalize on people's renewed appreciation for the tradition of afternoon tea.
5;I was really impressed!;I participated in a fundraising walk for children with food allergies today and WowButter was one of the samples that was available to try. I tried it when I got home and I really liked it! I thought it was just slightly less sweet than PB, and my boyfriend couldn't tell the difference when he tried it straight up.
4;Swiss Colony 27 favorites;My Swiss Colony 27 favorites was received in the time advertised and in the best of shape. My family and friends dove right in on the day received and we found the product fresh and Delicious as well as plentiful.
5;Works like a charm even for smart and/or finicky dogs;First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works..
5;Great everyday tea;I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea.  This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors.
5;Sweet strawberry flavor, very refreshing;I was surprised by how much I like this tea. First, the taste is great.
4;WARNING--NOT GLUTEN FREE;While I find this dish to be quite tasty, those with Celiac disease should be aware that Tasty Bite dishes are not gluten free.  There is a warning on the label that the product is manufactured in a place where wheat is also manufactured, and there is no sign of an official GF label.
5;Delicious Duplex Cookies!;These organic cookies are absolutely delicious! The chocolate tastes rich and not overly sweet, and this is balanced nicely by the vanilla half. The nutrition facts and ingredient list are the icing on the cake - so much better for you than Oreos and just as good (if not better) tasting.
5;Tastes great, only 2 ingredients & the oil doesn't separate out;I keep this in my fridge.  When I first tried almond butter I purchased another brand and can't remember the name.
4;great product all around for anyone who drinks coffee;Coffeemate Coffee Creamer- Product Review<br /> For as long as I can remember I have been an avid coffee drinker, picking up coffee at a gas station or Starbucks to start out most of my days. Growing up my mom always drank her coffee black so I never had much experience with creamers.
5;Mmmm. These are SO good!;"What attracted me was the Newtons name on the package and I wondered how can they have a ""new"" Newtons as good as Fig Newtons? Tempting too was the introductory pricing at the supermarket. So far I have tried the chocolate-raspberry, cranberry-citris, and blueberry-brown sugar."
3;Prefer the original flavor because the Mango tastes fake;I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other.
5;yummy;These are really delicious cookies and they are far healthier than most of the junk in the stores.  They are full of all natural ingredients, no high fructose or additives here.
1;Big Train chocolate Chai;I was truly disappointed.  If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this.
1;Ground up;I love these big cheez-its, but, the boxes I received were all ground up.  At least 30% or more of the contents were ground into very small pieces, and the rest was broken up into larger pieces.
4;Jasmine green tea;I personally prefer a heavier Jasmine flavor to my green tea.<br />However, this is an excellent tea and one that I would recommend.
4;Good;I feel like this K-cup variety has been unnecessarily & harshly criticized both on Amazon and the Keurig site. It's kind of like a sweetened caffeinated hot chocolate.
5;So yummy!;This pizza crust was great!! My 2.5 year old son has had severe food allergies (to milk, eggs, wheat, and all mammal meats) his whole life, so he has never had pizza before.
2;Chocolate;"I was very excited that I was able to find this candy on-line, especially at amazon as it is my girlfriends favorite and she thought she could only get it in PR.  Unfortunately the candy must have been on the shelf for a long time and seemed to be ""stale."
5;Nice;These work. And my little buddies really like these.
5;Great for early mornings;These are great for a quick & filling breakfast. The cinnamon flavor adds a nice twist to the original.
4;Makes pork chops moist and savory;I hadn't had Shake n Bake since I was a kid, and I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe, but the flavor seems much more savory than I remember.  It added a nice coating to the pork chops and they came out moist and very flavorful.
5;Sheldon's favorite!;We were having a terrible time finding a food that our little shihtzu, Sheldon liked and liked him back.  I tried a few of the Castor & Pollux foods and he loved them all!  Plus, there wasn't any adjustment time with his system.
3;Great cereal but not a great deal;This cereal is great with or without milk and it is easy to finish a box quickly. Amazon ships the cereal quickly and the cereal is always fresh and months away from the expiration date.
5;My cats love this food;One of my cats has a sensative stomach, I bought this cat food and all three of my cats love it. It has stopped my cat from throwing up the cat food with food coloring in store bought cat food.
5;AWESOME!;I bought the 5lb variety pack of lollipops during my last order..
5;Dark Chocolate Tea - I Love This Stuff;"I couldn't believe it when I saw the poor reviews for this product.  I guess it proves that old adage, ""One person's trash is another's treasure."
4;Salmon anyone?;This California style salmon jerky tastes great, but a little overly dry and hard to chew, in my opinion. Still it is nice to have, and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon, somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere.
5;Great Snack;I first purchased this item in an airport when I was out West.  Loved it but couldn't find it anywhere on the East coast.
4;Great Delivery Service;My son is allergic to regular milk and is on a Gluten Free diet, but still needs to get protein & calcium in his diet.  He loves taking the Pacific Natural Foods Almond Milk cartons to school in his lunch box, and you can't imagine how disappointed I was when the only store near us that carried it stopped.
5;this coffee is great..;Found it much cheaper other place though. It works for what need .
2;Bugs?;Please correct me if I am wrong, but ours was infested with bugs! I ordered the subscribe and save a few months ago and as the bag instructed, I refrigerated the contents of the bag that I opened. I left the other two bags unopened in my cupboard.
5;Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor;"I started buying these as a ""to go"" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor."
5;Wow;The smell in the single serve package is a little off putting, but I suspect that that's because it is actually the smell of good, organic coffee. Even brewing, the smell is a bit sharp, but that first cup is.
5;Great taste;I love these K cups they have a nice tea taste. They are cheaper than other places.
5;Least expensive per unit;Of all the Keurig coffees I have tried thus far, this one is my favorite.<br /><br />It doesn't make sense, but this 18 pack is also the least expensive per unit of all the various sizes I could find on Amazon.
5;Delicious beef;It was delicious. I ate the whole thing in 2 days.
5;Delicious and healthy;I keep a box of these on my desk at work to chew after meals. Very tasty, well packaged, and great for your teeth.
5;What a great snack;These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go.
5;Yum! Yum! Yum!;We first tried Lundberg rice about 6 months ago. We have tried almost all of the varieties, and we haven't ever been disappointed.
1;"Bland, overpriced ""ramen""";This has no flavor. The noodles are disgusting.
5;Excellent Product!;Would buy again. This is a fantastic all natural sunflower seeds bread made in Poland.
5;natures path review;I like that this product uses organic and natural ingredients. I like the taste of these a lot too and they don't seem overly sweet.
5;Great hydration drink;I love being able to buy this really good exercise hydration drink at the great Amazon price.  Truly a value.
1;You will smell awful and can make you and/or baby gassy;I tried taking for a few weeks, 3 caps 3 x's per day as recommended to aide in nursing. I saw absolutely no difference in the amount of milk i was pumping or producing.
5;wow  really;So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away..
5;Wonderful sassy flavor;If you like tea AND rootbeer this is the product for you.  Quite refreshing and easy to mix.
4;Nice and Easy to Make;I keep and make Crystal Light products all the time so when Moctails Mojito came out I wanted to give it a try.  Like all Crystal Light products it is easy to make.
5;A gift that went over very well;I purchased these for a friend who loves shortbread and has highly discerning tastes.  I think he inhaled them, so apparently they're excellent.
5;Collie Yum;The Collies in rescue can't wait until the morning when they have their Innova Treats..
1;Never got them;A little disappointed with Amazon here because although they advertise them, never got them and have received messages about delays three times so cancelled the order.  I would have liked to try them.
5;Great flavored coffee;Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
5;This was a gift I gave!!;I bought this for a Christmas gift and actually rec'd a call within an hour of their receiving it. They raved about the rich chocolate flavors of Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mixes.
5;Easy and delicious;I have bought these bars for years, but when I was no longer able to find them locally - I tried on Amazon!  Of course, ANYTHING you are looking for, you can find on Amazon!  I eat one of these bars with a cup of coffee in the morning as I like something to eat when I first get up.  Also great to have before going to workout.
5;Saved Me!;I realize that people may think it's kind of expensive for coconut water, but it's at least twice the price where I live! If I had a coconut tree in my building than I wouldn't bother, but I don't! It is the best thing after a long workout or if you have forgotten to drink enough water during the day. It really saved me when I got really dehydrated.
4;Yummy cookies;I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted.
5;XANGO is really helping us;This juice is a miracle in and of itself.  It is not a cure all.
5;Lots of perfectly acceptable Matcha for absolutely dirt cheap.;I go through a lot of matcha, and I've tried a lot of different kinds. No, this is not tea ceremony quality tea powder, but it is bright green and tastes great.
4;great grilling sauce;My daughter bought this for me and I was afraid to use it because of the ginger in the title. It has become a favorite with chicken on the grill.
5;My cat's favorite treat;I have three rescued cats and feed them regular food of course but when they want a treat they will only eat the Whiskas Savory Salmon. I have tried more expensive treats and pretty near every type and brand.
5;Love Love Love This Coffee!!!;I want to try other types of coffee but I am so stuck on this one that it's hard to try anything else!  This is a mild roast.  Medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days.
5;Yum! Yum!;These cherries are great mixed with dried blueberries, almonds, and walnuts and kept in the refrigerator for a quick snack.  Be aware however, the sugar content is quite high.
2;Cats are obligate carnivores;Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal.
5;3 LARGE Bags;I love these large bags! I use these onion rings for coating baked chicken and pork chops and the large size is very convenient and a much better value than the smaller sizes found in the grocery stores. I am able to find this large size at Sam's, but only around the Thanksgiving season.
5;Way better then Jax;I brought these a few times honestly and I even saw the Jax  on sale cheaper. Yes Jaxs are bigger and look tempting but thats all they are.
5;Brings me back to New Orleans....;I absolutely love this coffee.  It's like nothing I have ever tasted.
5;the best Hot sauce;this is one of the hottest hot sauces around and has great flavor..
5;Raw Extra Virgin Coconut Oil;I purchased this product at a health food store about 2 years ago and I've been buying it ever since. I've recently moved and the health food store is too far away so I decided to buy it off the internet.
4;good soup;This is the first time ive ever had miso soup and this was pretty good needed something to eat when i got home and did not want to eat anything too heavy and this filled me up..
5;Good for dogs' coat;Not just food, but creates soft, healthy coat on dogs.  Just rub in while petting.
5;Best coconut milk;There is no other brand of coconut milk as good as this one. It is thick, not watery, and wonderful.
4;Dependable Candy;"This is indeed ""dark"" chocolate and not ""bittersweet"" as the label on the Toblerone package indicates"
5;Great crackers;I've ordered these crackers numerous times.  They are really fresh each time they arrive.
5;Excellent price--huge jars!;I bought this as a flour substitute for some gluten-free recipes.  I'm glad it's in two large containers instead of one GIGANTIC container.
2;you have to use double the dose of this..;i don't like to knock a product..
5;excellent breakfast for little ones;this is the only cereal both my 4 year old used to have and my 2 year old has in the morning. with milk it is a nutritious beginning to their day.
5;My Wife Likes Them, I'm Okay With It;Pirate's Booty, at least from what I remembered, was pretty tasty. Strong, bold taste.
5;Most Excellent organic real fruit snack for all ages. My 9 yr old calls this his banana sauce. Also makes great baby food.;This is a cool organic fruit snack great for all ages not just kids.  I was looking for an organic fruit snack for my sons lunch box and this  is prefect.
5;Great taste and good for you!;I purchased this item for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veg servings a day.
2;Mediocre;This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date.
5;Great product, not so great shipping price;This product is really good and doesn't raise my blood sugar.  I did give it a 5 star, because the cereal itself is good.
5;Great for stubborn, pill needing dogs!;I have always loved these for giving pills to my dogs.  My Border Collie mix takes 4 pills a day, and this has been the only thing he will swallow with pills in it.
5;vegemite;I LOVE my vegemite, but then I am a kiwi and grew up as a vegemite kid. I eat it on toast, crackers, use it in Gravy as a flavour boost, I put it in stews, for the same reason.
1;amish popcorn;worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.
4;Not bad.;These are small and very salty. The taste is good, but very strong, so it's a good thing the package contains a small amount.
5;Goodish;Before buying this, I was unsure of what it would be. When I tasted it it was very sweet a little too much for my liking.
3;Not worth the money;I have yet to find that dog toy that keeps my busy dog busy as it says..
5;Coconutty!!!!;These are a great gluten free snack!  I eat them alone or add them as a topping on yogurt.  They are crunchy, slightly salty/sweet, not greasy and travel well in a hot car.
3;DOG SAYS: DELICIOUS -- MOM SAYS: MADE IN CHINA!;Like a previous reviewer, I, too, am concerned over the product being made in China. It looks like a very healthy product and my dog loves it but I only care to feed my dog US-based products so that I can ensure the high quality that he deserves.
2;Not strong enough;Smells nice but the flavor is weak.  I don't think the Keurig brewers really work for tea.
4;I'm hooked;It pains me to shell out almost $8 for six packets of instant iced coffee, but then I compare it to what I'd pay at a coffee kiosk.  It makes a potent 16 oz.
5;Best price you'll find;This is one of my favorite teas.  Stash's mix of green tea and chai spice is the best I have found.
4;Frequent use has made me a believer.;When I plucked a bottle of the new Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo off the Amazon Vine recently I must admit that I was extremely skeptical and harbored rather low expectations. For the better part of my adult life I had not been very particular about the brand of shampoo I used.
5;LOVE THESE! Very crunchy and tasty. Great for toddlers.;"We just ordered the ""Very Berry"" and the ""Tropical Fruit"" arrived in the same box.<br /><br />Berry - Not crunchy at all."
5;Best Baby Food EVER!;Sprout foods are amazing! From the moment you open the package you know this is not your ordinary baby food.  You can smell all the natural ingredients.
5;Very satisfied;Ordered this item as I am trying to eat more healthy. Was very skeptical at first coz of all  the reviews on the taste but I thought that I would give it a shot.
3;My dog is a genius!!;"No seriously, she is.  My dog's ""grandfather"" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift."
2;Making my cats sick;I switched exclusively to this Purina brand alternating between the flavors of salmon and chicken.<br />Its been 9 mos now, and I have today stopped the Subscribe and Save shipments as I am convinced its making my cats all three of them, sick.
3;tough, not indestructible;I have bought many Nylabones for my 1 year old english bulldog and the souper galileo is tougher than the others that I purchased, but I expected it to last a really really long time, and it was only a few months before he chewed away the end of it. I don't feel it is worth the money, but it does outlast the other nylabones.
5;Healthy and delicious.;This item was both delicious and good for your health.  Easy to prepare and serve at a moments notice.
5;Excellent Thai-flavored chip;I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.
5;Delicious but quite spicy!;I was very excited to get this product, as I like a lot of other Kitchens of India products.  I must say that this is VERY spicy.
5;Soo yummy;Taste exactly like a Caramel Apple. I love after my day sitting & relaxing & enjoying a cup of this amazing hot drink.
1;Clay infused with truffle oil?;When first purchased you could smell the truffle through the container, very strong. Stored it in the jar in a ziplock bag.
4;Good if you like Coffee;"This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is ""coffee flavored coffee"", in other words, no fancy flavoring."
4;"A solid ""basic cup""";"This is pretty good ""basic"" coffee.  It has a decent flavor, and isn't overly strong, and has a pleasant scent."
5;the pure pantry;"My friend sent this to me and now I use it for everything! It has the texture of real cake!!!!!!!! No longer feeling deprived.<a href=""http://www."
5;I love it...;This, to me, is the best tarter sauce I have ever bought.  I was a bit skeptical ordering 6 containers of it.
4;Cleans nicely, not strongly scented, pleasant to use;"The ""Dove for Men"" body wash has a nice feel - it lathers lightly, has ""microbeads"" that help clean the skin, and I did not find it to have a heavy fragrance.  The smell was somewhat reminiscent of a man's cologne, but light."
5;Cats Like it;I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier.
5;Nice and Hot - with great flavor and not just heat.;A very good and very hot sauce..
1;tastes nothing like pomegranate. save your money;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Cat Cookies, But Healthy;I was shocked when I opened the bag and found, instead of the little pellet thingies that comprise most cat treats, Big Cookies! Well, they are not exactly like cookies, but they are disks about two inches across.  I thought my finicky, ancient cat might sneer at these.
5;Simply the best;"It's one of the best Croatian products, which changed cooking all over the middle European countries.<br />You can use it in all ""salty"" recipes and you won't regret."
5;Energizing;The combination of ginger, pepper and sarsaparilla is delicious and distinctive. This tea gives me energy without the negative side effects of caffeine.
5;Ronzoni Ziti Rigati Pasta;My order arrived quickly in great shape. Product was as advertised.
4;I agree;I agree with San Diego.  I return to Newman's Own time after time after trying several others (and there are some other good ones out there, Deidrich's being one).
5;I smell like a girlscout cookie!;I bought this product to use an as alternative to lotions (I have pretty bad eczema) So far it's working well, and it smells like Samoa girl scout cookies (It smells MUCH better on your skin than it does straight out of the jar, so don't get turned off by the smell until it's on you).<br /><br />It hardens at room temperature, so be prepared to soak the bottle in hot water for a few minutes to get it out.
5;Amazon makes it easy.;This has been our basic favourite tea for years, but it was always a challenge to find it in this country.  Thanks to Amazon, we can order a good quantity for a reasonable price and just enjoy it.
5;Good tea;pretty good tea. I recommend steaming it longer than what it says on the box.
5;Makes me drool just thinking of them;The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions.
4;Canidae Dog Food;This is one of the best dog foods on the market.  It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally.
1;White mold visible on one closed jerky package;One of the 6 packages of jerky had white mold visible through the clear plastic.  Don't understand how that gets through quality control and sent to the customer.
1;Disappointed;The seeds came with a lot of little black seeds mixed in with the alfalfa seeds.  We have no idea what the little black seeds are, and they don't germinate when we sprout the alfalfa seeds.
1;They break easily;My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate.
5;Great taste!;Never thought that kiwi and banana would work but it does! I love this product, it's convenient and I like the fact that it's organic. I feel good about giving my babies something like this.
5;These things freaking ROCK!;Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.
5;Yummy snack;Popchip 100 calorie bags are a great snack that help me to control my portions.  I don't trust myself with the full sized bag!  These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags- there enough to satisfy me.
5;Great cat food;After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew.
5;Asume wrap and healthy!;Love this wrap.  Better than most for can fit a lot of veggies on it and it's only 100 calories for a full sheet.
1;Waste of money;I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL.
5;Great sugar substitute!;This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar.
5;A shout-out to those of us who want to maintain a healthy weight!;Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there.  But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite.
1;Artificial flavors tested on lab rats;"Nice how they leave out telling you this product has artificial flavor. Artificial flavor is lab created ""flavor"" tested on lab rats to ensure they get addicted and keep eating."
5;Save money on K cups, use these bags instead;I use these when I just want a cup of coffee. I make tea the same way.
4;Bacon is Good;Very good selection and a good quality product. Only draw back is it is not a premium bacaon but it has a premium price $8.
1;25% chance of rancid chips - No Thanks;I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.
5;Good Product;The coconut oil is great.  however when i received them one bottle was broken.
5;Delicious;The K-cups are great. This blend was just right.
4;Pretty good;So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.
5;Really Spicy!;I love spicy food and this product is really spicy and has good flavor at the same time. For some may even be too spicy to eat.
4;Beats Cinnamon Toast Crunch;Looking for a change, I decided to pick up a box of these. The taste is quite different from what I am used to.
5;What can you say about M&M's?;Obviously if you're reading this you've probably already had M&M's - so don't let that stop you from buying this package!  I love the size of this bag because it fills a candy dish that I have out completely with a few left over for me to eat up right away.  They last for a while - though not as long as they should - in my house, but I'll keep ordering them as they are a delicious treat.
5;Spicy World Cinnamon Sticks;After paying eight dollars for one small container of cinnamon sticks, I decided to try this item. It is an amazing value for a very low price.
5;awesome;This is one of the best tasting flavored coffees I have every purchased. I am very satisifed and will order again.
5;Excellent Coffee!;I like this particular Kona a lot. Very full bodied flavor.
5;works...;if it says clinically not proven I would not buy it. But a friend recommended this for breast feeding.
5;Yum yum;Absolutely very tasty chips. The best I have ever had.
5;Soft Gooey Decadence...;I have always been partial to soft chocolate cookies.  They're not only delicious, but we also get to be lazy while eating them for they just melt in your mouth.
4;Good Taste;This product is easy to make and has a great taste.  I just wish it was gluten free.
5;"Just what ""The Cat"" ordered.";"""The Cat"" will not eat anything else although he's been offered a varied menu.  It is all about him, I'm told."
5;Good for moka pot;I've been using this in my moka pot for several months. I also make an occasional pour-over with this coffee.
5;world King candy cigarettes;I bought the world king candy cigarettes from Amazon.com  I didn't know they made these anymore.
4;My Cats Love It;"I alternate between buying this and Newman's Own brand cat food.  I appreciate that the primary ingredients in Wellness are actually meat rather than filler like ""Chicken Meal"" or other ingredients that are not as good for cats."
5;My Dogs Love These!;"Ok, let's be honest. ""Dogs will be dogs"" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps."
1;Awful;No pumpkin or spice flavor at all. Worst Pumpkin Spice coffee EVER.
4;Good Product but OVERLY SALTY;I like this product but don't LOVE it..
5;Great Coffee;Love this coffee, it's just the right blend.  Not to strong, not to weak, this brew is just right.
5;Excellent;"Best popcorn oil I've used.  Pop your corn in this, add Flavacol brand salt afterwards (it can be found from other sellers on Amazon or directly from Wabash Valley Farms' website), then add a bit of the ""Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping"" which WBF also sells here, and your popcorn will be basically identical to what you get at a movie theater."
5;Great Gluten Free Snack!;The BHUJA dried peas make an awesome spicy/salty snack, and is GLUTEN FREE too.  I use them in place of croutons in a salad, and they are great to snack on alone instead of chips.
3;Nothing special;This is no more than a finely ground garlic powder.  Good, but able to buy in a store.
5;Mmmmmmm....chocolate!;I guess these are the expensive way to make hot cocoa, but we think that the taste is far better than any other instant hot cocoa product, and it's hard to beat the convenience. Have some on hand for when company drops by.
5;Delicious !;If you love chocolate truffles and raspberries, you will love this coffee.  Flavors are not overbearing -- just enough to enhance the coffee.
3;Disposible K cups via Amazon;The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard.
5;Even this non-tea drinker loves it!;I wouldn't consider myself a tea drinker, really
5;Great lean snack - ostrich!;These meat snacks are fabulous and incredibly healthy.  I first discovered them at my health club in New Hampshire, where they charge $2.
5;LOVE LOVE LOVE!;My son is now almost 3 years old and STILL loves these! I have been buying him the pouches for as long as he is been old enough and they are great! I only buy ones that have fruit AND vegetables in them. They are great for on the go, and also when he is sick and barley eating i give him one and know he is getting something healthy.
1;Very disappointed;"Description states: ""This is a variety of flavored coffee . ."
5;My cat loves these;My cat absolutely loves these things. The only downside to them is that they will dry out after a while.
2;NOT like starbucks green tea latte;i was looking for the type of powder starbucks uses in their green tea latte, and this was not it!<br />If you want something creamier and thicker than starbucks, and very sweetened, purchase this! It's not a bad taste, I think it's actually probably better if you want to make a milkshake type of drink, but adding even non fat milk, it's still very creamy, thick, and too sweet for my taste, its almost like ice cream..
5;They're Good Seeds.;These Flaxseeds are of good quality, I eat them daily.  Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own.
5;The only salt we use in our family plus health benefits;We've been using this salt in our home for about 3 months now. Let me just say I won't use any other salt ever again! I've never liked the taste of salt or used it much in cooking.
5;Awesome;If you like peanut butter are are trying to lose weight this is a great alternative. Great taste and low calories.
1;High levels of Arsenic;There are high levels of Arsenic in this formula from the organic brown rice they use. My pediatrician told me to stop using it because it has high levels of arsenic in it which is a poison! This happens because the organic brown rice used to make the formula soaks up the arsenic from the soil when it's growing and then when they use it, it contaminates the milk.
2;Cannot really taste the hazelnut flavor.;I am disappointed in that I cannot really taste the hazelnut flavor. The coffee is also light.
5;Great toy;I have an 11 month old great pyr. He eats everything.
5;Strong! Brew a 20 oz. Mug on 1 K-Cup!;If you love strong coffee with good rich, full flavor, then Jet Fuel is one you should try!  I have also found that I like it a little weaker sometimes.  I brew it on the large mug setting, lift & lower the lever, and brew another large mug.
1;this stuff is nasty!;someone gave me the jar of PB2.  I thought it was awful.
3;Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED;I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.
4;Worth a try!;From reading all the amazing reviews, I expected it to taste better than it did. I love regular peanut butter, so I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
5;Works for us!;I've been on the auto ship with this item for some time - I have a hard time finding it in our stores at times & when I do, it's always more expensive. I love the fact that this has natural ingredients made in the USA - My dogs are older - they need a simple diet & this fulfills all of our needs & it always shows up at the door when I need it.
3;My cat wouldn't eat the beef;This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.
5;wonderful product;These are softer and seem easier to digest than the Greenies brand.  I really like the Greenies, but my dogs were unable to completely chew them as well as the Nylabones.
5;excellnt;My hound is surprisingly picky about treats.  But these are his all time favorites.
1;Yikes! Gross;Yikes, this flavor is gross.  It smells/tastes like a musty old basement.
5;We LOVE this mix!!!;This is the BEST gluten-free pancake mix we have ever had!  In addition to great pancakes, you can make delicious biscuits, cookies, breads, and more.  (The back of the bag includes a number of recipes and the Pamela's website has even more.
5;very good;cats love it which is all that matters. so glad I got it for them.
5;Great tasting & versatile;Spelt has quickly become a favorite staple for me. These berries are great tasting and easy to work with- not to mention their nutritional value.
4;COOKIES!!!!!!!!!;My hubby and daughter LOVE these cookies. They are kinda spendy though.
1;chinese junk steel - breaks easily;Purchased 6 units as a test.  2 have broken in 2 weeks with moderate use.
5;try to eat only one;i have been looking for these cookies since i ate them in France  40 years ago.  found them at Fairway in NY and brought a box  back to Hawaii where i live.
5;thrilled by the mistake;What happened was I ordered Coconut butter..
5;Can't live without this!;Crazy hot and a powder..
1;Nostalgic Penny Candy;The majority of this candy was penny type candy.  Very disappointed in the value.
4;Good sample;Although it was a nice sample, there were too many of certain flavors.<br />(Should be 2 or 3 of one flavor - not 6)<br />Would have liked a little more variety.
5;Greatest invention since sliced bread!!;I discovered Popchips when I was on a trip to Vegas.  I doubted I could find them when I got home and I was almost right.
3;Hit or miss;My girls love raisins as a snack, so we have these on subscribe and save.  Our first batch was perfect- juicy, soft, and sweet raisins.
4;Bold, but Not Teeth Jarring Bold. Nice Flavor and a Nice Cup of Coffee.;"Wolfgang Puck French Roast is a nice, bold (not too bold), flavorful cup of coffee.  If you like <a href=""http://www."
5;Favorite BBQ sauce;I do not like the sweet, thick, dark 'Kansas City' style of BBQ sauce..
1;Pods are torn and coffee weak;I fell for the 30% off and tried these pods for my Senseo.  There is less coffee per pod than the Timothy's or Fratello's.
4;Nice color!;I bought this to use in my candy melts. I love the color and it barely alters the flavor.
5;Organic and Yummy too;Imagine a yummy treat to hand out to all your friends, BUT its organic and healthy. Well they've invented these lollipops that are allergen free, gluten free, egg free, soy free and dairy free.
5;A FAVORITE;I have been drinking Emeril's for almost 2 yrs. and have been constantly looking for another favorite.
3;Disapointed;I'm disapointed because it didn't work on the under eye puffiness. But that could be because of an illness I have.
5;The motivation you need;This product works great to give you that initial push you sometimes need to get moving without any jittery feelings or crash later.  I only use 1/2 of the bottle at a time and the no refrideration needed makes it handy to keep in the car and drink on the way home from work when you have a lot you need to accomplish at home.
5;FAMILY LOVES IT!;Got this stuff and it looked like they just swept it off the beach . I think its still wet actually.
5;No. 1 Green Mountain;I love the green mountain brand.  I have less weak coffee results with them too.
1;They changed the Chips now they taste horrible;I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.
5;Zeus LOVES these !!!;"Our 150 lb, 8 year old bullmastiff absolutely loves these.  When he hears us say ""happy hips"" his ears perk up and he follows us everywhere."
5;My new favorite chocolate;I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Lindt Chocolate, especially their Dark varieties. 85% has been my primary indulgence for awhile, with some 99% on occasion.
4;Good product for the price;This product can be purchased anywhere and in a pinch whereas products like Gu have to be purchased at specialty stores. The other product works a bit better for me at keeping my energy level where it needs to be.
5;Emerald Forest Xylitol--Great Product!;I have been ordering this product for quite a while and have never had any problem with it.  No odor, it tastes like sugar and I use it in cooking all the time.
5;Very pleased;The whole process was very smooth. We received the dog food in good condition and it arrived fasted than I would of thought.
2;Not Good;This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.
5;Some of the BEST coffee with a KICK!;Green Mountain puts out some really good coffees, and the K-cup is no exception.  Double Black Diamond is very strong and rich in flavor.
5;Review of Luzianne Coffee;Luzianne Coffee is the best Coffee I have ever tasted, and I am 84years old.<br />Tried to buy it for everal years at Publix, Winn-Dixie, and other stores here in Florida, but it was not available.
4;Decent product but not a good way to keep fresh;Bought this product however it doesnt seem like a great way to keep the coffee airtight. I tried the other K-cup similar cups and they seem to keep it fresher.
4;My Pup Loves it!!;My pup loves it!! The minute I open my amazon package he smelled the bones! He instantly sat and waited patiently for me to open the pack of Smartbones.<br /><br />I am so glad I finally found a better alternative to rawhide.
3;fairly goood ceral, somewhat high price compared to local stores;howdy y'all,<br /><br />the current price works out to $3.50 per box.
4;Light Coconut Flavored Coffee.;I am usually a non flavored coffee drinker, but I do like to mix things up every now and again. This is a lightly coconut flavored coffee.
1;Simply - It's terrible;If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee.
5;Fell in love with P-O-G juice in Hawaii. Glad it's on Amazon.;My wife and I absolutely love the passion-fruit/orange/guava juice when we went to hawaii. We tried othr places but couldn't find it, so very glad that its availale through Amazon.
5;Great Wine from South Africa;"I fell in love with ""Roodies"" when I first taste-tested it in Vancouver, BC about 12 years ago.  I'm not a fan of mixed varietal wines at all, but this one is always stocked in my home."
5;Fentiman's Shandy;Probably the best soda I've ever had. The beer and the lemonade go very well together.
4;I liked the design, but my pup's too smart for it;I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, thinking it would keep her busy and entertained. It took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side, and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically.
3;Pleasant but nothing to get excited about;I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website.
1;Why mess with a good thing?;What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.
5;Gotta love Gerber;I love buying with Amazon's subscribe and save.  I order enough baby food for a month and at great prices.
5;salad in a bowl;Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is better than a nice bowl of caesar salad with a hot plate of homemade spaghetti after a long day of not eating anything.  Maybe some Italian bread, too.
5;good potatoes;I buy organic whenever possible, both for the health of my family and for the benefit of farm workers and everyone else on the planet.  These potatoes are great way to make organic mashed potatoes when you are short on time.
2;can't judge book by cover;"Just because the list of ingredients seem natural  does not mean it is ""healthy"". If the fruits,nuts,seeds,syrups etc."
5;Another great deal and tastes very good;This is a great tea to have at 'tea time' or after work, whenever that is for you.  It tastes great at a great price.
5;Best Liked and Taste Friendly;Dear Friends:  I only recently came into contact with Trader Joe for natural Dog Treats. About Four months ago
1;The glass is half empty for you!;"Absolutely disgusting. Wasn't expecting a normal ""water"" taste, but I wasn't expecting to taste metal either."
3;Go for 3.5 lb bag for cheaper deal;I don't know why, but the 7 lb bag is 3 times as much cost for only 2 x the amount of food that the 3.5 lb bag has.
3;Doesn't really taste like a mojito;While the Moctails Mojito has a nice lime flavor, it still has the sweetener aftertaste.  I read one reviewer recommended that you use less water or more product but while the flavor is stronger, it does not disguise the artificial sweetener.
4;Not bad;Prior to trying out this product, I have only flavored my water with the powered products.  This product had a very nice Fruit Punch flavor, but an after taste that kicks in shortly after finishing the beverage (20 oz bottle in less than a couple of minutes).
5;Not Disappointed!;After reading the 'yuk' reviews, I was concerned it would not be palatable.  I made a shake with the same ingredients I use with vanilla flavored whey protein: start with 1/2 C unsweetened original Living Harvest Hempmilk, 4 TBS Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein, 1 C frozen strawberries (or more as they will thicken the shake), 1/4 small avacado (for healthy fat MUFAs!) It blended up thick and creamy just like the whey protein, and tasted absolutely delicious (a healthy taste, anyway).
4;Good in small doses, great for snacks;Even though I'm Mexican, I do like to go eat at taco bell once in a while (Chalupas mostly) anyway, when I saw this up for review I though it would be nice to have this around.<br /><br />The flavor was really good, my brother and I liked it so much at first that we even used this sauce with tortilla chips, doritos etc as snacks, we used it up in about 1 week, but oh man, this sauce caused us a bit of stomach sickness, not because of spice or anything, (its not spicy at all) but because it seems we abused of consuming this product.
5;Delightful find;We are so glad we can buy this item again.  This creamer makes the coffee a delight any time!!!<br /><br />Well, that comment was written before we received the box.
5;Delicious aroma, Very concentrated;I use this product in a commercial kitchen and bakery.  It has an incredibly fresh and clean orange scent, with no bitterness or alcohol scent.
5;Excellent quality and a great price to boot;I've tried a number of prepared versions of the Sole Almondine and find Omaha Steaks product to be the most succulent and delicious of them all.  The preparation is easy, straightforward, and always has excellent results.
1;Not that hot;The first ingredient in this sauce is vinegar. That's mostly all you can taste.
5;Great convenience;These pods fit perfectly in the Bunn single coffee maker.  They are hard to find in the store<br />for the Bunn,  so it is nice to have them delivered monthly to my home.
5;I like the product a lot but do not buy on Amazon.com;"Nothing at all against this, or any other seller selling this item. I very much enjoyed my DIY ""spiked"" drinks."
5;Tasty!;Tasty way to refuel after kicking a** at the gym. Most protein drinks have a chalky taste to them that I can't stand but not Muscle Milk.
5;Great chips for a pepper enthusiast;These chips are the hottest chips I have tried. Above being hot, they have a very good smokey taste.
3;Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour;I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.
1;Hated it;This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful.
1;Would not recommend;When a product has honey or vitamins in the title or description, people automatically think healthy.  These are not healthy at all and do not provide any extra energy.
5;LOVELY;It's the second time i bought this product(3 bags together)since i really love it.(possibly addicted to it)<br />As an Argentinian living abroad for so many years i was thrilled to find such a good deals in Amazon.
5;Recommended;My dog is not a picky eater but she loves this food. It's much more convenient than preparing real home made food, and cheaper (if you buy the meat in one of those big family packs) than buying premium canned dog food.
5;Smarter Tomato Paste;I saw on one of the cooking shows where they used Tomato Paste in a tube.  I liked the idea.
5;Great Taste . . .;and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.
5;Kiddo loves it!;We use jar baby food to supplement what we make homemade..
3;Interesting taste;I drank the water after working out and felt really good, very engergized.  The only issue I have is it doesn't taste like regular water, it has a different flavor.
2;Not What it Appears to Be, Full of HFCS!;The main ingredient is high fructose corn syrup not agave nectar. It's not pure and not good for diabetics.
5;Highly addictive! Great with beer;I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer.
5;Exactly what I was looking for!;I am so excited that I bought this dressing.  After trying SO HARD to find a recipe for a salad dressing that tastes like the one often served in Japanese restaurants, this one is PERFECT!  Not only is it delicious, but this one is the 'light' version and I don't feel guilty eating it.
2;Yeach;Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee.
2;No reaction....;I ordered both the beef and Turkey flavors. My dogs would not even take these in their mouths.
1;Strange Packaging;I ordered this product and what I received was not the item pictured. Instead I received the almonds in a ZIP LOC bag and is apparent that it is not professionally packaged.
5;My favorite green tea hands down;The Twinings green tea has what I call an American taste i.e.
5;Did you feel that coffee lover?  That was the freaking Quickening!;We're comfortable being honest are we not?  Cool, so I have a coffee problem, I'm OK admitting that to you.  And with that affliction comes the experience of having consumed a crap-load of coffee from all over, K-cups and otherwise.
4;Works great in morning smoothies!;I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems.
5;The real deal;Clearly the best of the best.  If your body is worth the best, then this is it for a USA brand.
5;Smoother than it sounds.;I purchased a variety of K-cups when I got my coffee maker. Jet Fuel not only has a cool name, but it's rich and smooth.
2;useless - I feel no effects whatsoever;I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.
3;Very minty;I love Larabars and I bought a box of these when they were on sale and I didn't like these as much.  They are a little too minty for me.
5;All i know..........;OK, let's get one thing straight. my girlfriend HATES Chocolate!!!!! i mean i can't even get here to eat one chocolate chip cookie!!!!! but for some reason she loves these little things, and to be frank so do I.
5;Best Wing Sauce;Syberg's in St. Louis has the most amazing wing sauce.
5;My Picky Cat LOVES this food!;I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it.
5;Nutiva Coconut Oil - YUMMY!;Very tasty, great flavor for just about anything, starting with my morning eggs, as a spread on a toasted bagel, anything.  I haven't found a single food where the subtle coconut aroma would clash with the flavor of the food I am cooking.
4;Good tasting bar;The taste is one of the better tasting Larabars I've had. It has a slight sour taste because of the dried fruit pieces, but it's less noticeable then some of the others.
5;Loved by all!;I bought these cookies for someone with Celiac Disease who needs to eat gluten free.  Not only did HE love the cookies, but so did everyone else that tried them.
1;The wrong Crackers;I have been unable to find the old recipe/box in stores so I was SO EXCITED when I saw these online so I ordered two of them..
4;We love this cereal for our baby;We love this cereal and the fact that it has probiotics.  I am not a big fan of the DHA from external sources such as algae, because it is not the same as the DHA found in breast milk.
5;Great high fiber snack.;These are a great high fiber snack for only 90 calories.  I usually have one mid-morning to make it through to lunch.
5;By the BEST Jelly Beans;My husband is a jelly bean fanatic (and not the gourmet kind).  We have had a hard time lately finding regular jelly beans just at the store it seems these gourmet are more popular.
1;Don't waste your money;I was looking forward to trying this soup based on the excellent reviews posted about this product. Imagine my surprise when I opened one and discovered that 80% of the bowl was chicken broth--and not a very tasty one at that.
4;Our dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie;"I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention ""Greenie""."
5;the only peanut is Mr. Peanut!;Great quality wholesome nuts, minus peanuts - which aren't really nuts, anyway. Not as many pecans or cashews as there are almonds.
5;Finally, satisfying sweet and crunch!;I tried these chips for the first time yesterday, and I loved them. I'm a hard-core Crunchoholic, and these have the best crunch with just the right amount of sweet and cinnamon.
1;Awful;Good price but the coffee is horrible.  It tastes both sour and bitter.
5;Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend;I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend.
5;Totally Yum!;I'm a college student and I found this product in the campus store. At first I wasn't sure about eating cheesy-ramen but decided to give it a try.
4;Celcius Energy Drink;I was pleased to find this product on Amazon.  It was sent to me with no shipping charges.
5;Fantastic chips but caused food alleregy issues;My son has Soy and Milk alleregy issues and had a minor reaction after eating a bag of these chips.  It happens every so often when he eats something marked with &#34
4;Wonderful Holiday Beverage (Especially for Pumpkin Fans);Okay, first off, full disclosure:  I am a pumpkin fanatic. I love the taste of pumpkin when the holidays roll around, from pumpkin cookies, to pumpkin pie, pumpkin soup, and (yes) even pumpkin ale.
5;Sweet!;I started using this product at the recommendation of the HCG Diet. The liquid form is better than the packets on the market because those use a chemical to freeze dry it to powder.
4;Great taste and full of vitamins;These pouches are small and convenient to carry around. Just pour the powder into the water and let it dissolve.
5;Best Graham Crackers ever!;I had been looking for graham crackers without hydrogenated oils and no high fructose corn syrup.  These are the best!  Great value buying them this way, it saves over $2 per carton from the local stores.
5;Chips 4 R Salsa Gift Baskets;We're a upcoming Authentic Mexican Style Salsa Company formerly from Tucson, Arizona, now located in Bend, Oregon. We wanted to make gift baskets for our customers and needed products to fill them.
5;Great chips;I know some have given these a bad review for their taste.  I really like the taste - and most would consider me a picky eater.
5;Yummy!;I'm not allergic to nuts but still think this is the BEST trail mix!  It's a nice combination of sweet & salty.  I could eat a bag in 1 sitting so I divide up the package into 6 portions.
4;Yummy;I bought these caramels because I needed a treat that is individually wrapped (they stand along side Jolly Ranchers and Starbursts!)  They taste great
5;Excellent scones;I love these scones.  They were very easy to make, and far above the rest on the shelf in terms of texture and flavor.
4;Very Tasty;I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box.
3;Misleading Title;This product is actually a MIX of the purple eco rice and white jasmine rice.  NOT AT ALL what it says in product description on Amazon.
1;TERRIBLE FOOD;I have a cocker with food intolerance and I needed something based on fish.<br />So in the shop they suggested me this.
5;nutrition bar;not dry, tasty, flavorful but not strong, not grainy, not sticky or tacky, no powdery dry tastless aftertaste as with some nutrition bars.  I found them enjoyable to eat and get nutrition too.
2;So-so reaction from a picky dog;These were on sale at Petco, so we gave them a try. They're too big to give for frequent clicker treats with my 35 lb dog.
4;Yummy and Fruity;Licorice is a weakness
2;Distinct beany flavor;Sorry to spoil the celebration, but for those not on a Gluten-free diet, this cake mix is sure to disappoint.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the batter is truely revolting, useful perhaps for a practical joke or poisoning the neighbors.
5;Best Tea I've Ever Had;Over the past year, I've tried over 12 types of loose leaf tea, looking for one that I would want to drink every day. Now, with this delicious tea, I've found it.
5;Tasty!;As another reviewer noted, if you eat spicy food a lot, this is NOT going to be spicy to you. Regardless, it has a very good flavor, and the extra spice just makes it taste better to me.
5;Great for dogs with sensitive stomachs;I must say these are the best puffed lamb ears we've tried and my dog who normally has a very sensitive stomach can eat as many as she wants and never gets ill from them. They are crunchy and fun and smell good too
4;Butter;Follow up Review<br /><br />The 6 bottles that I got were quite decent but did not have the exquisite buttery taste that the initial large bottle that I got has.  Not sure what the quality issue is here.
1;Diet lover's delite;I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks).
5;Nopalina Awesomeness!;Nopalina is a must have for anyone trying to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight. I think it is especially great for women.
3;Our Baby Won't Eat It;I love Earth's Best and our son eats almost everything by them. Not their fault that he doesn't seem to like green beans but the consistency is a bit runny for a stage 2 food in my opinion.
4;Evo dry food - Herring and Salmon formula;Both of my cats are doing very well now that we switched to this food.  Their coats are healthy and they have lots of energy.
2;Just know what you're getting;The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil.
1;Coconut?  No Way;I love coconut and didn't expect these M&M's to be the absolute best, but I didn't expect them to be the worst, either.  They are artificial tasting without a hint of real coconut.
5;Pico Pica Love;I grew up in California and have eaten Mexican food all my life.  Pico Pica is a hot sauce that has lived in every refrigerator!  You can't find a more flavorful mexican hot sauce!  I now live in Indiana, and unfortunately you can't go to the market and just buy some.
3;OK, but not up to normal Milano standards.;I guess I should've known: I checked out the prices for the various permutations of the Milano brand name and this was the cheapest.  The cookies arrived in fair condition, with some of them broken already.
5;Hard to get and find;I love the Chai Latte for an alternative to coffee. But this flavor is either in high demand or it's being discontinued? Hard to order (usually out-of-stock) or can't find at stores.
2;Didn't taste good and didn't provide energy;The first thing I noticed was the taste was overwhelming - but I figured that's fine - vitamins usually don't taste terrific.  But afterwards I didn't really have an increase in energy.
5;Answer to prayers;As a suffer of diverticulosis I cannot eat popcorn (the hulls are the problem). POPCORNERS came as if they were an answer to prayers.
5;Imported Grape Leaves (krinos) 1lb jar, DR.WT. 9oz;I was very happy with these grape leaves.  They were a nice size and firm .
5;My Dog Loves Zukes Cranberry Bones!;Full disclosure: I haven't chewed on these bones myself--this review is based on what I perceive is my dog's opinion.
5;Same excellent taste, new look!;Title says it all. I drank the Good Earth China Black with peach citrus accents for a very long time.
5;Convenient, fantastic buy;This is a great find for our family. First off, mixed vegetables is one of the best flavors of baby food.
5;Spicey Flavors!;A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself.
5;Great organic food.;I loved this food for my girls and they loved it too.  They didn't like the texture at first because they were not used to having chunks in their purees.
2;too weak;I bought this brand before and it was great in other flavors and I usually love Colombian coffee, but this time the coffee is too weak, has little flavor and it tastes stale. I have to actually two pods for one coffee cup which makes it expensive as well.
5;Not bad at all...Dog gives two paws up;when I first received these doggie treats I was a little concern since they appeared to be TOO hard. My pup is 16 years old and missing a couple of teeth.
5;Small Boxes;These are the small boxes of Juicy Juice. I love the small boxes.
2;Tastless crackers;"I love this line of crackers and all of the other flavors are really delicious and crunchy.  I expected more flavor from these ""salted date"" crackers but they really had very little flavor at all."
5;The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!;"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that ""crunch"" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start."
5;Great digestion support;Nothing fancy, just good stuff.  I drink Kombucha for digestion support and this really helps with that.
5;Great!;Lightly salted, fresh and infinitely better than most grocery kinds. I highly recommend these pistachios, as other brands are way too salty for me.
4;mixed thoughts;The last time I bought this product on Amazon I paid more than twice as much as I did this time.I would like to know why the large disparity in price.
5;GREAT;These are great treats. I love that they are not large treats.
5;Yummy;Yummy and a good exchange of nutrition for the calories. The bars are crunchy yet creamy because of the coating.
4;Needs more instruction but we figured it out;"Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the ""One Love"" variety is meant for two cups per ""single serve"" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to ""Stir It Up"" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song."
5;Prefer over regular Red Bull;I had not tried Red Bull Total Zero prior to purchasing the case on sale at Amazon.  I've had the regular and the sugar-free flavors and to me, I prefer the taste of Total Zero.
2;if you like the sound of wasps;The slow warm up time is acceptable enough, but I have them in a bathroom fixture over a vanity mirror, a situation that puts me about two feet from the bulbs when I'm shaving. I won't exaggerate--it isn't as noisy as an electric razor (which I don't use), but it does sound as if wasps have built a nest behind the medicine cabinet.
3;Contains sulfates;I find it odd that a color safe shampoo would contain sulfates. Beware if you are trying to avoid them, especially if you have any kind of keratin treatment.
1;Not even a hint of passionfruit;There is not even a hint of passion fruit nor mango in this tea. One can only taste an overpowering amount of rose hips and citrus peel.
5;I am not exaggerating...;Little Lulu, my six month old Miniature Scnauzer, developed foul breath. It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more.
5;LOVE THIS STUFF;I have yet to order it on amazon but I eat this stuff practically every night for dinner.  I work 10-14 hours a day so I'm usually on the go and don't get home until 7:30 or 8pm at night.
3;Shouldn't be called French Roast;The flavor of this coffee is okay, but I felt it shouldn't be labeled as French Roast as it just doesn't have that deep roasted flavor that I love so much in a French Roast.  It's a much more mild, bland roast.
5;Excellent product!;"I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from ""itchy butt"" which is common in pugs."
5;Great for my little doggie;So I switched to Organix after feeding my dog Wellness since she was a pup. Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm.
5;Yum. The best Gummis available in the US.;I'll admit, I am a gummi snob.  I've been devouring these little guys since the 1960's, when they were only available when my Oma sent a few packages from Europe.
5;Makes the best carrot cake!!! Better than homemade;This make the best carrot cake, super moist. I make it into cupcakes and keep them in the freezer until i want to eat them.
5;The Inner Child;It's wonderful to have a candy cane year round.  I don't care for that many sweets, so for me what could be better than an old fashion treat that is also low calorie.
5;Excellent for strong coffee lovers!;This is my absolute favorite for the past year or more.  Bold, strong flavor in every cup without the bitter or smokey taste or smell of other similar coffees.
5;Received 6 expired K-cups, BUT....;I really LOVE the idea of this decaf sampler.  I am a new Keurig owner and a relatively new coffee drinker so I haven't tried a lot of different brands/flavors yet, and was really excited to get this sampler.
1;Bad  Product;The door on the litter box gets stuck inside the box, trapping your cat inside.<br /><br />Avoid this product.
5;Only the best for my Pussing Foot Kitties;Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie for Cats: This is an expensive bit of tomfoolery for my kitty cats. When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also.
4;Medifast brownies;The brownies taste great.And are a great in between meal snack and keep me feeling full.
5;More puffed whole-grain goodness...;If you enjoy puffed whole grains, this is one of the best to eat because millet is very nutritious, and it is one of the few breakfast grains that is alkaline instead of acidic.<br />I like to toast these slightly in the oven for best results (these are very small puffed grains, so they will get soggy if you leave them sitting in milk too long), and at breakfast I mix them in my bowl with a sweeter flaked cereal to balance out the sweet taste with a more mild taste and different texture.
1;Misleading Picture and Description;This item sold and shipped by [..
3;Great pretzels but too expensive here;You can get these at your local Costco for less than 8 dollar, not worth what they are being sold for here.  Other than that they taste great.
5;Great Strawberries;These are really the best dried strawberries you can get.  They have no added sugar but they are extremely sweet and everyone enjoys them.
5;So much better than non organic;I love these beans, they cook better and taste better than the non organic ones and this is a GREAT price.<br />I also like the box that I can recycle with paper.
5;Great for Low-Carb Cheesecake Crust!;I purchased the almond flour with the intentions of making low carb pancakes, brownies and muffins. I also discovered it to be a great cheesecake crust alternative for those who are on a low carb diet.
5;I smile in the mornings now;If you enjoy smooth, strong, DELICIOUSNESS, please please please don't waste your time with other Keurig K-cups. I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain).
5;tea of the gods!!!;One sip of this tea, and I was hooked.  A sweet, mild, flavorful, green tea blend that needs no sweetener at all.
5;Very Good;I have never tried these kind of coffee products like this before. I was really pleased with the overall flavor and the aroma .
5;The True One and Only Original;All the other Herbs de Provence are imposters.  This is the only TRUE product that should bear the label, because as with all great French Epicurean items, there is a story with the Originale Recipe behind it.
4;Good corn;It is nice to have it all in one place. The corn is nice.
5;MBSlyDog;"Love good horse radish, and this is the BEST!!!  Always looking for the hottest I can find,  and I finally have, again.  Having worked in Restaurants, ""Atomic"" was available, but only in Costco size containers."
3;good, but doesn't taste exactly like peanut butter;I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that powdered peanut butter made with water is not as creamy or smooth as peanut butter made with oil. This product is yummy, and I do eat it, but I've found I eat more than I would if I were eating regular peanut butter because it's not as satisfying.
5;No more cramps!;I had been waking up with cramps in my feet and calves.  I only used one scoop in my juice once a day and this product stopped the cramps within a couple days.
1;Directions say to rinse;"This quinoa has to be rinsed!  I would not have ordered it if I had known that.  There are many other brands for the same price that DON""T require this annoying and messy step."
5;Delicious Tuna;I first tasted spicy canned tuna when a friend brought some back from Korea and I just had to have more. I was happy to come across this Bumblebee brand Spicy Thai Tuna and it was so good that I now buy it by the case.
5;Wonderful addition to my risotto;"The bottle containing the small amount of saffron notes that this product is ""the most expensive spice on earth."" I don't know much about that"
1;Don't waste your money;I have this fly trap up for over a month and a half and have caught maybe 5 flys.  This was a waste of money and I not be purchasing this item again and I would not recomend it to anyone.
5;An organic option that my kids loved!;I have 4 kids and I do try to offer them healthy options as much as possible.  I was happy to find this product at my local Target and my kids really liked this flavor.
3;rubber rope gone in 60sec;I have a 45lb lab mix that loves his busy buddy, but that cheap rubber rope lasted all of 20 min with him. He chewed it down to a nub.
1;Bitter after taste...;I thought I needed to clean my machine..
5;Tastes like water. HUGE bottle!;I'm basing my review on this being what it says it is. It's water! Yep! It sure is, and that is exactly what it tastes like.
5;Good stuff;Use cold rice milk with the Alive and Aware Cacao powder and stevia, wisk it.  Taste good and gives me energy.
5;very, very good;I just like bread that is natural, gives you something to chew and not bite off a piece sqeeze it between toung and gum and swollow it. The chewing process is so important to the whole digestive procedure.
3;Good, just not...really good;I'm not any kind of coffee snob since I usually kill it with creamer anyway, but I do love my flavored coffee, vanilla expecially.  I've had some mixed results with Starbucks coffee, generally preferring their plain roasts, but I've never tried Fusions.
4;easy great gnocchi, just needs sauce!;Makes for a quick, easy meal.  Wasn't sure what sauce to use so I grabbed sage and tomatoes from the garden and made a butter/sage sauce with cherry tomatoes.
5;Kick Start;I purchased this coffee for when I wanted to made double runs with my coffee maker.  For large cup sizes you can do a 10oz and then lift the lift like a new cup has been added and then do a 4oz or 8 oz on top of the orginal 10 oz.
5;No Scent and Works Great!;I gotta say that I am truly pleased with this cream rinse.  The first thing I noticed after opening was that it wasn't laden with perfume.
2;"They have that ""Almond Extract"" flavor";I love the taste of almonds, and I love almond butter.  I also love Betty Lou's Peanut Butter balls, which have a very natural peanut taste.
5;Vegetarian/Vegan staple;I have been using these for years. They are the best bouillon I have tasted, even comparing to ones that do have MSG and other questionable ingredients.
4;NOT DOP Certified! But Organic!;I received my order with a few problems. The majority of the cans arrived dented, some very severely! Amazon needs to add better packing material to keep the cans from moving around in the shipping box, I am surprised they haven't fixed this shipping issue by now because of all the complaints here in the reviews.
2;Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.;I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever.
5;great maker;i use this pot every day and it makes great coffee no matter what kind i use.  been using it about a year now and don't want another kind.
5;A Fabulous Frothy Dessert-Pumpkin Pie Matcha;I had some excitement at my mailbox yesterday when I found my package from Red Leaf tea and I knew my  Pumpkin Pie matcha had arrived. There was a bit of fall in the air and I love pumpkin pie, so I had high expectations.
5;Great Product;I was happy to find this newer creation of the renowned Angostora bitters brand. This type of orange bitters is quite clean and bright, very different from their traditional bitters recipe.
5;Best black tea!;After trying this tea at a friend's house, I hopped on Amazon and ordered my own. It is delicious and has a bold flavor, so if you're a coffee lover, you might enjoy this tea.
3;Very mild;"If you are looking for a strong ""Starbucks"" style coffee this isn't it. The mildest dark roast I have ever tasted."
5;Great value, great taste!;I have been purchasing soynut butter from the grocery store for many years.  Someone told me about this brand on Amazon so I thought I would give it a try.
5;Delicious!;Dr. Zevia has to be may favorite of all of the Zevia flavors (and I really do like them all).
5;My dogs love these, and Amazon's price was great;My dogs have chewed on a variety of Nylabone products for years.  We have the durable bones, dinosaurs, and wishbones.
5;YUMMY Gluten-Free Dairy-Free pancakes!;Love these! Pancakes were something I missed the most after going on a gluten-free diet 8 years ago, until now..
5;Wow!;This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced.
5;Excellent excellent excellent;This is a very tasty and refreshing little drink.  One of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere.
5;And I don't even like chocolate!;What a beautiful truffle- They are beyond heaven.  I took them to the shoppe I work at and yum yum, everybody liked them.
5;Great Buy!!;This was a great buy and the fact that shipping was free made it an awesome buy.  Since I am only one person, the 4 individual canisters will keep the coffee fresh until I am ready to use it.
5;Our dog 2;She likes these treats just as well as the Peanut Butter ones.<br />Really tries to show she should get one of her treats.
5;Caribou Decaf K Cups;Caribou Decaf K Cups are the greatest tasting coffee. You don't even know that it is Decaf.
5;say hi to the creator of these chips;Im the person who sent in tge idea fir these chips flavor. Thanks fir liking tge chips.
4;Cat likes it, but doesn't help tartar;My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms.
1;TERRIBLE Instant coffee- not brewed, instant.;This is just instant coffee in a kcup, it is not brewed coffee like the rest of the kcups.<br />The taste of it is terrible.
4;A nice alternative to sugary fruit rolls;We purchased the variety pack (strawberry, mixed berry, tropical, and sour apple) and overall are quite pleased with these. My daughter really enjoys the strawberry, berry and tropical flavors.
5;"What else would you call this but ""Calm?""";I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues..
4;Tasty with a lot of flavor;I agree with one of the other reviews.  As an adult, I find this flavor a little too strong and sweet.
5;Great With Orange Juice!;TASTE:<br />Ok, so with just water this stuff straight up tastes like rabbit food (no, I have never tasted it but I have smelled it). I didn't know how I was going to stomach this whole tub, even though the ingredients are incredible.
5;My cats love it.;This was recommended to me by my long-time vet after my 5 year old Russian Blue boy developed chrystals in hir urine and was hospitalized. She also recommedned the canned food she has in her office but my ctas wouldn't eat it.
5;Badoit is the best sparlkling water;I first tasted Badoit while in Switzerland and instantly became a fan.  Whilst in France 3 years ago, I was able to find this water just about anywhere.
4;Great Product, High Shipping Fee;Pleased with the product.<br /><br />Last Christmas I purchased my son a Carousel Jutebox Gumball Machine from Amazon.
3;It's Decent...;First off, let me describe my situation and usage of this product.  I'm usually stuck at work all day with nothing to eat except trail mix and nuts.
4;Very tasty.;This is my first experience with this particular brand of curry. My wife is the usual cook in the household, but she sprained her ankle pretty badly so I was given dinner duties last night.
5;Best of the K-cups;The Newman's is consistently our favorite of the K-cup varieties.  We try others, and usually keep a couple of selections available in our kitchen drawer, but we make sure we never run out of the Newman's.
5;superb quality;These cookies are beautiful. Everything about this tin of cookies was 10 star quality.
4;Delicious, with a catch...;I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess.
5;Licorice;Was as good as I remembered it being when I bought it in new Zealand. Thanks for the fast and efficient service.
5;Best gum ever!;I'm into maximizing health. I don't use any artificial sweeteners or refined sugars in any form.
1;Inconsistent in product quality;This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it.
2;Magical?;Senna tea is truly magical in the way it temporarily replaces your internal organs with bees.<br />I guess I must not be worthy enough in the constipation department to truly reap the benefits of Senna, and so the gods of this truly magical herb treated me instead to merciless abdominal pain and rear-ended agony.
5;wow what a seed;these big jars are fantastic.<br />just pop the lid and start chuggin.
5;Best taste, value and nutrition in a natural vegetable broth.  5 stars!;I'm a 20+ year user of Gayelord Hauser, All Natural Vegetable Broth with good reason.<br /><br />This stuff contains tons of Potassium which will rejuvenate you and keep you healthy.
5;Yum;Okay, maybe not yum for most, but I like Marmite.<br />It is a tangy smacking flavor best mated with some butter and toast.
5;GREAT CUPS;EXCELLENT BREW! TRIED OTHERS, ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE BEST. SELECT BLEND ONLY FOR SERIOUS COFFEE DRINKERS.
4;Compared to other Go Picnics, dried fruit took off a star;"I've tried the majority of the meals and this a good one.  Pepperoni is not only good but it's ""turkey pepperoni"" taking out some of the high fat."
4;Easy to use;This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key - it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray.
5;Mary's Gone Crackers Sticks & Twigs, Sea Salt;I love these crackers !!! They are so good I order them more often than I ever suspected I would !!! I definitely recommend them to my friends and family ..
5;Excellent spice, excellent price;I buy all my spices on amazon. The prices can't be beat if you are a relatively heavy user - which I am.
5;My Favorite Style;I absolutely love this product! I get the angel hair variety, too, but the rice-style is my favorite. It is so versatile and easy to use.
3;Crunch all the way;Enjoy twice the crunch: Kashi go-lean crunch is an intestinal wrecking ball. Fun to eat, tastes great and then.
5;Leprechaun Gold;I have to say I placed my order and was hopeing that these would be wonderful! Well I recieved them this morning,(very fast I must say!) and I am so very happy!!! the bag is beautiful! the Chocolate coins are beautiful!!!! and then I tried one(maybe two hehe) and these are wonderful!!!!! the chocolate is so yummy!!! We do Elf Magic Elves for Christmas who always leave little Chocolate coins along with other surprises, and usually just pick up a bag at Big lots, they are good..
5;Finally found them by the case!;I LOVE these cherries! I have been searching for a place to buy them by the case, since the local grocer is way too expensive (nearly $5 per bag!)  The price is excellent and the free shipping was icing on the cake..
1;Very bitter, burnt;I was hopeful that this would be a good cup.  What I received was a very bitter cup with a very bad aftertaste.
5;MADE BE A BELIEVER;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Game Changer;You are reading the review for a reason. The reviews speak for themselves.
4;Good flavor but not as sweet as I thought;I have used this in coffee, oatmeal and yogurt and it has a good toffee flavor.  However, it is not as sweet as other stevia products
5;Hemp seeds;Excellent company. I will definitely order from them again.
5;The Best Chips Ever;These chips are the greatest. I have ordered them several times--everyone loves them.
5;I LOVE IT!!;I drank one the day it came, right out of the box(warm)and really liked it. I like that the taste is mild.
5;its all good;I have 2 cats who are completely different..
4;I like these!;"These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler ""stuff."
5;Healthy, and kittens dig it;"I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything ""right"", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did."
5;My Malinois LOVES these!;This is the only thing that will keep my dog entertained instead of chewing my shoes. It's sanity in a ball for me and heaven for him.
5;Great salt;I bought this at the same time as the course salt and was very happy with both.  They are as they described.
5;Great snack!;This is a great late night snack for me replacing my usual pretzels.  I get the crunch and salt without any work yet it is much better for me than pretzels.
5;Wonderful flavor;I originally found this tea in a store in Nashville, TN, but have since moved.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it in any of my local stores.
5;It's my favorite coffee-;This is my favorite coffee out of the 18+ Kuerig cups that I've tried. It's smooth, and not too heavy or bitter.
5;Fantastic! (especially with a little half & half);This chocolate soda is absolutely fantastic.  It fends off the cravings for sweets very easily with its smooth taste.
5;Highest Rating.;"This product when received became an instant household staple I share with many others.<br /><br />The unsalted ""snack foods"" offered through Amazon can be delivered in case-quantity then set out at social events to introduce others to healthier eating."
5;You won't know you're eating low carb pasta;Took a chance, saw good reviews, bought one box of Angel Hair pasta.  Got it today.
4;Timothy's Midnight Magic Decaf;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Absolute garbage....  get a clue folks...;Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.
2;JUST NOT FOR ME!;OK..
5;Very Good Flavor;If your looking for very hot this is not it but if you are looking for a sauce with a little warmth and garlic flavor give it a try. It's hard to find in stores so I order two or three at a time.
5;Siimply the Best!;Good Sense Dietary Snack Mix is superior to many trail mixes.  It is excellent to use as a snack or to mix in with your breakfast cereal for that wholesome energy boost that you get from the all natural ingredients and no salt is added.
5;Delicious, soft and chewy.  Slightly larger than gummy bears.;If you or your kids want to have some reasonably healthy candy snacks, these fit the bill.  All three versions (Orchard, Tropical, and Fruit Medly) are good.
1;Baby developed yeast diaper rash after trying this cereal;I have been giving my 8 month old happy bellies for the last month and noticed that after a process of elimination, this cereal has caused my baby to have a yeast diaper rash. She loved eating it so I gave it to her daily.
5;Great For People with Milk Allergies;Almost all energy bars contain some kind of milk (or are cross-contaminated) so we were thrilled to find these for my milk-allergic daughter.  They taste fantastic
4;Warm and smooth, best with a couple of whiskey stones;Picked this up at the local ABC store where it was on sale as the last item of stock.  Ours was actually 15+ years old when we opened it, and it was deliciously smooth, with a lot of warmth and great mouth feel.
4;$8.97 for 16 ounces?;27 cents per ounce would make the 16 ounce container $4.32.
5;My dogs like it;Not only my logs like these snacks..
5;perfect maroon;This is the perfect maroon color.  I tried mixing several different colors together.
5;To die for!;I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life!  I had always thought that maple cream cookies were the best thing to happen to planet earth, until I tried these.  My Christmas present to myself this year: a box of these cookies and a canister of honey-roasted macadamia nuts.
5;Thanks!;Yum! Very good stuff. I especially like to use it in smoothies.
5;Deeeeelicious!;"""Mmm, mmm, good"" may be the copyrighted slogan for Campbell's soups, but it could also apply to Honey Maid's delicious crackers. They are a perfect snack with coffee or milk, and these Fresh Stacks are very convenient if, like me, you usually skip breakfast because the time you might spend eating is devoted to getting a few extra winks of sleep instead."
5;Hard to find elsewhere;These breakfast bars are nearly impossible to find in any traditional grocery stores or any other store around here for that matter.  I am always able to find here.
5;Excellent Tea;If you like Earl Grey tea you will love Zhena's version..
5;A Feast For the Most Finnicky Furry Feline;This food is a delight to give to one of the most important members of the family.  She's a bit choosy & will walk away readily from many foods.
5;My favorite of the WP K cups.;Nice round flavor. Not harsh or botter.
1;Waste Plastic Packaging for Taco Shells;"The so-called ""Freshness Pack"" inside the cardboard box is a vacuum-formed PLASTIC BOX (#7-Generally not recyclable) with a clear plastic pull-back lid.  Yikes!  All this waste for tortillas?  Throwaway plastic waste gone mad."
3;Carbonated watermelon juice in a can;I found this drink interesting in terms of taste
5;The best panettone;I tried several different kinds and this one is the absolute best. It is so moist and chewy, with an amazing smell when you open the box.
5;I LOVE THIS COFFEE, IT IS THE SMELL OF MORNING;I love this coffee, I am waiting for a new shipment.  I was not smart enough to order before I was out and now I am making everyone around me miserable, because I don't have my kicking horse.
5;Oh, yum, this is good!;This smells wonderful and that's just the beginning.  Very smooth flavor with the overtones of chocolate.
5;New to eating hempseeds;After reading about all the health benefits of hempseeds, I went ahead and bought this 5-pound bag of them even though I've never eaten them before (coming from an islander culture, I was always taught to learn about and respect the healing qualities of various foods). Another reviewer here said that these hempseeds taste like raw pine nuts, and I would agree with that.
5;Perfect Lady Fingers;Excellent lady Fingers!!! I have used them several times and they are perfect. I will order again.
5;Awesome Alternative;"Well, I was worried after reading the reviews, but ended up pleasantly surprised with these ""noodles.""  If you follow the instructions, which are very clear, they taste like asian celophane noodles."
5;Fantastic Product;I recently started my own ice cream and snack truck and have been trying different products out. This brand is easily my favorite.
4;Good for bad bellies;I have a very sensitive stomach and cannot use GUs. I am a long distance runner and have enjoyed these sports beans.
5;Great Dog Treat;We have dogs with food allergies and these are some of the only snacks we can give them.  They love them and the vet told us they are ok to give them, so we are very happy to have found them.
2;Banana Chocolate Chip Bars that taste like Fig Newtons;If you are a person who is used to eating healthy products, and especially Kashi products, you may very much enjoy this snack bar. But if you are looking for a snack bar that tastes like banana and chocolate chips, the name of this variety of snack bar, you may be (like me) quite disappointed.
4;Great flavor;These roll ups have a good variety of flavors. Everyone I gave some to loved the mixed fruit roll ups.
5;Pass the TVP.;I used to get this in the grocery store, but it seems to be unavailable now. I am happy to find this product again.
4;Really Good;I have bought several varieties of Snyder's pretzels on Amazon Warehouse. Like all of them.
1;Way too sour!;Given the great reviews for these, I took the chance and ordered some.  I love sour fruit snacks and so do my three kids so I was excited to get these.
3;TOTALLY LOVE POPCHIPS!;I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.
5;lays dip smooth ranch;love this product. it is so tasty.
5;Kool-Aid excellent;I'm please with this purchase, the kool-aid taste is very good. You get a lots for the price.
4;one of my favorites;These are one of my favorite ways to eat grains  Plus they are a good source of protein.  17 chips per serving is just about right.
4;Yummy chips;These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving.
5;My Favorite Coffee;The title really says it all.  I have tried so many different types of K-cups and Tree Hugger is full flavored and smooth, and not at all bitter.
3;Okay..not great.. impulse;Stop..
1;DO NOT ORDER IF YOU LOVE EARL GREY!;Let the buyer beware! These are not individually wrapped tea bags which are what led me to fall in love with Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey. What you will receive are six boxes of 50 tea bags that are produced with inferior bags.
5;great coffee;Love this product!I put in smaller vacuum-sealed bags & froze.If you love caffeine,you will love this great tasting coffee.
1;Crap.;Five hour energy is junk.  It tastes awful, doesn't work, and is way overpriced.
5;Mum-Mum = Yum-Yum;My LO loves these.  She started eating them @ about 9 months.
5;I love lavender!;I am in love with these lavender chocolate chip cookies. I could eat an entire bag in one sitting.
1;NOT PRODUCED IN THE U.S.A.;"My wife and I ordered these for our 1 year old to snack on. We are not ""it has to be organic people"" but we do like items grown in the U."
4;Pretty Good;I enjoy this tea very much. Not an over powering mint taste, but afterall it is green tea and not mint tea.
5;Dogs like them;My dogs think these Chicken Zuke's Minis are really tasty. The only problem for me is that the treats are so tiny, that my 90lb German Shepherd swallows them as if they're dust.
5;Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!;My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.
5;Can't live without it!;This is the most spectacular condiment. I am a foodie.
5;Pretty good cup of coffee;I struggled for a bit to find a K-cup that was strong enough for my coffee tastes. I am not sure if this one has the strength I need, but it has  the strong flavor that I enjoy.
5;Pretty Darn Good.. smooth;I tried the boardwalk blend,The package says smooth, medium roast with some extra bold flavor<br /><br />I would say the description if pretty accurate.  I did not have an problem with execution in my<br />machine like some people are writing about.
5;Love It;Healthy..
5;Zukes Dog treats;My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.<br /><br />I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
5;Great in the morning;My pick for first coffee in the morning. Not too bold, not too light, nice straight-up cup of flavor.
5;Great coffee;This is currently my favorite coffee..
5;Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health;I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.
1;Another waste of money...;Another disappointing product from Elevages Perigord. Pate? More like carpenter's glue mixed with very fine sawdust.
5;Unbelievable snack;I ordered these as a suggestion from the Hungry Girl Website, my husband and I Love them.  No nasty after taste, delicious and still healthy.
1;Milkyway review;Iorder these for my husband. The first order was great.
5;Crispy & light!;I just made some in my Whirley Pop.  It really is lighter and crisper than the larger, yellow kernels.
3;Picture is of the LARGE bar like the ones at Cracker Barrel.....;But the candy I received are the small bars - less than 1.5oz each.
3;Older dog;My Basset 12+ yrs. old does wolf these down in minutes however at her age it is totally worth it to me too.
5;Tea;This is repeat order, my wife loves this tea and drinks it every day. She has others, but this is her favourite.
1;Flavorless;This was dissapointing. So much so that I wouldnt waste another second on talking about it except to say Im tossing the product because it was lacked any taste whatsoever and I wouldnt want to inflict the nothing on another being.
5;Delicious;Just love the mint hint in this chocolate. It has a wonderful flavor (unlike other mint chocolates I've tried.
5;Delicious;I am very happy with this product..
5;Excellent stuff;I bought about 5 different kinds of K-cups when I first got my coffee maker, which I love by the way, and I'd have to say that this was my favorite one out of them all. It has the perfect balance of everything, I was really surprised.
5;spiced peaches;wonderful old fashioned spiced peach flavor.  Fruit was firm and tasty.
4;Great taste for the price;This is my go-to tea now.  Even when I over-brew it (~10 min) it still tastes good.
4;Tasty Granola Bar Snack;"As a guy, I don't need these as a ""sensible snack"" but rather a snack to tide me over until lunch or as an addition to my morning yogurt for breakfast. Calorie-wise they are comparable to other granola type bars."
5;Great way to give pills!;My dog LOVES these. They're very soft in texture, easily hides the capsule, almost looks like a Hersheys Kiss when concealing the pill, my dog just swallows it down!<br />Thanks Hoovea and Paws.
4;A Mild Taste That Pleases;I normally enjoy my coffee with a little bit of a kick to it.  I'm a fan of strong coffee that slaps you around and wakes you up in the morning.
5;Only sugar we use.;I order a vast quantity of this sugar about twice a year.  We use it on everything.
4;Good, not great;I received the Kind Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar as a free sample. Since it was free, I enjoyed it, but would not pay the high price to buy it.
5;Excited to try this!;This product arrived in great shape, very promptly. I'm excited to give it a try and see how it responds.
5;Good size for training;My dog loves these and they're my training treats of choice.  I've only tried the chicken flavor.
5;Tasty snack that sooths baby's gums;Our 9 1/2-month old daughter LOVES these teething biscuits! We initially tried them upon recommendation from another Mom in our Mommy & Me group.  The biscuits can be rather messy as they disintegrate but part of this may be due to the fact that our daughter only had one tooth at the time we introduced these teething biscuits
5;Gluten Free Cookies - Very Good!!;We bought these along with the Walnut Biscotti, as an Easter treat for our relatives with celiac disease. We decided we had to try them first to make sure they tasted all right.
4;Even my husband likes them!;I think this has a nice vanilla flavor. not too strong, but good.
5;Shipped Fast! Bought as Gift for Family Bereavement;One family I know has had a very stressful time of it, loosing a loved one last year, and having another loved one pass away at the same time another family member was getting married earlier this week.<br /><br />Having looked over flower arrangements at various florist websites online, I realized there'd still be flowers from the wedding, and frankly too many flowers after a death in the family can become overwhelming.
4;Good coffee and fair trade;Good coffee and its a fair trade product so you can feel extra great inhaling the scent and complex yet simple flavors yet knowing you've helped the earth and the people on it a bit in your small way. Each drop of rain causes a ripple in a lake.
4;Love them now - not so much earlier;I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.
5;Rum Goodies;"This is, by far, the best Collins mix on the market. I mix it with rum to make what I and my entire family enjoy as ""Rum Goodies""."
5;Yummy;These are the best chips ever. I order them by the case because you can't buy 5 oz in the store and it is just enough.
5;My favorite powdered milk product...;it arrived double boxed. the saco milk box has a plastic bag full of powdered milk in it.
5;Sugar Free Caramel is delicious;This is one of my favorite sugar free flavors and I've tried at least five of them. It's right up with with Almond Roca and Hazelnut.
5;Great little treat;I love getting organic treats for my kids. I tried these and they are YUM.
5;Excellent Tea;If you are a tea drinker taste this one you will drink no other after.<br />I have tried them all but this is the only one I drink now.
5;great-tasting coffee!;"This is one of my favorite K-cup varieties, along with <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Absolutely delicious -- and addictive;One of the best store-bought cookies I've ever tasted ..
5;Good price on a flavorful tea;I'm always waiting for packaged teas to go on sale, so I was delighted to find Stash at the subscribe and save page.  Very flavorful tea, good iced or hot.
2;OK, but not special;Taste very similar to Lipton's loose leaf tea. If you prefer the kind that looks more like chopped leaves than something that's been ground & almost looks like coffee, this isn't for you.
5;My Siberian Husky loves it;My Siberian Husky is very picky with food, and can easily get sick from treats, so I bought the small bag to see if she liked it, or get sick, or not, and she loves it, she knows when is training time, or when she does something really good that deserves a reward, because of the sort of strong smell. The only issue I have with it is that this is extremely hard to break in smaller pieces, and if the pieces are too small for the dog, it can be dangerous for the dod, that is the only reason I won't get any more until she is an adult.
5;My cat LOVES these;My cat went crazy for these.  They completely covered her pills and she had no idea she was eating medicine.
4;Good jerky;Me and the missus went through this pretty quick..
4;"""JET FUEL"" By Coffee People From AMAZON";This is the best Full Flavored Coffee I can find for K-Cups and Amazon has the best price. K-Cup coffee appealed to us because my Wife and I have such different tastes.
5;Good value and fast shipping;This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base.
5;My beagle's favorite treat;Chaz goes bonkers once a night, when she figures it's Dingo time! No day is complete for her without a Dingo. So, from my dog's perspective, they're a 5 star treat.
5;Yes, it's expensive but...;SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.
5;Good Flavor;I bought these here at Amazon because this was the best deal I could find for my money. I even saved more on auto-shipment.
5;Awesome Flavor;This coffee has amazing flavor and aroma.  You can really taste the coconut in this blend.
5;Money saver!!;"As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the ""My Kcup"" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer."
5;awesome;Best one yet.If you have not tried this one yet your missing out very tender and moist nuggets.
5;Great tasting high protein snack!;The flavor of these protein chips are perfect to stop the snack cravings.  Because of the high protein count, I don't feel guilty eating these.
3;Tastes ...different;I tried this almond flavor tonight and found it reminded me of soap. The liquid is thick and merely tasting it in a raw application gave me a slight stomach ache.
5;Dogs love it, Price not so great;My dogs love this product but I can buy it locally for $5.00 cheaper than Amazon charges.
5;Move over Nexxus, this is just as good, if not better;I am really picky about my shampoos/conditioners, and was SO dubious when Amazon sent me this item to review.<br />I have colored, fine hair, which frizzes easily and breaks often.
5;Fast, easy and baby loves it!;I love this product because it is so delicious and so simple to prepare - I only add warm water and have dinner or lunch or breakfast ready within seconds. I also take it on trips because I don't need to add milk or formula, just warm water.
3;Meh.;It's not terrible.  But it's nothing worth writing home about and definitely not worth the price, in my opinion.
4;Great food - on a slow mule.;I love Swiss Colony foods.  Perhaps not as much as Hickory Farms, but their summer sausage is quite delectable.
4;Not exactly sure how to rate this;I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it.
5;Very nice basketWas;This was purchased for my daughter and her husband.  I was very pleased with the selection of items in the basket.
4;Love me some Bliss!;Honestly, I really enjoy this product.  B6 and B12 are great for boosting the mood, so I have read, and chamomile has always worked extremely well for me as a sleep aid/anxiety reducer.
5;Figgy Pudding was GREAT!;"We were inspired to make Figgy Pudding after Christmas caroling with our Church.  The song, ""We wish you a Merry Christmas"" has two verses that talk about Figgy Pudding - so off to a search engine, and what do you know we had to order figs - none found in the local stores."
5;Excellent for a gluten-free snack!;I've ordered these twice now - and enjoy one with coffee in the morning at work.  For some they might be a bit too sweet but for me they're just right.
5;Yum, yum, yum;Always loved halvah, and Joyva's is delicious. These are just the right size for a quick treat, and in quantity like this, very affordable.
4;Health claims aside, it's a unique tasting water;There are a number of interesting studies surrounding alkaline water and its health benefits.  A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.
5;FINALLY a treat for my dog that lasts!;I am so glad that I purchased this item for my dog.  I have a golden retriever that is a very aggressive chewer.
5;To steal a tagline...mmm, mmm good!;This stuff is awesome! It has the right amount of spice (a-lot) and the noodles are much thicker and more flavorful than the standard $.10 a pack stuff.
5;Great candy;My husband is going through Chemo and these candies seem to take the bad taste out of his mouth.  I love them too, pretty addicting.
5;Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!;This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding.
2;Weak, even on small cup setting;This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.
5;Great buy!;I have gotten into the habit and decided to save some money by buying in bulk. Great decision! All poptarts have been fresh and the expiration dates are a while away.
5;Love it.;The tins arrived in a timely manner, and there was no damage in shipping.  The oats are easy to fix, and delicious.
1;Buy Pro-pest instead;I bought both Safer and Pro-pest brands of moth traps for closet moths. Both are basically flypaper with a pheromone purported to attract male moths.
5;Terrific Cereal;After eating this cereal years ago, i was hooked. Now i can't find it in my city.
5;Good;This is good dog food, but I stopped buying it, because one of my dogs (I have two) did not like it. She is not a big fan of can food in general.
5;Awesome!;The Ranch flavored Cornnuts are the best flavor offered!  Everyone in our house, as well as other friends, agree that these are a winner.  The Ranch taste is right on mark and he perfect balance of seasonings and saltiness.
4;trigirl;A very enjoyable sweet treat
5;Good Flavor, Not;"We always keep a package of these handy.  They make great snacks when you aren't really hungry but have the ""the munchies"", grab a handful and you're all set."
5;my favorite;I found just enough of this product to be totally addicted. Now I can't find it anywhere, how come?<br />It was the perfect blend to add to my morning hot cereal.
5;treats;this order was long over due and when I let Amazonknow they expressed it overnight, which I am thankful because my dog was out and I was afraid I would have to pay a higher price at the store.  I do not intend to do business with this person or co.
5;If you like sour and sweet then you are in for a TREAT!;These really are DELICIOUS! My favorite sweet of all time. Chef Eric's in a nice brand, it's popular in Jamaica among other places.
5;Love Those Jordans;I moved and could find these locally so I went online. These were great they came promptly and in perfect condition.
5;Picky Pug Picks Poppers;These are a great product.  My extremely picky pug surprised me when she actually ate one of these and wanted more.
5;Dogs love 'em, I love 'em;My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good.
4;mandoline food slicer;This mandoline works well, slices fairly easily.<br />The only drawback is the amount of supports which hold water after I wash it.
4;Like It;Very Good for baking.  I love that it has a low glycemic index, so not so bad for diabetics.
5;as expected;I was very happy with this product.I was able to get it shipped to me for over $10 less I would pay at a gas station.
5;Delivered to the door right on schedule;What a great way to get heavy items like dog food from an affordable and dependable source. I usually by my dog food in a discount box store rather than my local grocery store.
5;Tastes good;Not sure where all the bad reviews are comming from, I bought two cases to take camping with me. The first bottle tasted just as good as the last.
5;Simply Fiber;I am a senior citizen who has been eating this cereal daily for the past 4 years to ensure I am cleaned out every day. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you buy Simply Fiber over any other high fiber cereal because: 1) It really works, 2)NO Salt or Sugar, 3) High protein, 4) No preservatives.
5;great find;"Olives like these were our favorite at the olive stand on the ""Albert Cuyp"" market when we still lived in Amsterdam. So happy I found these online."
5;Great on-the-go snack;As someone else mentioned, the taste is somewhat reminiscent of the peanut butter Girl Scout sandwich cookies.  As a college student, I just throw some of these in my backpack and when hunger strikes these are ready at hand.
4;Daybreak;Currently our preferred morning coffee. Not too strong, not too light and all the flavor one needs.
5;Like being back in Italy;The Illy is the best commercial Italian coffe that you can find not only in the USA but in Italy too. It is pricy but it is really worth all the money that you spend on it.
4;A Favorite Oolong;"Tieguanyin Tea translated into English as ""Iron Goddess Tea"" is one of the most famous types of Chinese Tea. It has many different translations and is often called Tieguanyin, Ti Kuan Yin, Tikuanyin, Iron Buddha, Iron Goddess Tea, and Iron Goddess of Mercy Tea."
4;Annie Chun;I haven't found anything from Annie Chun that I do not like.  It's ALL good.
4;Good stuff;These have a great cruch factor and are very satisfying.<br />Low cal and are really good in soups as garnish!<br />I like the Sea salt variety the best.
5;Excellent Treat for Your Pets!;After receiving my order from Amazon I found all the items specified in the Mini Organic Pet Grass Kit. The instructions were very well written, easily comprehensible for even novice green thumbs and accurate.
5;Best so far!;This is the best coconut oil I've tried so far! The flavor is amazing, the purity and texture is perfect! Not too bad on the price either, especially when shipped with FREE 2day shipping via Amazon Mom/Prime.<br /><br />I use coconut oil for many many things, as my 2 year old is allergic to butter/milk etc.
3;Cooking mama;Sadly  these rice papers were very fragile.  They ripped in every roll.
5;EXQUISITE CHOCOLATE!;This is the best Belgian Chocolate I've tasted. The shipping to the customer is first rate.
4;little bambinos;Tried the popcorn on my little bambino popper machine . I am very happy with the results .
5;Great Snack ~ Great Taste;A little harder to find than most of the other Larabars..
5;Delicious Expresso;I'm no coffee snob so take this with a grain of salt.  Our cappucinos taste great!  We grind it super fine and pack semi-tightly into the portafilter (apparently, this is the steel basket w/ handle) and the result is a strong, flavorful espresso.
5;The best!;This gluten free oatmeal has very simple ingredients, so I can eat oatmeal for my health and not have to worry about unnecessary ingredients or gluten. Because of that it is the best tasting instant oatmeal I've ever had period.
5;Nice Company!;I got the product I wanted in a nice time plus free samples of similar products!  Thanks! Now if only my boyfriend didn't drink it all..
1;If there were no other coffee in the house;..
5;Excellent;Excellent source of magnesium that helps you (1) Fall asleep at night withOUT harmful sleeping meds (2) allows smooth bowel movements consistently. And you control how much you are going to ingest.
5;If used properly, Safer Brand effectively controls moths;Not too long ago, our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths. To this day, she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home, but the facts speak for themselves.
4;Pamela's Products Ultimate Baking Mix;My daughter has Celiac's disease so I purchased this product to use as a substitute for Bisquick baking mix.  It wasn't as easy as I hoped to mix up with the Crisco for the recipe I was using it for (an impossible pie).
5;Great chips;Great potato taste and crunch with so much less fat than regular chips. The order arrived promptly and in good condition.
4;Not very plump;I bought vanilla beans from here before, and they were large and plump. This time, I was disappointed.
5;Always the best dried fruit!;I have ordered these cherries over and over again for myself and for gifts and I am always pleased.  The cherries are of superior quality and taste - I will continue to order these and other products from Traverse Bay.
1;YUCK!;I've been eating tamarind and tamarind paste since I was 3 years old, I ordered this product and was really excited to taste it. My tamarind paste came in the mail today, and once I put it in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up.
5;Great Coffee Great Price;The coffee is very good and the price is unbeatable. This out beats even costco and I don't have to leave home.
5;Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula for Cats;Our cat requires food that is formulated to go easy on the urinary tract.  Purina One has served that purpose for years.
3;Very Dry and Salty;It is VERY DRY, CHEWY and SALTY. So dry and chewy that my tooth hurts.
5;LOVE IT!;This is an amazing product and we just love it!  The quality of the truffle oil is excellent and the customer service at JR mushrooms and specialties is even better.  They had accidentally shipped the black truffle oil, and when I contacted them, they were extremely professional and courteous.
3;the taste;This product gets 3 stars from the taste alone. Most protein shakes taste like chalk mixed with milk.
2;Weak Hot Chocolate With A Fancy Name;Very disappointed in General Foods International Coffees! I've purchased their retail tins previously and thought these bags were that same product in bulk..
3;Too sweet;The texture of this jerky is good, and it's very moist compared to other turkey jerky I've had. However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet.
1;Dont buy this on line!;I have had this Arctic Zero before in strawberry and I liked it.  I ordered it after reading the reviews that it arrived hard as a rock.
5;Great company, Great food!;I've done my fair share of research on dog food.  I went from the Wellness Super5Mix, which was a good dog food but gave my dog some bad gas and still had fillers in it.
5;Green Tea Super Antioxidant;This review is for the Green Tea Super Antioxidant. I can see many of the flavors are being reviewed under one product here.
2;Not tasty;My daughter loves many of the Sprout meals but this one she absolutely loathed. Simply no taste! I'm not surprised she fussed each time I tried to give her a bite.
5;Very Nice;I really enjoyed this product and will purchase it again. Each bag seems to be a perfect size and at a very nice price.
4;Has a Nice Subtle Taste of Cinnamon;Quaker Oatmeal Squares are smaller in size than one would expect, especially in comparison with some other cereals. The dietary information is encouraging as there is fairly low sodium, 190 mg per 1 cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber along with 6 grams of protein.
5;Fast Red;No more sore wrists from mixing and mixing. One squirt and a few stirs and you have a nice bright red.
5;Best dog treats out there!;Our dogs love these treats. AND from the treater's perspective, they smell great - like cookies I'd eat.
5;Three generations of skinner's fans!;My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal.
5;Excellent Quality at GREAT Price;I have tried quite a few different brands of Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil and this has got to be one of the best.  I use it for everything.
5;Just hot water;The caramel ones tastes great with just hot water!<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet..
4;Great service;I got my second delivery of Timothy K cups on time as requested. I have joined the coffee club so the price is cheaper and they ship for free.
4;Dog tested, Mom approved (mostly);Boy did I ever test this out.<br /><br />Each morning after the kids get on the bus, the dogs get a quick walk around the neighborhood park.
5;Perfect price point;After my vet insisted my two cats (11 yo & 2 yo) needed to be on a wet food only diet, I went on a hunt to find the best one.  Out of the dozens of brands I tried, the food was either too expensive, my cats didn't like it, or the nutritional value looked sketchy.
3;average;Only popped a couple pounds but seemed ok with some unpopped that is normal to me. We have a 6 oz paramount machine that i love to use for popping.
5;In a word... WOW!;I have tried both, the regular and the chocolate and I think I may be the first person to prefer the regular lol. The chocolate is ok, but I am not a fan of dark chocolate, which this reminds me of.
5;To die for!;Love these!<br /><br />Too bad they're unavailable now, but when I bought my bag, I found these to be fresher than the competition and appropriately priced.  They are a little more spendy, but boy do they taste amazing!<br /><br />The dark chocolate on the outside is smooth and bitter-sweet
5;AWESOME DEAL!;I love quinoa and being a vegan I eat LOTS of it. I was purchasing all of mine at the farmers market and even on sale it is costly (because I buy organic) This is an amazing deal.
5;We love it;We use this in soda water to make delicious soda that's not terrible for you.  The vanilla creme makes wonderful creme soda.
5;best feline cat food;My cats love this food.  They pick at other brands or won't eat it at all so I decided to try this brand.
5;Great item;This item has a nice flavor.  It is soft and easy to use and it keeps well in a sealed container.
5;Fantastic candy really expresso filled!!!  Great;This candy is by far the best Expresso candy I have ever had.  I will be buying more soon.
4;Do NOT taste like sugar free cookies.;Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed.
4;A better malt.;This product is very hard to find in stores. The price is right, and is always fresh when we recieve it.
5;The Best Cooking Oil -- EVER!;I still can't believe this isn't sold at my local supermarket. We use this oil on virtually everything! Baked chicken tenders taste like fried with a little spritz of this stuff.
5;Great StarKist tuna in a ready to eat pouch, and crackers;Our family loves tuna, and it was nice to find these grab-and-go lunch packs.  The tuna in the pouch is moist but not soggy, and the crackers are fresh and plentiful.
3;Where's the peach?;The taste of tangerine overpowers any peach flavor that may be in this tea.  We've only made iced tea, and we enjoy it, but I was really looking for a white tea with peach flavor.
5;YUM!!!!  This really is delicious!;This is worth the try - it is so much healthier than a regular mocha and the chocolate flavor is excellent!  I do recommend using a blender (I use my Magic Bullet) for about 30-60 seconds to blend it all together.  That makes it so creamy you can't tell it was from a powder.
5;yorkshire tea loose;wonderful tea! not like those bagged teas with no flavor! will buy again!the tea is delicate flavor with smooth undertones. good with desserts or just an evening rest.
5;Works, economical alternative to other 'diet' teas;This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed.
4;Honestly, I bought this for the name.;Honestly, I bought this for the name.  I've got a friend who also has a Keurig who is a little right of Cheney who'll get the second box as a gag gift.
5;The best gingerale, bar none!;I grew up in Detroit, which way back when was an absolutely beautiful city (1960s, before the race riots).  The city has been on a decline, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, ever since.
1;Maruchan Yakisoba, Teriyaki Beef Flavor, 4-Ounce Microwavable Containers (Pack of 8);"I ordered these, thinking (hoping) that they would taste similar to the same item manufactured by ""Nissan"". They arrived timely and packaged well without any complaints, however the taste is nothing at all compared to the quality of the Nissan brand of teriyaki noodles."
1;Very poor Quality;I was very excited to get some more Silver Needle Tea.  Their price was competitive but no cheap by any means.
1;Just Terrible.;We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.
5;It seemed to choose me;On a friend's recommendation, I tried one can of Verve.  I was skeptical because it was carbonated, and I've given up sodas.
5;Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans;I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food.
2;Like eating hot coals only less tasty;If you want heat and don't give a damn what it tastes like, or plan to add it as a minor ingredient just to add heat, then this is your sauce. It is hotter than hell's kitchen.
5;Disney Sprinkles;This is the same sprinkles that Disney uses on their desserts made in the resorts in Florida. I made cupcakes just like theirs.
5;Souper Service;Our local Safeway stopped carrying this item, so, I turned to Amazon. Good price, good service, quick delivery.
1;Cat owner;I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats .
2;They changed the flavor..2 grams of fat version is less tasty;I used to eat the Austin animal crackers that contained 1.5 grams of fat per serving (2 servings per package for a total of 3 grams of fat).
4;"Love ""squishy fruit""";"My family loves ""squishy fruit"" but this one is my husband's favorite (yes, we adults love them too!). My husband is a super picky eater but actually enjoys this and says it is a good ""sweets"" substitute."
5;good product, good price;Having this product at home by the case saves me from making a special trip to the oriental grocery store. I was, and am, absolutely delighted with these noodles.
1;Major Mistake;I ordered the variety packs but instead received just chocolate and vanilla.  I honestly don't know if they made a mistake or ran out of the variety and sent me the chocolate and vanilla instead.
1;Every can was dented!;"My order arrived yesterday and every one of the 12 cans was dented - some had small dents while others were badly crushed. Was this just a bad batch or are these factory ""seconds""?<br /><br />Followup on this order: I just received an email from Amazon and they are refunding the full purchase price of this order."
5;Robust Coffee;I like strong coffee, and jet fuel is one of my favorites. The Keurig individual packages ensure that the coffee always taste fresh.
3;Smells great and is organic, but not favorite organic decaf;When I received this product, it smelled so good and fresh! For me personally, however, I prefer the Marques de Paiva organic decaf taste. While I definitely will still finish this coffee, it is not as smooth as Marques and sort of smoky tasting (I am not a coffee expert so I am not sure of the correct description words).
5;Restful mmmm;The product is fresh, with clear instructions on how to use it.  A very calming cup of tea
5;Limoncho;This stuff tastes amazing though and everyone I share with loves it! Although I am sure the seller did not mean to mislead buyers, each individual limoncho container is .4 oz and not 4 oz like written in the description.
1;Terrible Coffee - Acidic Flavor;This coffee tastes terrible. It's got a very chemically, acidic taste, and no matter what type of creamer I use to change the flavor, it's still terrible.
5;Awesome taste, portability and convenience.  Cheaper than buying coffee at Starbuck's.;This coffee tastes great.  Sometimes a cup of coffee in my office is so bad I just won't drink it.
5;Mixers Without Massive Sugar Shocks;"This is the best mixer I have come across for all those who either are limiting their sugar intake or who just don't want an ""ultra-sweet"" cocktail.  This makes a good consmopolitan with a jigger of vodka and a lemon peel."
1;Not so happy mommy;While I typically like the Happy baby products, I was very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time.
5;Carnation Instant Breakfast;Delicious! I love this product for when I'm in the go and can't eat a meal. It is packed with vitamins and curbs my appetitie for about 4 hours.
5;Chef Christina;Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup is the best on the market. Sweet, clear and smooth.
5;This Stuff Is Great!;A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.
4;Delicious but dangerous;I like it because of the following reasons:<br />Maple syrup gives good aroma,<br />Pecan nuts provides healthy fat, and<br />cereal is crisp.<br />These satisfy me.
1;Not bad, but not good either;When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa.
5;Superior product!;Eastman casings are the best I've found online. They are cleaner and a superior product to some I have purchased.
5;Manna from heaven;Stash makes quality teas all the time, but this Peach Black Tea is simply the best.  It makes a heavenly iced tea.
5;Dark Magic;I love good coffee and for medical reasons must drink Decaf.  Emeril's Dark Magic Decaf tastes rich and flavorful, just like real caffinated coffee.
3;Less spicier than the real Korean version;I guess NongShim made this as export version as they do with many many other noodle products.<br />Usually they are much less spicy.
5;Madagascar Vanilla Beans;These Vanilla Beans arrived in an air tight sealed plastic..
5;The best tasting honey...;I discovered this honey while visiting family in Michigan at a fabulous gourmet grocery store called Papa Joe's in Birmingham (a suburb of Detroit).  This Canadian honey is seriously the best clover honey I have ever tasted--I will continue to buy it for me and my husband, and this is the best price I've found.
5;Dogs love'em;I was introduced to these treats when I took my dogs to the vet, and saw her giving them these treats.<br />The dogs went crazy for them!<br />Not only that, but there is nothing in this but pure liver.
2;Wasn't the same as description;There is a list of 18 items in the description of this basket. I only received 16 and a couple of them were duplicates.
5;THE ONLY THING MY 3-YEAR-OLD WILL EAT FOR BREAKFAST!;Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.
5;Booda Bone Dog Treats, 9 Pack;My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.
5;dude. . .now you have a lot of fish flakes.;This bag is about as big as a pillow and you can use it as such, or cook the contents of it or feed it to your cat. I'm in the process of feeding them to my cat.
5;Great product, no recalls;I was looking for good quality limited antigen ingredient diet that has not had a recall in last few years. This is no easy task, but Pinnacle is one of those diet.
5;Great for flavoring a pitcher of iced tea;I find most flavored teas too strong for a single brewed cup -and I prefer iced tea, so I make a pitcher of iced tea with regular tea bags and just one these tea bags included - adds a nice subtle fruity flavor that isn't overpowering.  I swtiched from soft drinks to iced tea as my beverage of choice, so this allows me to vary the iced tea flavors to keep them from getting boring.
5;Our cats love it! Natural Balance is the best!;I've been feeding our two cats this for over a year now and they still love it. One of them has always been a little hefty and after moving he is forced to be an indoor cat, causing him to gain weight.
5;Pleasantly surprised !;Loving the Greenmountain Nantucket K-cup .  I like a variety of coffee.
5;Absolutely to Die For!;This was by far the best coffee cake I've ever had! I love my coffee and chocolate and it had the perfect amount of each flavor. It was still super moist when delivered and came packaged nicely.
4;Excellent quality nourishment;I appreciate Halo's attention to the health of our pets by providing high quality products.  My 17-year-old poodle/bishon mix has been using Halo Adult Dog Food for several years and trots around like a pup.
5;yummy peanut butter;I really enjoy them.  I found out about them the last weekend of Passover when I was visiting my family in New York.
5;Great for ice coffee;During the summer I like to add lots of ice to my coffee and make it cold. However adding lots of ice will tend to dilute the coffee and make it bland.
3;Nice coffee but a little acid;It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.
1;Stale;I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this.
5;Yummy;Great snack for little ones (and grown ups too)! Nothing but real fruit and tastes delicious. They are a quick boost of energy.
5;Coconut oil is the healthy option;Coconut oil is the healthiest oil you can cook with.  This brand tastes great and has a light flavor that doesn't obscure the taste of the food that's being cooked.
5;Only feed Holistic;A premium holistic dog food.  My last two dogs lived to be 18-19 years of age.
5;Best flavor k cup;This one of the best kcup flavors available.  Great on a brisk fall day.
5;This is a great blend;I purchase this at my local butcher shop and love it. I use it on my homemade pizzas all the time.
5;Really works;I've tried several energy products, both drinks and pills, and 5-hour energy is my favorite.  It certainly gives me a kick of energy but doesn't leave me jittery or anxious at all.
5;Chocolate Zico !;Sinful ! I am a regular drinker of Zico Natural and recently tried the new chocolate. It is smooth and creamy, almost like a liquid Almond joy! Still all natural with the same electrolyte and potassium benefits, I would highly recommend.
5;Good customer service;First off, this is one of the only companies that would ship me this stuff at my APO address.  You'd be amazed at who won't ship what out here.
5;Excellent replacement for Rice;We have replaced our rice portions with this brand Quinoa and it worked out perfectly for us. Helps you a lot in controlling your weight, especially if you want to avoid carbs from your daily rice intake.
3;Natural flavor is NOT neutral;"I bought the ""natural"" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake."
2;flowed beautifully, but tasted awful;I have used my chocolate fountain many times, but this was the first time using Wilton chocolate.  It tasted like artificial chocolate.
5;A very fine coffee full of flavor and aroma.;100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - means a very distinctive aroma and flavor that may not be familiar to many American consumers. This coffee brews up a nice medium roast with exotic floral and berry notes.
5;Amazon's Subscribe & Save program makes this a sweet deal;My wife likes to start her day with a taste of chocolate, so when Amazon's Subscribe & Save program began offering Chocolate Cheerios at a competitive price we placed an order. The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.
5;Extraordinary!!!;I love this jam because of it's unique flavor. Unlike many pear jams (which may be good, but different), this one has the distinctive flavor and aroma of Pear Williams liqueur.
5;Very good product;I am new to making nut milk. It was very easy and quick the bag is easy to clean and works great.
5;YUMMMMM!!!!;We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.
5;BS;Fun change of pace, especially nice for an afternoon cup. Smells wonderful and soft, subtle blueberry flavor.
3;Mediocre in all aspects;Little Debbie Honey Buns attempt to pass themselves off as a tasty snack, but unfortunately, they fail. Their size really does provide you with the perfect amount of pastry, but the taste is so bland that it doesn't really matter.
5;City Ham - the best;I love the City Ham! Burger's Smokehouse has amazing products. The customer service people are extremely helpful.
5;Cereal;This cereal is the best of the bunch of grain cereals of those I've tried, so I buy a lot of it.  It's not at all unusual for me to eat this cereal three times a day, along with other nutritious food.
5;My dog LOVES it;I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can.
5;unusual chocolate treat;i tried bahlsen chocolates in europe, but you can't find them very often in the states. these are unlike any usa chocolates i've eaten, the wafer is wrapped over itself 4-5 times.
5;Super Fresh!!;These are great cookies.  The shipment from Amazon was really, really fresh!  Fresher than cookies from the supermarket.
5;Best brown rice I've ever had;You just have to try this rice. It's the most tastful brown rice I've ever had.
4;Nice flavor for a change of pace;This flavor really needs a bit of sugar added to bring out the real buttery-toffee sensation
3;Very confused about this;I was very puzzled when I saw the weight of this item as I've never seen anything larger than 5 lb bags offered, even when ordering direct from King Arthur Flour Co.<br /><br />I contacted this seller to inquire about the actual weight of the item.
5;great product;This stuff is awesome.  Really.
3;Good, just good;The package arrive with the seals broken, but in a plastic sealed bag, so kinda strange..
2;Drinks were chalky at bottom;These drinks have a chalky residue in bottom of carton as if was spoiled. The drinks received before this shipment was okay.
1;SHAME on YOU;"As I read more labels I am finding out that the FDA is not on the consumer side. ""If it tastes like ""apricot,"" it can legally be called ""apricot."
5;greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst;I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service.
5;My husband loves it!;I bought this for my husband because he wanted a breakfast blend and isn't too fond of the Newmans. He likes the Dunkin Donuts but it's pricey.
4;Cytomax;This is a great product.  I particularly like the Tangy Orange but may try the other flavors later.
4;How to make this mix better;This mix was ok -- for gluten free.  Which means is still was a bit dense and dry.
5;Delicious honey...;The taste of this is so sweet and delicious. I use this in my coffee among other things, especially plain.
2;Better off making your own;It's not bad, almost even good though not as garlicky or peppery as it should be, but that's a weak statement for a tiny jar that costs $11..
5;Fun with Bonsai;When trying to find a descent Bonsai that was relatively inexpensive, I happened upon this little kit. When it arrived the plant was in great shape and nothing was broken or missing.
4;Great taste the whole family loves;Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.
5;Simpli Gluten Free Raspberry Instant Oatmeal;Great taste - even the grand kids like it. Great taste, sums it up, plus it being gluten-free, wheat free and dairy free.
1;all Crushed, don't buy;this is the third popchips box i ordered on Amazon. The box in the box was crushed by a toaster, the chips are really no more fun to eat.
2;Tastes like evaporated milk, showed up leaking;As for the taste of the product, it tastes just like evaporated whole milk to me.  It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.

3;Too sweet frosting mix;
5;Healthy and Balanced;My cat is a little overweight so I switched her from kibble to this food.<br />She's doing better, and between portion control and this grain-free diet<br />she seems happier overall.
5;fantastic and half the price as in the store;my puppy loves this treat.  we actually quarter them and a bag this size lasts a very long time.
5;Good product;Just received two cases.<br /><br />There were 4 dented cans.
5;Very Good;This beef jerky is absolutely delicious. It IS a little pricey, but amazon carries it for 30% less than what stores sell it for here.
5;Superhero Pigtail;Decaf . .
2;Bitter Grass Clippings;I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.
5;Beautiful Orchids!;These flowers arrived after 3 days of heat that was over 100 degrees in July.  I didn't expect them to look like much.
5;Great strong flavor;"I agree with the company motto ""A Natural Obsession"".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent."
5;Ridiculously GOOD;Yes, this stuff is expensive -- but I indulge in the splurge when the taste is so heavenly.  I love almond butter in general, but I have never tasted anything quite like this.
5;Organic is the way to go.;-I'm editing my review because due to travel, I've been forced to buy various brands of regular black beans at the grocery store.  These Natural Value beans are 1000 times better than regular canned black beans you buy at the store.
5;The benefits of K-Cups without the cost and waste.;I tried the highly-rated Ekobrew cup, but must be doing something terribly wrong, as I've yet to get a decent cup of coffee from it - - and, oddly, it delivers only about half the coffee of a regular K-Cup(?!) So I got the My-Kaps and have been thoroughly happy with them. My burr-grinder is set to grind just enough beans to fill the K-Cup, a My-Kap fits snugly into the cup, and I get absolutely no leaking, clogging, or grinds in the cup - - none of the things some people are complaining about.
5;Great for older dogs;My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel. She became 'hooked' on them rather quickly and starts howling for them around 7:00pm daily.
4;Tastes good, xylitol for prevention of cavities;"I have taken a quote off of Wikipedia pertaining to xylitol for dental health:<br /><br />""Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1."
5;Green Mountain;Excellent FULL body, not bitter.  Green mountain makes coffee taste as good as it smells.
5;Don't knock the product!  Think about your dog..;Any dog, no matter their age or size, should be supervised when chewing any edible toy.  Whether it be a rawhide, cow ear, meaty femur or even a stuffed KONG toy.
5;Wonderful flavor, reasonable price;Not too much to say about something like this, I guess. It has a wonderful flavor and is reasonably priced.
5;Great Organic Fair Trade Vanilla;Amazon offers a good price for this vanilla.  If you find you bake a lot you will be pleased with the quanity.
5;Aromatic!;8 oz. is a big package.
5;Excellent;If you are going to eat this kind of stuff, then you might as well do it right. THIS is the only brand I buy for my cold pressed, extra virgin coconut oil.
5;Super fresh!;No one likes stale Nerds! I ordered these hoping it they wouldn't be, and they..
5;Excellent Product;My father drank Postum for 50 years or more and when they removed it from the market, he was very upset.  We immediately began a search of other similar products and finally settled on Pero.
5;Healthy and delicious;This stuff is just outstanding. I highly recommend it, it is filling, healthy and an excellent combination of flavors and textures.
2;Dog didn't like the taste;Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix.
1;Instead purchase Rescue...;I tried this flytrap because my store was out of the Rescue brand (Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant).  This Victor has not caught one fly in four days, while my existing Rescue trap has and is catching 50+ flies per day.
1;Been reported to Amazon.  Buyer beware.;Never received the salsa and the vendor never responded to my email.  Amazon reimbursed me thanks to their A thru Z guarantee.
1;Contains gluten.  AVOID if you are a celiac;This cereal is made in the same facility as wheat containing raisin bran. The amount of gluten in it appears to be low, but it was enough to cause a family member to miss 40 hours of work over a several week period!<br />What really makes me angry about this cereal is that the info on the box makes it seem that Erewhon is a small family owned company dedicated to healthy products.
4;What I do not like is;What I do not like is that amazon.com changes the price on subscribe and save item without noticing.
5;Really, really, really YUMMY!;I bought this candy as an early Valentine's/Birthday present for my husband.  I realized when it arrived that 2lbs? Yeah, that's a LOT of marzipan.
3;Just allright....;These bars are smaller then the usual health bar, taste was allright nothing special was hoping for better flavour.<br />Will not buy again.
5;Real Deal;I am a repeat customer for this product.  I have three dogs and they all go crazy for this treat.
5;great flavor;I use the hazelnut flavor to make  my own coffee syrup.  It smells great and tastes great.
5;great gum;Good long lasting flavorful gum at a great price.Hard to find in my neck of the woods(Long Island).
5;Royal Oak Peanuts, blue tin;I absolutely love these peanuts.  I wrote a previous review for Williamsburg Virgina peanuts which are in the tan colored tin but I enjoy these much more.
4;Works great for some cats;These worked great to hide pills for my cat until he discovered the pill..
1;Ick;I had high hopes for this - I added it to seltzer water and it tastes every so slightly like root beer..
5;Best Pure treat for the USA;My Yorkie is a picky eater.  A friend tried to get her to eat many different treat type products and this is the ONLY one she liked.
5;Delicious! If only I could get it in the UK...;I love this oatmeal, I especially like the flavour, which you can't get in the UK, unless you make up your own..
3;Quanty????;This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info.
5;Yummy!;I don't need to say much more, these are good. Not really hot like you might assume given that it's jalapeno flavor.
5;great product;I have a golden retriever that had severe allergies. He had ear infections several times and a recent skin infection.
5;love this baby food;My son loved this baby food!  Too bad he no longer eats the baby food.  now he eats everything we eat.
5;Perfect treat Puzzle for Active dog!;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:04 Mins<br /><br /></span>Bella my two year old weimaraner really love this toy! everytime i take it out she wags her little tail like crazy. its simple and keeps her busy for the time."
5;Delicious And Healthful Almonds;I eat almonds regularly because of the health benefits. I have<br />not enjoyed eating raw, unflavored and unsalted almonds but have eaten them anyway.
4;weirdest (good) candy I've ever eaten;This candy is a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy.  If you like tamarind flavor, you'll love this.
5;Easy filling breakfast or snack food;My whole family loves these straight out of the box or toasted and the kids even take them to grandma's when we travel.<br />My kids eat them at the bus stop during the school year or have them for a snack after school.
4;Good green tea;I like the taste of Bigelow decaf green tea and Amazon has a great deal on it if you use their Subscribe & Save program.  You can't go wrong with this tea.
5;Tastes good, works well;"I tried this after reading the ingredients which include sweet agave, and an anti-oxidant extracted from ""Porphyra yezoensis Ueda"", a type of seaweed commonly made into seaweed crackers or ""nori"", and l-carnitine.<br /><br />The effect was noticeable and with a quick onset, but without the increased blood pressure normally associated with stronger energy drinks."
4;Big gumdrops;They're fresh but larger then I was expecting.  They are very tasty.
5;Excellent!;Great taste, excellent price.  What more can you ask for?  Highly recommended for a quick, easy, and tasty meal.
4;U Kashi cereal;Liked it somewhat but a little bland, would have liked more walnuts and fruits.  We did like the non-sweetness which I always look for in cereal and other.
1;No miracle, they are NOT edible!;I tried these noodles while doing the HCG diet.  I found that I could not chew them and the only way I could eat them was to swallow them whole.
5;Best Cereal Ever ...;I have been a huge fan of Kashi Go Lean Cereal - Excellent blend of low sugar, multiple grains, high fiber and high protein content. I am also impressed with Amazon's quality delivery service.
2;Great Aroma;
2;Disappointed;I love Taco Bell's grocery items, so I was excited to try this new rice. Unfortunately, it was disappointing.
5;Classic Cookies;All of the flavors I've tried are great
5;Awesome!;I don't eat cereal very often, but I love peanut butter. I noticed these only had 9 grams of sugar (per serving) so I bought some to try.
5;Poppin' Good Northern Popcorn!;I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot.
5;Good stuff!;I love the Peanut Butter Cookie and Cashew Cookie Larabars. This one is a little higher in calories but changes it up a bit with some Chocolate.
1;Maybe it's just me . . .;but I drink dark roasts all the time, and I thought this one was extremely bitter and acidic.  Bad batch, maybe, but I wouldn't buy it again.
5;Puppy loves these!;Thanks to the diet I give her, my pup is very healthy, energetic, and beautiful.  I typically alternate between these and Greenies, and give her either one on a daily basis.
1;BAD, do NOT buy!;"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U."
4;Ekobrew Washer Hack;When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use.
5;I love, love, LOVE it!;I am glad that I chose this production as my introduction to coconut oil.  I love it.
3;Not strong enough..;If you are new to Thai tea, this is for you..
5;I love This Cat Food!;I was so happy to find this food on Amazon.com.
1;Good oil, bad bottle xap;The oils were pretty good, however, i cut my finger trying to break the seal on the terrible screw on cap..
5;My twins love it!;My twins recently got a little picky on the baby food..
4;Not the same as Hot Cinnamon Sunset, but still good;This is a great tea, and if you have never had their Hot Cinnamon Sunset you will be none the wiser that it could be even better.  I fell for the price difference and decided to give it a try.
5;addictive taste;The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.
2;Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me;I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box.
4;Good if you're limited on time;I baked a few pork steaks bone in and the batter came out golden and crispy. The meat was cooked thoroughly and tender.
4;Keep poppin!;This is really good. Tender, a little sweet.
5;Expensive,but it is what it is;"I wasn't crazy about spending almost $35 on this snack,but I'm crazy for all snacks with the ""Flamin Hot"" label.You can't cop them around the way though."
5;Fantastic!!;I love this!!  I use coconut oil as moisturizer for my skin and hair.  I don't suffer from dry skin anymore.
3;Tasty and Healthy;This flavor wasn't too shabby. I've had the black cherry before, and it wasn't bad.
4;A Very Tasty Treat;Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars-Dark Chocolate<br /><br />110 calories--Calories from Fat 25<br />Sodium is only 4% of daily values<br />17g carbs<br />4g protein<br /><br />This was a very tasty snack.  The chewy part is accurate which makes it easier to eat in the car.
4;Good Bar With a Few Kinks;"I found the Kellogg's Kashi Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar, Banana to be tasty and filling in exactly the way you'd expect from a Kashi breakfast bar, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the choices made when developing this item could use a re-think. While the overall flavor is good, the bar does have an odd flavor that does resemble ""burnt""."
3;Not the miracle I anticipated;Sambazon Acai Powerscoop Powder 90g from Sambazon<br /><br />As a person with an auto-immune disease, where chronic fatigue is a major obstacle, I have navigated through many nutritional support options to supplement a healthy diet and when I first began to read about the Acai Berry, I was interested in trying it. I have used other anti-oxidant products from very dependable sources, and there is just no dramatic difference I detect with this product.
4;Soothing to the stomach...;Loved it!!! I use half of the sachet in a cup of hot water (kinda strong for my taste). I put a few drops of honey and it's perfect drink after  full meal,it helps digesting food and very soothing to the stomach.
5;Just what I was looking for;Jennifer's review was spot on, I love this French Vanilla cappuccino! This is exactly what I was looking for, yes it's not your Starbucks cappuccino, it's more like what you get at mini-marts or service stations. I'm not a hard coffee drinker and this is just what I was looking for, Thank You, Jennifer.
5;Delicious;These liquorice flavored Altoids are so hard to find in retail stores. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon, and will reorder as soon as we get close to the end of the large supply we purchased.
3;disappointed;I was looking forward to a good old fashioned plate of bangers and mash, and thought this would be a real treat for my family. They were dry and tasteless, edible, but needed a bit of fat and some spice.
5;Sees candy is always great;I really enjoy sending things online. This purchase was a gift so I really think that there should have been available a gift card to send with it.
5;Love it;Bubble Yum was, and will remain the purest form of Bubble Gum.  In an age where bizarre flavoring seems to be the only way to market, this venerable label manages pure bubble gum flavor and best of all texture.
1;DANGEROUS!!;DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one.
4;Didnt like the grape taste but very fun to make;I got it in the mail today,it took a week to get here. Very pleased about the shipping.
5;Salt & Pepper Popchips are the BEST!!!;I love this product. I like some of the other flavors, but this one is the very best.
1;Awful;This product did not work at all. It made even more of a mess than just taking a spoon and mixing up the peanut butter.
5;Great balanced bar;These are an ideal bar for on the go! Though I would not order them again during the hot season here in Southern California. They arrived melted.
5;Quality Creamer;This is a bulk case of the same creamer you'd purchase at the store.  Excellent, fresh tasting creamer delivered to your door and at a fraction of what other office supply companies charge.
5;Good tea;"Beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or ""bite"".  Recommended without hesitation."
5;Love at first bite!;My 17-year-old cat Toonces is VERY finicky, so I wasn't sure how she'd like these chicken-flavored treats.  I tried four in the palm of my hand and she ate them without batting a whisker.
5;Crawfish;Fast shipping! Loved the product! I made crawfish etouffe and it was a big hit.  Thank you again for offering this product online.
1;Bad.....very, very bad;Nasty aftertaste.  Bought two bottles thinking it sounded good since I love pumpkin flavored foods and drinks.
5;Jacks Links Premium Teriyaki Jerky;I have bought many 3.5 ounce packages of the Teriyaki Jerky from Jacks Links and have always found it to be fresh, tasty and a great treat.
2;DRY NEEDS MORE BUTTER;Ok,lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn,but in my local grocery store I can buy Market Pantry popcorn for $ 4.25 for 18 large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy,and I went through 2 boxes in less than a month,but then we have this one Pop Secret and my first 3 bags BURNT  and was not happy so I decided not to follow the instructions,so I decided to put microwave at 3 minutes and let it stop when it got to 20 sec's,ok so it didn't burnt it,but due to me not placing it microwave on high,it took a very long time to cook it,and so anyway's it began to pop,and so I thought great,at least no burnt popcorn,and I was so excited and HUNGRY to try it,due to the ratings on this site,I began to eat it,and my first reaction was,oh my good ness,DRY DRY ,where is the butter ?.
4;Great gift for a hunter.;My son in law is an avid hunter I sent him the Deer Hunters Gift Basket for the holidays. He has raved about it.
5;This is the best!!!!;Just like Spain if you follow it right. I love this package.
5;Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food;When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.
5;Dolce Gusto Mocha Review;One of the excellent varieties of coffees offered by this brand.  The texture and taste is very different and yet very good.
5;Community Coffee;Great Coffee, and thanks Amazon for making it possible to order through you. We have been drinking this coffee all of our lives and will continue to do so.
4;Eureka;I have been looking for a genuine source of true maracuja flavor to make juice and to make an Indian drink called a lassi.  I was so thrilled to find this product and the lassi was incredible.
5;Yummy!;Bought three different Kind bars from Amazon at the same time. This was the only one that arrived perfectly.
4;"Help pup ""wise up""!";"Great little toy for you an your pup to play with together. You'll be surprised how easily they get the hang of it, no matter how clueless they are at first! We play ""treat wheel"" about once a week so she doesn't get it too fast."
5;favorite chai;This is my favorite chai flavor of all the different brands I've tried.  It doesn't really taste like coconut, but.
5;Yummy Surprise;I recieved my first care package from my mother the other day and in it were these Emerald Chocolate Cherry flavored trail mix, packets. Such a surprise! And a delicious one at that.
5;Great seasoning!;I love this seasoning. I used to use the adobo from Goya but Badia is even better tasting and less sodium.
5;organic dog food;Human-grade chicken, all organic dog food.  The food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the Subscribe & Save program.
5;Lifesaver for Deployed Spouse;My husband doesn't drink coffee or any other energy drinks so when he was deployed I had a hard time finding an affordable way to ship cases of red bull to him.  This was the perfect solution and arrived in the same amount of time as if I'd sent it from home.
2;Rihanna, stick to music;I love vita coco water.  Having said that, this is the worst of the flavors, in my opinion.
5;The Best Old-Fashioned Coffee Shop Cup of Coffee!;.<br /><br />Donut House blend is my favorite K-cup.
4;great biscoff cookie jar;This is a great cookie but the container needs to be more sturdy.  Top of container was crooked and flimsy.
1;didn't work on windows 7;this does not work on windows 7, tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din't work. This was a waste of time and money.
5;Best bagged tea there is!;I'm a tea snob and typically buy the more expensive whole leaf teas by the ounce, but when traveling, I typically take bagged tea for convenience. I've tried all the usual brands you typically find at your local grocery store and they're all just terrible.
5;Great for cooking and baths;Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt.
5;Hot Coco;Wonderful hot  chocolat, Very cream. I will recommand this product to all.
4;Good once you get used to it...;I couldn't get over the initial thought that these had the consistency and texture of dog food. Yep, that's right! But after I got over that, it tasted good.
5;just wonderful from amazon;love this popcorn & have lbs. in stock as I never want to run out of this product.
5;My dogs are finicky but they love thses treats;My dogs are the pickiest dogs I have ever seen.  Most dogs will eat any treat, but my dogs won't and when I discovered the Chicken Nibbles they love them so much and can't get enough of them.
5;Wow -- Shocked at the Negative Reviews;I picked this up at Target last week only because I had a coupon. I was genuinely surprised:  it's some of the best coffee I've ever made at home.
5;Mostly Raw foods... All delicious!;I love these bars. They are primarily seed based, so if you don't love seeds then you won't love these bars.
4;Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! 15 oz. cereal;Crunchy indeed! Careful when chewing,there may be the occasional hard chunk. The taste is sweet with a little taste of cinnamon.
4;Easy and love all the nutrients;I'm a vegetarian mom with carnivorous kids. This is a nice way to be able to give them what they want without me having to actually cook it myself! It's surprising how fresh it all looks inside the box.
4;There isn't to much I can say . . .;So far STonewall's Jerquee is the best of this sort of item I've found.  I always have it on hand.
1;Gummy, can't be used with just any GF recipe;I have gone through 5 lbs of this flour, trying everything possible to change the consistency that it comes out as..
4;Perfect Cold Weather Drink For Coffee Lovers;I have to be honest.  I am hopelessly addicted to pumpkin!  I have loved pumpkin from the time I was a little girl and I still love it so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try this product.
1;Poor product;These packets are all oily and the product inside is all seperated and gross. In addition they add a ton of sugar.
4;Great for lunch boxes;My kids love this milk.  I love it because it doesn't have to be refrigerated until the night before it goes in the lunch box, so it's not taking up space.
3;Bitter aftertaste;I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.
3;Eh....;This was *ok*.  It tasted basically like burnt Parmesan cheese.
1;Instant vomiting;I normally give my cats the occasional treat of tuna from Solid Gold, which has always worked great.<br />It has some dark tuna mush and also some nice bites of clearer, solid fish.
1;HORRIBLE!!! - Like Sawdust with chocolate flavor;These are some of the worst tasting cookies I've ever had. I'm amazed people can give this anything above one star, let alone 5 STARS?!?!<br />HUH???<br />It makes me think they've never had a real cookie before, ever.
5;Fantastic Iced Tea;Let me start by saying that this is an absolutely fantastic iced tea.  Full of flavor and antioxidants!  Give it a try - only 80 Calories for the entire can!  (40 cals/serving).
5;Great Flavor;Did some comparison taste testing and this came out on top.  Organic and great flavor without the caffeine.
5;yummy!;Where I live you can only get these in a big bag of mixed tootsie products around Halloween time--and there are only about ten in the bag--I was hooked after eating those ten! lol..
1;It's not pure kombucha;No wonder this stuff tastes so good- look at the ingredients! It's not pure Kombucha
5;Yum! Yum!;I have not been able to find ribbon candy in the stores for a while now.  After seeing this being made on a TV show I ordered it immediately and it arrived at my daughters in 3 days in time for Christmas.
4;Gluten free - Munch worthy & Crunchy with a hint of sweetness & salt..Popchips Sweet Potato;I'm all for healthier, crunchy snacks. Popchips works for me in this category.
4;Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others;My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters.
5;Potent!;This stuff is good. Forget the usual store-bought cayenne, this is in a league of its own.
5;A Cup of Heaven - Caramel Macchaito;This is by far one of my most favorite flavors of non-dairy creamers that International Delight has available. Makes EVERY cup of coffee delightful.
5;The only green tea I like;I drink Twinings Orange Pekoe black tea, raspberry leaf tea and this. I can't stand any other teas very much.
3;I'd know more if the cat had liked it;I tried giving this to our 18-year-old cat. He's about as picky as a cat can be, and he didn't like the vitamins.
5;Love this stuff;First off..
1;It wil not only make your dogs very sick, it may kill them!;I had to give it one star to register my review..
4;Finicky Cat Eats It;My cat is somewhat choosy about her food, and she likes this. There are little meat-ball like pieces in here that she leaves behind if I don't smash them a bit with a fork before serving, but that's not a big deal.
5;Hot Chipotle- these are great!;I researched Chipotle Peppers when we wanted to make a good sauce for New Deli sandwiches. I am not going to pay good money for a can full of cheaper ingredients, when I can get something like these wonderful dried peppers, for considerably less.
5;blaze glaze;This is the best glaze ever! Use on fruit or ice cream vegetables meat or fish.I have to always have some in my pantry.
1;Clarify Quantity please;This must be for a case of 20 which is how they are sold in bulk.  The shipping weight is listed at 3 Lbs so this CANNOT be for each!.
5;restaurant style oatmeal in your home;Our family began a search for this oatmeal after having it served at a lovely, popular hotel.  It was not until later that we all shared the fact that we loved it so much, but by then we were home.
5;best dog food around;I've been giving my dog this food since she was a few months old.  We just recently switched to the adult version.
5;My 3rd favorite flavor;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
3;slightly misnomerd perhaps, but good shelf brand q sauce;im from nc..
5;GREAT TREAT;I ordered two bags..
5;DELICIOUS!;There's only one word to describe this..
5;Mesquite BBQ;These chips are the best!! I've tried some of the other flavors and they are ok, nothing special..
4;Dingo All the way!;My dog loves Dingo bones, we usually buy her the original pack but we decided to try the peanut butter flavor. She loved them, but was giving her potty issues so we had to stop giving them to her.
5;So good;These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar.
5;Busy Bones;These bones are pricey but my German Shepard loves them. Because the bones are so dense and heavy they take a lot longer to devour, hence the name, Busy Bone.
5;Fiji water***great taste;Try it at least one time.  It cost a little more, but it's worth it.
5;Wonderful product and great service!;Product arrived quickly and was well packaged.  Great product at a great price.
4;yummy!;A good drink, about 3 WW points. I mean it's about what you'd expect from an orange soda- expect it's all natural, so you recognize the things on the ingredient label.
1;Be wary using this fence charger around small animals;I bought one of these to use in a small pen to train piglets to electric fence before putting them out to pasture. Since they had never been in an electric fence before I had to put ElectroNet woven fence up to keep them from charging through it the first couple of times they got shocked.
2;Why These Flavors?;Wasn't a fan of three flavors. The lemonade and orange flavors are pretty good, though.
4;Good, solid product - worth eating.  Somewhat spicy.;First this product excels because it isn't loaded with nasty preservatives, chemicals or other nasty junk, just the good stuff.  The meat itself is perfection, I haven't ever found any fat or hard bits, always just the right moisture and texture good quality tender meat.
1;VERY LIGHT!;I mistakenly grabbed this Donut HOUSE blend at Costco thinking it was the Donut SHOP blend of k-cup (by Coffee People).  I realized it wasn't Donut SHOP the first time I made a cup.
2;Flavor not good and container lid was unglued on half of them;Some of the other flavors in this brand of Coconut water's are very good. This one is nasty in my opinion.
5;Fabulous Treats!;I purchased this item in preparation for our first cruise.  Neither of us know whether or not we'll experience motion sickness on the ship.
5;Ribbon Candy;This Ribbon candy is beautiful: very thin, colorful and delicious.  The candy is part of our Christmas tradition, but all the stores sold out early in our town.
4;Easter Gifts;Looked for something other than chocolate and found these organic cookies which were well received by the grandchildren.  Would certainly look at this seller again.
3;Taste better cold. Has been chlorinated.;I would have preferred this be natural spring water but it was processed to come very close to a natural taste. As long as you get to near freezing temps.
5;yum;This is the best orange spice tea I have ever had.  Lots of flavor.
5;Miracle oil;I took the leap in trying coconut oil after reading about using it as a deep conditioning treatment for hair.  I have very curly, coarse hair and combination (though mostly dry) skin.
5;Dr. Zevia;As a diabetic who likes soda, I mostly avoid sugary sodas.  Until a year ago, I drank the usual Aspartame-sweetened diet sodas
4;Jasmine Green Tea.;Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).
5;Hazelnut Goodness;The k-cups were all in one box, great packaging. Gloria Jean's hazelnut was delicious.
5;Too good to be GF;We are new to gluten free cooking and this is on the 4th bread we've tried. I like some of Bob's Red Mill products and others are just ok.
5;Don't listen to the negative reviews!;I don't understand why other reviewers are complaining about the sugar content in this product. GO TO THE WEBSITE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
2;Dog was a fan, but I wasn't;I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping.
3;Hard Gum;The box of cigars is certainly festive and appropriate for a work environment, especially if smoking is frowned on.  The bubblegum cigars are very hard though, more of a keepsake than to actually chew.
5;I love this;this one is my favorite out of most wasabi peas I tried. perfect heat and salty taste.
2;You get what you pay for;It's just not pleasing to eat. Obviously, because it's thin, there's not much chewing action.
5;Better than Starbucks;I was delighted to discover this rich-tasting coffee, which has half the acid of regular brands. I served it to a guest with an acid reflux problem and she not only enjoyed the cuppa, she reported that she felt fine afterwards.
3;Dogs are undecided!;I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.
1;Description says pack of 6--only means only pack of 6!!!;"I have ordered countless things from Amazon that say ""Pack of 6"" in the description.  This time I received one package of applesauce and they told me that since it contains 6 cups that that is the pack of 6."
1;Expensive crumbs...;"I wanted to ""test"" order this item before I bought several and have them shipped as gifts, and good thing I did, because the cookies came in crumbs.  Although the box is a metal box and came un-bumped, 1/3 of the cookies inside were broken to pieces."
1;Worst Fudge Ever;I would not recommend this product.  First it is unreturnable, arrived in a timely manner but the Fudge is rock hard.
5;Delicious, Orvill has the best popcorn!!;I am so glad I bought this popcorn. The whole family loves it.
5;Our Dog Loves These Treats;Our vet told us to switch our dog to a treat that contained ingredients he hadn't had on a regular basis because we're working to determine what is producing an itchy allergic reaction.  So far it looks like he may be allergic to chicken and maybe corn, neither is in this treat.
4;Excellent selection and variety.;I was a little apprehensive reading some of the other companies reviews on the random selections.  It seems that some come with multiple duplicates and bad variety.
2;You should not go... with this mango.;I bought this for someone who loves both mangos and cold brew Iced T.  After trying this out, neither one of us really cared for the taste, as it was pretty bland.
5;tasty jerky!;good tasting jerky for the price. My father in law had never had it before and really enjoyed the flavor.
3;Nice flavor;The drink had a nice flavor and wasn't too sweet. The only thing that I did not like about the drink was that it seemed to make my mouth a little dry.
1;Deceptive description;On Oct 9 I ordered from a different vendor the same product 1.2 oz- 6 pack.
5;More Science Diet on Prime Please;As a frequent Amazon shopper, I purchase nearly everything for my household on Amazon.  I use Amazon Mom & Subscribe and Save almost everyday.
5;Yum;Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
5;The best jerky I've ever tried! So good!;- Excellent cuts of meat with no tendons.<br />- Very tasty.
5;Great value!;Buying yeast in bulk is a great value if you frequently make yeast breads and baked goods. This yeast is vacuum packed in a heavy foil package
5;Allergies Begone!;So far, this is one of only 3 dog food brands that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food.
1;Had such great hopes, but......;We have three cats - two wanted nothing to do with it no matter how many times we tried.  Ended up pooping on the carpet, something they have never done before.
5;Very Tasty Topping!;High quality ingredients in this most flavorful Italian topping.  I did not have the problem with the containers that others have mentioned here.
1;Extremely Disappointed;I love spicy food, and I add hot sauce to almost everything I eat, but this hot sauce a completely disappointment.<br /><br />The name itself is b.
5;Best gluten free flour that I have found!;It has worked great for cookies, pancakes, waffles and cake.  Bread or pizza dough.
4;Delicious but smashed;Perfect, just like I remember.  However, every cookie was completely broken in all three packages.
5;I love this so much;I love Wasa crisp bread and this is my favorite kind. It's thick and crunchy with a good rye flavor.
5;Tasty, Lean, and Insanely Addictive;Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.
2;I want tot give this better review;This almond milk tastes great! It has a great flavor that is similar to cow's milk with a nutty flavor. If I think the taste is so great then why don't I give it a better rating? Unfortunately, there is no calcium in this un-enriched version so I can't really use it as a milk substitute for my children.
5;Best;These are the best gluten free crackers I have ever tasted.  It tastes like regular crackers.
5;LOVE THIS COFFEE!;THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE COFFEE SINCE DAY ONE OF HAVING MY KEURIG. YOU CAN'T MESS IT UP.
4;Very fruity flavored herbal tea;Not one of my Stash favorites but it's supposed to be good for you so I bought it.  It's a bit too fruity and sweet for my taste but if that's what you like than this tea is for you.
3;Disappointed.;The tree does not look as good as the one in the picture. It was packed in too small of a box, thus, from the base of the plant to the tip it curves to form a 90 degree angle.
5;Excellent !;This cheese is excellent. I bought it for grating over pasta, but it is very good in salads , with fruit or just eaten by itself.
5;Super Yum!;These were better than I could have ever hoped.  As far as the Weight Watcher plus points goes they are 3 pp.
5;BEST SNACK EVER!;My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  They are so healthy and yet she thinks they are a dessert.
5;Green Mountain French Vanilla Coffee--Yum;Hubby and I both really like this coffee.  The only thing we found wrong with it is that it could use a wee more vanilla.
4;I can finally eat sardines;Everything you read about healthy eating says to eat sardines (low on fish food chain, Omega 3s, sustainable) but I just couldn't get around the heads and bones. Finally heard about these and tried them (one can from my store first) and they're good.
5;LOVE these!;"These are hard to find. Having lived in GB for a few years, they are a ""habit."
5;Agree With Tango;Great price and a really good hot addition to a meal. I like to throw some in with a boneless chicken breast in the oven.
3;TRIED BEFORE GREAT TASTE. BUT.??? WHY.???;SHIPPED IN TWO BOX'S COULD BE PUT IN ONE. JAMMED SIDE WAYS IN THE BOX IT WAS IN SO TIGHT WILL NEED A HAMMER TO GET IT LOOSE LIKE POWDER AGAIN.
5;Bit-O-Honey;This hugh bag of bite size, old fashioned candy was perfect for Halloween Trick or Treaters. The candy is delicious and perfect to drop a few in each child's bag, and no messy chocolate.
4;great gift;I gave these to my husband for Christmas..
5;Excellent bold coffee;We bought the French Roast and Big Easy Bold at the same time. Both are great and we alternate drinking them.
5;A great veggie option.;I have two toddlers who are not always willing to eat fresh vegetables. HappyBaby is a great and tasty way for them to get their veggies and fruits.
4;Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy;First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull.
5;Absolute Best Earl Grey I have ever tried;Wow, so deep, rich and bursting with flavor from the first sip to bottom of the cup. I love that it is Organic and such a great price.
1;The worst !!!;I usually don't leave reviews but I had to voice my opinion. Save your money !! Red Vines doesn't deserve to be called licorice.
5;It warmed me up;I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea..
5;The Best Popcorn!!!!;This is the closest popcorn to theatre popcorn.  I have purchsed many products products that are similar, but the texture and tast of Great Northern are the best that I have ever tried.
4;Well, it works;This stuff tastes horrible. And you have to drink a lot of it to get it to work, but it does work.
1;My cats don't like it and my Vet doesn't recommend it;My cat was sick and not eating well so I bought this on advice of a coworker after my cat had gotten a force feeding and meds from the Vet. She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done.
3;good stuff;I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.
1;come on people ... MADE IN CHINA;Just few words ..
4;Delicious, almost as good as Cafe Britt;I've been buying Costa Rican coffee direct from that country's largest export roaster for over a decade and love their products, especially their Tarrazu, Tres Rios and Poas blends.  But prices have been creeping up faster than other coffees.
4;Pretty Tasty;This makes me think Kool-aid for grownups. It is  that deep red color and pretty sweet tasting.
4;Good all around insecticide, fungicide, and miticide;A bit hard to get from the container into your spray bottle without spilling a bit or getting it on yourself (comes out as a very thick gooey gel), but once it's mixed with water and shaken up a bit it's fine. One thing I noticed is that after applying there is a fine powdery dust leftover on the leaves.
4;Misleading photo but still very tasty!;My kids really enjoy this cereal probably because it so sweet. If you have had Nut & Honey Crunch, it tastes very similar.
5;Delicious Spiced Tea (Chai);Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.
5;excellent cacao nibs;These cacao nibs are in good packaging that protects the quality and<br />even though it is a natural product that could easily contain debris..
5;My Dog's Favorite Treat;I buy the medium treats for my 19 lb Long Hair Chihuahua mix and he loves these! They are pricey but cheaper than what you will find at the store or Pet store. He gets one every other day.
4;Good coffee, terrible name.;This coffee was great. My family loves it a lot.
5;Brown and delicious!!;Really enjoy the taste and quality of this brown rice so far. Much faster to cook this using a pressure cooker.
5;Yum;I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.
1;Gross!!!!;I bought these thinking they would be a great low-calorie alternative to pasta, they were not even a good alternative. I prepared the noodles according to the directions and tossed them with my favorite pasta sauce.
2;Sweet, sugary soda;"Switch Kiwi Berry is a soda made from carbonated water and juice concentrates of Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry, Strawberry and mysterious ""natural flavors"". At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda."
5;These Chips Taste Like The Potato They Came From!;As many have said, it is very difficult to find a chip that isn't loaded with salt and so much grease you need an entire roll of paper towels to clean up with after just a few bites. You can actually taste the potato these chips were cut from and because of the intense potato taste, you don't miss the salt.
3;Contains Vegetables;Ten bags were consumed in eight days. If you are worried about not eating enough vegetables, this product is GOOD.
5;Can't live without it, no other seasoned salt compares;There is absolutely nowhere to find Goya's Adobo (seasoned salt) within an hour of where I live, and I grew up with it so what a relief to buy it in bulk and know I don't have to go on an expedition to hunt it down. Like our Supreme Court Justice nominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, I'm a Nuyorican, and yep, we're nuts for our special food, prepped just the way Mom did.
5;Amazing Gift;I recieved this bear yesterday. And it is truly amazing how big it is.
5;Great Yeast;I bought this yeast to use in my breadmaker.  It gives a beautiful rise to my breads both in and out of my breadmaker.
3;Poorly packed;The tea was smushed into the box so badly that a couple of the individual wrappers were damaged and bust open. The box itself had a hole in it.
5;pretty good for decaf;I am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups I have tried but this one is probably the best.I like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what I would expect although it says medium roast.
4;Good Corn, Bad Shipping/Packaging;The pack came in a large box and it looked like it had been dropped like a dozen times..
1;Vile!;My work takes me on the road often, and here I am stuck again with a Tassimo in my host's house. I thought I'd contribute by buying some pods.
4;good crunch, a bit sweet;These have a denser oatmeal flavor than most granola bars - in a good way.  The first bite makes it seem that they are not sweet enough but then that is followed up with an almost too sweet after-flavor.
2;Havahart Critter Ridder 3143 Animal Repellent Concentrate 8-Ounces;Sprayed Animal Repellant with a slightly heavier concentration than instructions indicated. Although noxious to human scent, doesn't seem to work on whatever is attacking my tomatoes.
5;Great taste, better than Starbuck's beans!;We have recently switched to decaf and were buying Starbucks' decaf espresso beans.  They were good but prettyexpensive and weren't organic.
5;Great nutritious snack!;My son loves these puffs..
4;Tasty, but not really granola;This stuff is addictive.  Everyone in my family who's tried it loves it, especially the whole dried fruits and nuts-- it's almost more like trail mix than granola.
5;Peace, Love and Ginger Snaps!;Crispy, chewy and intensely flavorful -- WOW, they are just great. I've loved ginger snaps since.
3;Fairly Decent Flavor;I don't taste the artificial sweetener the others have mentioned. Maybe it's because I use it.
5;Great alternative snack;I tried a few different flavors of these and did not like them.  I was eating think thin crunch mixed nut bars until the recent recall.
1;Gross.  Too sweet, too slimy!;I bought this soup this evening thinking it was a good product, 100% natural ingredients, etc  When I opened the can, I found it like dark pink slime, and it oozed out of the can into the pot.  It's super sweet, too.
1;Oh This Is Awful Stuff;I must have gotten hold of a bad batch.  The other two reviewers loved it.
5;Yummy;These cookies taste as good as they look. The packaging is very pretty and sets the stage, so to speak, for the tasting experience to come.
5;Much better than rice or pasta;This is a must for dieters to get the feeling of satiety with no extra calories or carbs.  I think Miracle is a good description.
5;Delicious;For some reason the stores in our area no longer carry this delicious candy.  I was thrilled to find it on amazon.
5;Delicious!;These cubes are absolutely delicious with any dish.  I have used them as a soup base, on fish, crumbled them in breadings, ribs and even roasts.
5;Too damn tasty!;Good to see that someone hasn't changed the recipe too much from childhood years of 30+ years ago..
2;I'd rather drink water;Don't waste your money on lemonade that tastes like waste water. That's a bit of an exaggeration.
5;Sweet and Salty;I love bacon and chocolate. This is the perfect combination!!! Don't let the poor reviews deter you.
5;great cappuccino;i tried this coffee when it was $ll for 24 k cups delicious. so i bought two more boxes and didn't sign up for monthly delivery, now i can't find where to sign up.
4;Satisfies a sweet potato tooth;Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.
5;Tasty Sugar Free Flavoring - Highly Recommended!;Torani Sugar Free Raspberry Syrup is a great tasting, diabetic friendly flavoring. This syrup has a subtle and natural raspberry flavor that goes great in ice tea or mixed with club soda.
5;Great Lollipops;The best tasting lollipops, the fact they are organic is a huge plus. Our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill.
1;Gone down hill;When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame.
5;Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee;This is my absolute favorite coffee of all! I have other K-Cups in the carousel and on the kitchen shelf, but they are being totally ignored until I run out of this flavor.  I have recommended it to others, and they all agree that it is delicious.
5;Best Tea Ever;I tried this tea in a sampler pack and became totally addicted!  I moved and could not find any stores that carry the flavor so I have to buy online.<br /><br />It is a very sweet and strong tea that requires no sugar or milk.
5;Deliciously Sour and Soft;This candy is one of my favorites.  Nice and soft, easy to chew, and has the right about of sourness.
5;Another Great Judy's Creation;This is my third Judy's candy and I've not been disappointed. Again, I can't believe it's low carb (1/2 a net carb per piece).
4;High Protein, Low Fat, Tast Great. Expensive.;I was skeptical but this product is all its cracked up to be. Tastes great and works well in use.
5;These are great!;This is my first time trying flavored grits. I am so used to the original my mom grew us up on.
5;The BEST tasting fruit preserve you will ever have!;I tried St. Dalfour All Natural Fruit Spread at a bread and breakfast and was just blown away at how delish it was! I was so impressed that I found our hostess and commented on how much I enjoyed the scones and fruit spread.
2;Too strong and too reminiscent of green tea (not chamomile);I love chamomile tea and I like green tea..
5;W00, my first review other than Games & Music!;While I agree with the other reviewers such as Van Halen Fan & Pete, I disagree with 1 part. Honestly, Pepsi DOES have more sweetness as well as tasting a bit more bland than Coke, but other than that, I don't see THAT much more difference than the seperate tastes in the Regular kinds.
5;Great product, great cup of coffee, everytime!;I first used the Keurig machine at work and quickly became hooked.  When leaving my last job I was given a home brewer as a parting gift by my co-workers.
5;The best yet;This coffee is delightful the absolute bee's knees, real deal. I'm happy I found this turkish style coffee on Amazon, no more trips to the Greek store for coffee.
5;Great way to jack up flavor without additional salt;I like these because not only are they clearly vegan, but also no salt has been added (I think there's a minimal amount of natural sodium in there.) So it doesn't make foods more salty just more flavorful.
5;Good product!;These dried cherries, along with the blueberries from this same company, are soft and a nice texture and flavor. They are not the typical tough, dry, chewy, dried fruit you normally get from other places.
5;Liv-r licious!;My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats.
5;love this pasta;My husband and I love good pasta. This was great tasting for a try pasta.
4;Smoklehouse Chicken Chips;Very good product, although the added ingredients make it very bad for allergic dogs. A listing of all ingredients on the web site would be very helpful when purchasing.
5;Best airsoft sniper rifle ever.;Whilst googling for a good airsoft bolt action sniper rifle, I stumbled across this beauty.<br /><br />Gets amazing FPS, over 1000 easily.
2;70% of the chips in the bag are over cooked;I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly.
5;Rich, Delicious Snack Bars;These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich.
5;Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality;I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition.
4;Potent;This is good stuff.  I usually can drink tea without any flavoring or sweetener, but this stuff is strong and almost bitter to me.
1;It stunk and tasted just as bad;I purchased this from my local market and boy, am I sorry to have done that.  This particular Starbuck's blend is awful to say the least.
5;Amazingly delicious  and fresh tasting!;Even just on its own these crushed hemp seeds are phenomenal. I can understand how a 3# package can last quite a long time although I do use it to make milk in my soymilk maker http://www.
5;so. much. frosted flakes.;Half way through box 3, I got so sick of it. These boxes are huge! One of the boxes came slightly damaged, but otherwise it was as expected.
4;"My kids say ""Thumb's Up"" . . .";. .
3;Tastes horrible but I think it helped.;I was told to use this product for tight muscles.  It seemed to help with that.
1;Didn't like it, Wrong one;"I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said ""Dark Chocolate"" so I ordered it."
1;Bummer;This product was supposed to increase energy with the possible side effect of weight loss.  Neither happened.
5;Great Chip;I purchased these sweet potato chips at Costco.  When they stopped carrying them I was going through withdrawal until finding them on-line.
1;yuck;this stuff is nasty, waste of money. it has a weird geewy taste to it and just plain nasty.
4;chrysanthemum tea;The Chrysanthemu Tea reched me well, unfortunaltely have two packages been openend and reclosed. The tea otself is very well, of good flavour and well dried.
5;Tasty Treat;These are tasty.  Great Strawberry flavor.
5;Delicious, beautiful, and more economic than it sounds.;I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.
2;Great coffee, but this offer is overpriced;This is my favorite K-Cup and the only one I buy. But I can get a box of 18 K-cups for $9.
5;Very tasty and healthy snack!  Addicting!;Sahale snacks are awesome! It amazes me how this company comes up with so many mouth watering flavors, especially this one. The combination of pomegranate, vanilla, and cashews is fantastic.
5;So Delicious;"These are the best ""gummi"" bears I have ever had.  They are so delicious and flavorful."
2;Good, but not great;I am a tea lover, particularly herbal teas, and the blackberry taste in this one is good. I could probably get used to the vanilla, but I'd rather drink something else.
1;Weak imitation of a great product;Arizona Iced Tea products are terrific - except the powder substitute.  This product while purported to be Arizona Arnold Palmer Half and Half has 0 likeness to the canned and bottled products.
4;Great Medium Roast Coffee for your Keurig;Great Medium Roast Coffee, very similar to a lot of the Columbian Style K-Cups<br /><br />Pro's<br />Smooth pleasent aftertaste, not that bitter after taste you get from some of the Jet Fuels that pose as bold coffee.<br />Great start your morning coffee if you enjoy the medium blends.
5;We love this stuff;We love to  use the cheese topping in macaroni-and-cheese, and can't easily get the product here in the Pacific Northwest. It's nice not to have to go to Florida anymore to buy it.
5;Awesome!;You don't find many strawberry flavored hard candies, and these are great!  The only problem is having enough of them to keep everyone in the family happy..
5;No mess!;This is one of the greatest things I have ever given my dog. He is a puppy, so it's taking him a long time to even show that he has been chewing on the antler.
5;Lipton Loose Tea;This is a great product and the only problem we have is the unreliability of finding it on the Grocery Store shelf. With Amazon.
5;Everyday caffeine addict;So, basically my morning routine is, wake up, go to work, buy an orange flavor Rockstar, and work
5;delicious;add to a pasta dish or cut into strips for pizza topping - these add a wonderful flavor. Hard to describe but not hot, just delicate and different.
5;Great Treat;My dog loved this treat. If you want to pay the price for an all-natural product, I'm sure your dog will love it too.
5;Good Cobbler;I am a Bisquick biscuit lover from way back, and I thought the biscuits made per the recipe were a little blah, but I think they would be perfect using butter or margarine in place of shortening, so I have hope. As far as the cobbler goes, I made a triple berry using the shortcake recipe on the back (which calls for butter rather than shortening) as the crust.
5;good chapati;I loved these chapati.  They were very very fresh and good.
5;Quick snack on a road march.;My Husband and his fellow soldiers love that I send snacks like the Slim-Jims because they are always appreciative of a quick, easy snack during their training exercises and on road marches. I prefer to buy in bulk, so that I know they are stocked, even temporarily.
5;Best Treats for Your Dog;These are the best treats for your dog.  I have a very finicky Shih Tzu who thinks she is the Queen of England and is very fussy about food.
3;Smooth, rich and keeps me going.;As like the others have already said, a very delicious, rich, strong coffee that will keep you going all day. It is very good by itself, or with milk, or my personal favorite, some chocolate coffee creamer.
5;Love the gold!;I must admit I was totally and completely addicted to honey before these came along. Now it's even worse.
5;Dogswell veggie life happy hips chicken & sweet potato;My dog Mona just loves her Happy Hips chicken & sweet potato treats. They are not only delicious or so it seems, but they seem to ease the stiffness in her hips.
1;bronchipret;Bronchipret made &#8203
4;Good, but could be better;Same as the Peruvian dark roast.  We enjoyed the coffee but prefer the Sumatra dark roast which seems to be more flavorful to our taste.
5;Great first food;My baby loves this. It's a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids.
5;Very tasty, great price;My husband and I use this sauce all the time. It tastes great, is versatile in recipes, and is an excellent price.
3;If you like cloves...;First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.
5;Earthy and comforting;Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy.
5;DELICIOUS;***** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SUNMAID HONEY RAISIN BRAN MUFFINS NOT Krusteaz.  It appears that Amazon has switched products.
5;Best Decaf Ever;This has to be the best decaf I've ever brewed at home.<br />I was a little scared of the darkness of the roast, but the flavor is incredible.
5;smooth;This went down very smooth with no burn. On par with Patrone in my book.
5;Both my dog and cat liked this;My dog will eat anything, but my cat is really picky. Up until now, the only treat he would even look at was bonito flakes.
1;Weak Coffee;Bought this coffee to take on vacation to use in the little 4-cup pots that are always in hotel rooms.  My husband, the coffee drinker, said it was very weak (even using two packs at one time).
5;3 plants from one pot;I actually got this item as a gift and it's worked out great. I watered my can during the winter and kept it on south facing windowsill for a few months.
5;Subscribe and Save;Happy with the product, the shipping, and the price. Tastes great in my cereal to go! Regular soy milk can go bad waiting in my lunch box.
5;Best Pancake/Waffle Mix;This product was very highly rated by most reviewers so I purchased it along with the Villaware Belgian Waffle Maker.  This is the best tasting pancake/waffle mix I have ever tried.
3;How do you use these?;"I've been reading amazing things about Cacao, health benefits, etc., so I thought I would purchase these for my family and see if I couldn't ""work"" them into our routine."
5;Stewpendous!;Well, all of my babies love this food.  They are sometimes a bit picky, but this food was a sure fire hit!  It is in pate form, but you can see the veggies.
5;Tastes good and natural.;This candy tastes like apple juice and vitamin C chews.It's yummy and not unnaturally green like some other apple flavor hard candies,actually not green at all it's brownish yellow.
5;Good quality espresso;This is an assortment of three types of Italian espresso pods for ESE compatible machines. The three varieties are: Mr.
4;Very healthy;I dont really worry about my weight these days.  These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch.
5;Delicious hard candy;I first purchased this candy at a truck stop-rest area in Italy and loved it. I bought a package called Capri and it had lemon and orange flavored hard candies.
4;Somewhat disappointed;I have purchased this particular item several times (10-12 canisters)and have been somewhat disappointed in at least half of these purchases.  I don't know how the process is done when adding the salt and pepper, but on most of the containers I have purchased, the salt and pepper did not stick to the cashew - hence, just another cashew!  I have waited for months in between purchases to see if the next canister is better - sometimes yes, normally no.
5;try these!;These are the best pretzels ever. Great texture,taste, and not too salty.
1;Changed formulas?;We have four indoor dogs that ever since they were puppies we have fed them science diet. The main reason was because chicken was the first ingredient.
4;I Prefer Primal Strips;I purchased Primal Strips brand vegan jerky about a year ago. It was absolutely delicious! The texture and flavor were perfect
1;Dry and crumbly;I tried these along with my girlfriend and 2 kids. No one was that excited about them.

5;Lipton Mango Manderian Tea o Go;Very disappointed I can no longer buy Lipton Mango Manderian Tea To Go.  It was my favorite summer drink.
5;bold and better than Starbucks;"Emeril's dark roasts are rich and smooth, and make the full ""largest"" size on a Keurig machine with plenty of flavor. I'm impressed at the lack of bitterness and still the ""startbuck"" like burn quality."
1;Sorry Kraft this  product is a total miss for me anyway;Sampled this on my egg salad sandwich,I thought it might be good to try something new for a change. I thought wrong.
5;Wonderful Olive Oil from a Great Retailer!;This olive oil is fragrant to the nose and wonderful on the pallet. Packaging and the provided pour spout are top shelf.
1;Torani changed their original Hazelnut flavor!;Have used the sugar-free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now. Just got this 3-pack and discovered the flavor is waaay different

5;Great product;I just love these nuts. Roasted just right and big sizes.
4;amazon prime;I saw these items advertised and thought they looked like they might be good and would like to try them. I looked at the Amazon item and found them @ 12 for 24.
1;The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?;I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered.
5;YUM!;We use this in our hot chocolate and it is the perfect amount of mint and sweetness. Lovely, delicious, quality product.
3;truffle tease not much;Oil is clear but not teases like French truffle I had before. I am not order anymore.
5;Maybe the best Green Mountain coffee;We own two Keurig Platimun coffee machines. One at home and one at the office.
2;Counterfeit? Or lousy quality control?;I also have had inconsistent results with this product. In addition, the labels on the cans aren't always the same--one indeed looks completely fraudulent.
5;Brings back memories!;I'm pregnant, and lately have been craving foods from my childhood (like peanut butter sandwiches, barbecue chips, apple juice). I've been in a soup mood lately and bought a bunch of Amy's soups at Whole Foods.
2;disappointing;The Cake was not what I expected , to have a name like Tortuga on it and be from the The Caribbean. I wanted alot more rum in the cake.
5;A great Product but bottle easily mistaken;I love this product but like many, I initally made the error of onfusing the marinade with the dipping sauce ( the sweet stuff we all know).<br /><br />  I did a little research and found that you really do need the marinade for the meat then the the dipping sauce to capture the flavor.
2;NO ALOE VERA, NO HONEY;Confusing, conflicting descriptions on this item.  There is no aloe or honey.
5;Excellent taste and decent crema;Disclosure: I used to work at Peet's coffee, so am used to a decent cup of joe. This Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve can compete with the best of Peet's decaf, IMHO.
5;Good consistent ground coffee;I have just gone through my fourth 8.8 ounce canister and I will be ordering more.
5;My Dogs LOVE this food.;I have tried this food with my very picky greyhouned and they love both the cheicken and the beef.  It does get them going on their regular food also.

5;my daily soup;For some reason, I have gotten hooked on this soup.  I literally eat it every day.
5;Bold Great Taste!;This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee.
1;Not Worth It;"First of all, the color of the powder is an ""old"" yellowish-green, not the bright green of fresh matcha. After whisking, the foam was ""pebbly"", not fine and even as it should be."
4;good mellow coffee;I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I tend to add a lot of milk and sugar to most cups of coffee to compensate for what seems to me to be bitter or too strong.
4;I like it!;This is good!  No, you probably don't want to use the largest setting because it will water it down, but I like this.  It's creamy and sweet and just the thing after a hard day at work.
5;Grape-nuts flakes;grape-nuts flakes have always been one of my favorite cereals.  I love the taste and I guess I'm weired because I like my flakes soggy, always have.
1;Too pricy;28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.
5;Great taste for diet;Has a nice taste, not that fake sugar chemical-aid type taste the some diet drinks do. Overall, very refreshing and really easy to make.
5;Nice System;I have been using the Keurig OfficePro for about a month.  It's fast heating, easy to use and clean.
4;great for granola;This coconut is absolutely wonderful in the homemade granola that I make twice a month. It really gives it slight sweetness and the texture is GREAT.
5;Smells like real food;My two cat enoy this canned food.  They come running as I get it out of the cabinet.

5;The best!;I've been buying these for several years and got them on subscription at Amazon. They always are fresh and excellent quality.
5;GREAT!!!;These are so healthy and tasty just to eat by themselves even..
1;Bought it for kids and wife;They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol.
5;LOVE!;I had a few requests for hot sauce at work and I started researching the different brands/prices and not only is Texas Pete one of the best out there but this was priced at a fantastic price!! The shipping was pretty slow but I think it may have been out of stock at the time of order . .
3;Not as expected;I ordered this nacho cheese sause hoping for something similar to what you would get at concession stands served with chips or hot pretzels. Somewhat runny with some heat to it.
5;Tasty and healthy choice of soup!;Hi! I'm pleased to have purchased Kikkoman Instant Shiro Miso. This soup is very easy to prepare.
4;Doesn't last long for agressive chewers;I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food.
5;Good price for the quantity :);It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.
1;BIG DISAPPOINTMENT;It doesn't taste like kiwi or berry. Mostly water.
5;Arizona sugar free green tea, in powder form;I love this stuff and Safeway doesn't carry it anymore. Giant does not carry it.
5;Breath chews are awesome although vets say hooey;These treats for small dogs are #1 on my dog's list of morning must haves.<br />She has been pestering me to give her a morning teenie chewy every day for many<br />months.
1;Cat owner;I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats .
5;Restaurant taste at home;With this spice mix, you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews.  It is potent, so do not use too much.
5;Great Price, Great Coffee;I know the San Francisco Bay (SFB) brand from my shopping at Costco. Now that I rely upon my single cup coffee maker for morning coffee, I'm thrilled to have the SFB coffee in a k-cup.
3;Pleasant taste, forget the hype.;A rather pleasant taste. Dissolves well with no clumps.
4;Delicious cocolate;This is delicious hot chocolate. It is best at 8 oz cup, but can be stretched to 10.
3;WAY TOO PRICEY!!;This item can be purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond for $9.99 - not the $17.
5;Good to mix with baby formula;My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.
3;Quality has now gone downhill;"I've been buying these pods for years, and have a ""Subscribe & Save"" program for them through Amazon. I like strong coffee, and these are the strongest I've found."
5;AMAZING!!!;"These uber-healthy bars do the trick whenever I have a chocolate craving. I try my best to eat ""whole food"" and this becomes difficult when I am craving something sweet."
4;Good tea, very gingery;This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.
5;Simply the BEST English Breakfast;"I love this tea and I love this brand ""Ahmad"".  It is the best tea ever because of the richest and the taste is the best."
1;Yuck!;I (and my little guy) have loved almost all other happy baby products, but this was revolting.  On the up side, my dog loves it .
1;False Advertising;The page fails to mention the fact that this Flea spray contains a pesticide in addition to the Growth Inhibitor. It's not safe for use if you have young animals or children running around.
5;best on the market;Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement.
4;One Love Better Than It Smells;One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience.
5;Our favorite Hamburger Helper variety;This is a fall-back in our house for dinner when we can
2;there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies;My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay.

5;A Taste Sensation!;I drink cinnamon tea when I get tired of the same old thing.  It's really good sweetened and with milk added.
4;Very sweet - good smell.;Quaker's Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal is adequate oatmeal and should appeal to you if you like your oatmeal sweeter than average.  For you - 4 stars.
2;What has happened to Oberto beef thin style beef jerky;I do not know what has happened to this product. I once loved it.
5;Earl grey is good.;I'm not a fan of boiling water for 1 cup of tea nor am I a fan of green tea.  This tastes good and is not bitter.
5;GREAT SNACK;"I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost.<br />It has everything that I am searching for in a, ""To Go Snack""."
5;Fog Chaser K-cups;San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is one of the best coffees my husband has ever had.  If you like a bold coffee that is not the least bit bitter, he says this is the one.
3;taste is OK and it is sweet;This is a no calorie drink, I can't taste any mango but I do taste the peach, it is sweet and really doesn't taste bad. It says it has some natural flavors but along with that are a lot of artificial junk in it like Propylene Glycol, artificial sugars.
5;Excellent;I bought these for my brother who shared them with his students<br />as he read a book about a little boy and moonpies.  All the children<br />loved them and were very excited about tasting them.
2;weird smell;This sauce kind of has a weird unappetizing smell. It smelled bad while it was cooking.
4;A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.
5;like Ranch with spices;I'm basing my review on taste alone and disregarding any nutritional information. If you like Ranch dressing with a little zing to it then you'll like this stuff.
3;Bland;My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.
5;SO HAPPY;The plants were well packed, arrived with two or three days.  They are already planted and look great.
5;"My son wasn't ""spitting up"" he was ""throwing up""";My son, who is now 4 months old, starting spitting up the regular enfamil lipil around 1 month old, and soon after that he began to throw up all most everything he ate. A friend of mine told me about the enfamil a.
5;We love this Muesli;We started buying Muesli for breakfast during a trip to France last month - and when we returned to our home in Columbia SC, couldn't find a product similar to what we enjoyed in France.  I looked around on line, and the product description of Bob's Red Mill Muesli sounded like what we liked.
5;From a picky eater - I love these;I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc.
5;We really enjoy this gnocchi;This only cooks for 2-3 minutes, so it comes in handy for a quick meal. But we do have to keep it stored in the refrigerator.
4;bonsai plant;I placed this order along with 2 other plants from the same seller early part of this month.  After 3 weeks I noticed the leaves becoming brittle and dry.
5;Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food;We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets.

2;We Men are not as strong as we like to pretend;I'm a man. As a man, I lead people to believe that I don't mind pain.

5;Amazing, Delicious, Nutritious;My husband loves these chips. The are high protein, full of fiber, and organic.
4;Marley coffee;This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust.
4;Nice service,reasonable price.;The seller did a very good job with packaging.Only thing is that the producer company filled the big jar with a half of stevia powder.
5;Heartburn healer;Excellent product. I enjoy giving it to my contacts  with any complain of stomach problems, especially at work.
1;Not a good buy;I purchased this to prevent my cat from chewing my houseplants. Followed the directions, to the letter.
5;The best cereal...;Wheat Chex<br /><br />I never imagined that our cereal would some day be delivered via UPS, but since Amazon's free-shipping price is 1/3 lower than our local Safeway, that's where we get it.<br /><br />- It tastes great, even with the non-fat milk we've been using forever.
5;So long Starbucks!;I was recently turned on to Starbucks Green Tea Frappichino. I found out what they used to make them and decided to try to make them myself.
5;Kaia Party mix is delish!;Pleasantly surprised by the Kaia Foods Sprouted Pumpkin Seeds, Party Mix. Has a nice spicey bite, crunchy, really delish! The garlic & sea salt sunflower seeds are very good too.
2;A good deal?;I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.
3;A pretty good treat;I would never consider this a healthy option, but it tastes pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of peanuts and sugar since I prefer the peanuts and salty combination, so this snack is too sweet for me.
4;Dark rich coffee;I purchased this as a hostess gift for my in-laws who have a Keurig coffee maker when I stayed with them recently.  The coffee that it made was dark, rich-tasting and thoroughly enjoyable.
4;Does the job;This shampoo has almost no scent, perhaps because it is intended for men.  It also seems to have low suds, at least less than some I have tried.
1;Bland;Soup is very bland, it made the slice of white bread I had with it seem spicy.  No real chunks of vegetables, just a couple mushy beans.
1;Yuck!;General Mills scores a big fat -0- for this new flavor of Cheerios.  Stick with the original or Honey Nut.
5;Great For Kalua Pig;I use this salt for this Kalua Pig In A Slow Cooker recipe I found, and man is it delicious. 4 pound pork butt, 1 tablespoon of this salt, and 2 tablespoons liquid smoke.
4;The best for me;The kind of gel is a matter of preference.  This flavor suits my taste.
4;Very effective trap;
4;Dog loves them - but are they safe?;These are a great price and seem to be a high-quality product.  They have a very smoky scent and the dog seems to love the taste.
5;My favorite coffee so far!;I have tried about a dozen different flavors of the k-cups and this one is just right. The perfect blend.
5;Excellent product........;This product was recommended to me by a holistic vet I found online after my cat suffered from a bladder blockage. Charlie my cat loves these.
5;Very yummy.;I love Larabars- I like to keep one on me in case I get super hungry when I'm out and about because the protein and fat content makes them very filling. Because I'm gluten intolerant and also do not eat highly processed foods, it can be pretty difficult to find something to eat away from home, but when I get really hungry I get ill anyway.
5;A retro fav is back...;..
5;my favorite;I love this tea.  It is my favorite ever.
4;Good Main Dish!;I was impressed with this product and most of the flavors by MaryJanes Farm.  Flavor was pretty good and this was very easy to make.
1;English Breakfast in name only;This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre, so why not cut back on quality and cruise on the Twinings name.
5;Coconut Sweetner;I totally love this product and use it in place of sugar or honey or syrup on cereals, waffles, and desserts.  I like it above Stevia which sometimes can leave a bitter taste.
5;great coffee;This is a low caffeine coffee which is big on flavor. We have a self-grinding coffee maker and the coffee is full flavored with no bitter taste and low acid as well.
5;Tasty mushrooms;This stuff is tasty, and good for you. Shipment was prompt and packaging was very neat.
5;Great Customer Service;My Picky Pekingnese loves these treats!  Chicken is her favorite food and with this treat she gets her favorite and something good for her combined.  This dealer is great and makes sure you are a HAPPY customer! I will definitely order this treat again and will specifically look for this Amazon dealer.
1;Nasty!;I did not think it would be so nasty. Now I am stuck with a bunch of this powder, and the only use i can find is baking where you cant really tell the difference.
5;Tastes like coffee if you use the right amount;This took a little trial and error for me to find the right amount.  The directions on the package recommend 1-2 tablespoons per cup as you would with regular coffee.
5;greenies;my pug misty is 7 years old i have given her greenies seince she was 4 months old. i give her 1 a day as a treat.
5;great tasting;I have been looking for a quick breakfast snack before I go to the gym. THis is it! It is great tasting and it keeps me going through my workout, without making me feel full.
5;Tasty!;I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal..
4;One of my favorite K-cups flavors;This is one of my favorite k-cup flavors.  The coffee roast is mild and has just the right amount of coconut flavor.
5;bisto gravy powder;This product makes the best brown gravy possible.As an ex pat englishmen I am very accustomed in using this product for roasts etc.
2;Not the Best;I didn't expect this to be so spicy! It smells great but when you taste it, it's nasty! I sweetened it as much as I could but it just didn't help. This is a shame since I like so many other Yogi teas.
5;Great Coffee;This is an excellent blend perfect for any time. Was really surprised by the quality, flavor and finish.
5;"This Brew Makes the Whole Year a ""Holiday""";I was heart broken when I heard that the Cinnamon Spice flavor of this brew was no longer being carried at Starbucks.  But Amazon to the rescue!  I found it right away and immediately bought 6 packages.
5;GREAT for fat free;I was surprised at how good these muffins were since they are fat free.  They were a little more moist (cakey) than I like muffins but still delicous.
4;Good stuff!;This is supposed to be great to fend off gout and help arthritis. I drink it daily diluted with carbonated water or Sprite.
5;Very nice;Nice big bag, smells great, tastes great.  Made lavender cookies and got lots of complements, put a bag in my drawer and it smells great.
5;After the first 3 bars, they taste great!;When I first tried these bars, I thought they were horrible.  However, I hate wasting money, so I ate a few more.
5;Excellent Flavor;This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.
5;most fabulous pepper for cooking you could buy...;I love this pepper for cooking, especially frying, especially potatoes. It is fantastic.
5;Ambers favorite;My girl (Amber) just loves her greenies.She knowes where I keep them and lets me know when she wants one.
5;Great  Product;I used this product instead in the Onion Roasted Potatoes recipe on the Onion Soup box.  Used medium sized red potatoes cubed.
5;super fast shipping, free samples;placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping
5;great price;I have used this product all year without any problems (For gluten free baking).  Works great and best price I've found.

5;beware;Kingdom chicken jerky treats..
5;mmmmh... jummy;i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors.
5;Dogs love them, a lot of treats!;I have 2 dogs, one is a small chihuahua and one is an older sheltie. The small dog eats these things like crazy, loves them.
5;This is  absolutely 1st rate Spelt. I am so grateful to find un-milled spelt that I can mill into flour my self at home.;This is wonderful Spelt, that I can mill into flour at home. There a a few other granaries  that offer Spelt that can be ground into flour at home.
3;Organic and Contains Calcium;This organic apple juice isn't bad
5;Excellent product and service;Product was very well packaged and arrived sooner than promised. I liked them so much I ordered 4 more jars.
5;Best French Vanilla we have tried...and continue to buy.;We have bought many french vanilla coffees and any other coffee that have vanilla in it. I have to say, this is one of our favorites.
5;I love it with soy milk;I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.
5;Alas, pancakes for children with alergies;My son is alergic to milk and eggs.  I discovered this product at a local health food store and fell in love with it.
5;I love these snack bars.;"KIND are my favorite snack bars -- just fruit and nuts and very little else. This is one of my favorite ""flavors."
5;Another good product in this family of hair care items;(Note:  This review is mostly the same as the one for its sister product, Volumizing Root Boost.)<br /><br />We've always bought the cheapest shampoos in the store, judging that they were all pretty much the same.
4;Very good for what it is;"We've been ""product testing"" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama ""Sushi Bar"" tea."
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;Delicious;This coconut oil is delicious.  It has the odor and flavor of expensive organic coconut oil.
5;Tasty!;I was happy to see that I could purchase this on Amazon. Previously had to go to our local health food store.
1;too pricey;I have been buying this for years, it has always been two boxes of 50 pods each for the $59.98.
5;Great quality. Heathful product.;A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits.

5;This drink helped me kick Coke;I was a 2 can a day Coke drinker.  Knowing how unhealthy that was, the only beverage that enabled me to kick that bad habit was this [[ASIN:B003D4MIE6 R.
5;Love this product;I purchased this in a store which is now not carrying it.  It's my favorite cracker.
4;Made in China;I have been having good luck with these with my two lab mutts.  I load a couple into a Busy Buddy for each of them and they love them.
5;Island Escape!;I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.
5;Awesome product;My Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy loves this stuff. He initially was eating Eukenuba from the breeder, but once we got home we found that the large pieces were hard for him to break up at 8 weeks and he didn't seem to be too excited for meals.
1;worst coffee ever;This coffee was not even drinkable. It was so strong even adding double the water and extra cream and sugar didn't help.
4;Excellent coffee;I ordered Dark Sumatra Gayoland coffee bean from Coffee Bean Direct via Amazon. It came 1 day earlier than scheduled date.
5;Great product;Our cats have traditionally lived between 18-22 years. We have been feeding them Iams forever.
4;Hard to find Chocolate Licorice;I was so happy to find the chocolate licorice as it was for a gift for a friend that grew up eating chocolate licorice.  She had been unable to find it anywhere so Amazon came thru.
5;These are my favorite and only snack...;SnaPea Crisps are one fabulous food, or snack.  I do not feel a bit guilty eating an entire bag, the way I would with, say, Doritos.
5;an excellent tea;I use a lot of different flavoured herbal teas and I usually look for a stonger flavoured tea and this is a good one..
5;My favorite flavored coffee EVER;Coconut sounded like a weird flavor for coffee, but then I remembered: years ago my favorite little coffee shop ago made a delicious Almond Joy-inspired drink that prominently featured coconut flavor, and I had completely embraced that recent Toasted Mochanut Frappuccino that tasted like a Samoa/Caramel Delight Girl Scout cookie ..
5;Great blend to get the day started =);I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common..
5;Authentic NYC Vanilla Egg Cream;This is the real McCoy!!  Many New Yorkers insist chocolate is the only egg cream..
5;Dog says its good;I gave this to my dog to make her want to go uinto her cage.  She still doesn
1;Not Good;So you want some tasty flavorful potato chips, seriously why bother with these. Please understand they are baked.
3;Too salty...;I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.
1;Yuck!;These are TERRIBLE! I gave it 1 star because you aren't allowed to rate 0 stars. On the scale of 1-5 stars, this product rates way below 0! I think plain birdseed would taste better.
5;Canterbury Naturals pancake mix;I received this product as part of a gift.  I loved it so much<br />I ordered it online because it was not available for<br />purchase anywhere.
4;Pungent!;Normally, I love any mustard, as long as it isn't yellow.  That being said, this one is different.
3;Great price!;I got an excellent deal on this cereal within the Warehouse Deals section.  Leaves a slightly strange after-taste, but is overall palatable.
5;Barbeque perfection;The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard.
5;Bergin Nut Company Oat Bran;Really delicious. I put 1 cup of oat bran into 3 cups of water in the microwave and cooked it until it was done.
1;Angry;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Happy Times Crazy Crunchies Carrot Apple Bits (Freeze Dried);Fantastic Find! With preschool just around the corner, I'm always on the hunt for fun, tasty, healthy and organic snacks for my three year old!  I've been really impressed with Happy Family's line of products and their new Happy Times items really seem to be growing with my family.  Not only are each of these individually packaged, perfect for the school lunch box, they even have a cute little 'message' area where I write basic little notes or draw a little picture to surprise my little girl as she enjoys her lunch at school.
5;Great product, super fast shipping!;My kids love all of the Annie's crackers but this snack mix is their favorite. It's cheesey but not overpowering and has good flavor.
4;Great food - on a slow mule.;I love Swiss Colony foods.  Perhaps not as much as Hickory Farms, but their summer sausage is quite delectable.
5;Pretty Good;I'm the only one in my apartment with a gluten intolerance, but we like to cook communal and quick meals. This was a hit with the normal folk I live with, and we buy it pretty often.
1;Too sugary, not fruity, laxative effect;I've tasted green tea infusions before and they are usually quite tasty Chantea is not tasty, infact it is too sweet, has an aftertaste, tasted like canned artificial lycees, plus acted like a fast laxative.  I originally come from the tropics so I definitely know how good, fresh passion fruit tastes like and there is no such taste in this drink.
1;Mold?;Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food.
5;Delicious!;I was looking for an alternative for a great protein source that is low in fat.  This is it!  These ostrich turkey sticks are just packed with flavor.
5;Good stuff!;Packed with fruits and some nuts. Tasty without being too sugary.
5;Bird's Custard;Unbelievable taste!!! 2nd to none. Doesn't like to be doubled or tripled from the original recipe, so watch that.
5;Dental chews for dogs teeth;My dogs like these the best and I'm glad if it cleans their teeth.  I bought a 32-count for what I felt was a very reasonable price and will buy more, hopefully for the same price.
3;Good for a preground coffee;I would like have more of a kick, but it's a lot better than most Keurig and superior to our local Dunkin Donuts fresh brew. Dunkin's K-cup is not in the same ballpark.
5;Love love love them;When the men are away, the women don't want to cook. These are really great because the taste is good (driiink something with them), they satisfy your hunger for a meal, and they are healthy.
2;Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE;Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.
1;Not Vegan at All!;"I bought this product to make some vegan milk soap. However, after reading the ingredients ""."
1;Gag Me;I'll say for starters that I am a caffeine junkie.  I have been a coffee drinker since I was a very, very young lad.
1;Tasted bad. Tossed most in the trash;I lived in the islands for 5 years and I know coconut water.  This stuff is garbage.
5;Chef Michael dog food;I use this dog food along with food that I make and feel that my dog is getting his full nutritional requirements.  The price ordering from Amazon is better than stores where I live, not to mention the fact that I cannot find the larger sized bag here.
1;Product Seemed Old;I don't know how long the product sat on the shelf, but the windee rings smelled a little rancid.  I did not give to the dogs.
5;dark belgian chocolates;These made my Mom's day. She LOVES dark chocolate and this was a treasure trove for her and she can't thank me enough for sending these.
1;AWFUL!!;Had to toss out 5 1/2 tubs.  Could not stand eating them.
4;Does Double Duty;It seems, having a look at other Voices' reviews, that I'm not alone in discovering that Quaker Oatmeal Squares make an excellent snack all on their own (and in fact, with the exception of one bowl with milk, this is how I consumed my box within a very few days). However, that's not to say that they're not good with milk.
4;My dog seems to like this puzzle;I have a beagle and we have never bought a doggy puzzle for him before, so I was looking for something easy and also something that would make him use his great sense of smell. This puzzle is perfect! Although he figured it out in about 10 seconds, it is something that can be reused over and over again due to the 4 treat chambers.
5;good hydration for stomach flu;My first time trying coconut water happened when a good friend had a stomach flu and need effective hydration. I went to the local coffee shop and it was among the few drinks they had on hand, and the label stated that it was excellent as a sports drink alternative and for hydration generally.
5;Coffee;Keurig brewers product, tastes great, brews quickly, and disposes of easily,  will definately purchase this product again in the future. Price again a factor - and delivered right to your door.
5;Quite the hit!!;When I first received Haley's (my dog) package of Zoe Anti-Oxidant Dental Chew Treats (medium size), I took Haley and 3 of the treats to my neighbor's house to visit and share with her dogs. All 3 dogs LOVED the treats and got very possessive of their own.
5;Great for keeping away hairballs!;I absolutely love this product.  The cats enjoy them and they keep hairballs away.
5;Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food;When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.
1;if your baby is really fussy and gassy, this is not the formula you want - try Alimentum instead!;First, these cans are a pain, really inconvenient. You have to open with a can opener and there is no easy way to pour it out of the can.
3;Decent but Not Particularly Strong Coffee;The first thing you will notice with Marley Coffee is it smells really good.  Unfortunately once you brew it is not as strong as I would like it, but still a serviceable coffee.
5;Wow;Wonderful Dark Chocolate and its my Fav..
5;Excellent coffee;This is really an excellent coffee. Nice clean flavorful taste.
5;Amazing Flavor!;I have already reviewed several of the flavors and gave them 5 stars.  My favorite has always been the Cranberry Almond but I think the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt is going to rapidly become my favorite.
4;Post workout treat;I am really impressed with the Tanka Buffalo sticks. Great flavor without being too spicy and a great post work out treat! A little dry but otherwise perfect.
5;Amazing flavor.;If you have a dolce gusto machine, do yourself a favor and try this. I think they hit this out of the park.
4;Great stuff;This is great stuff for all foods!  I wish they still sold it in stores tho.  Great deal on 12 bottles too.
1;Stay Away Unless You Like The Taste Of Bug Spray!!!;I don't know who does the taste testing for this company but none of their flavor coffee tastes anything like what they advertise. This product does not taste anything like a chocolate glaze donut.
5;Travels easy - good taste;I've been a stevia fan for a few years now.  Usually I buy it in 1.
5;Great to have on hand;I've used dried mushrooms many times over the years and these are among the best.  Though expensive the morel has great flavor and is easily reconstituted.
3;Great taste, but expensive;This is probably the best tasting nutrition shake that I've had, and I've had many.  It was a decent bargain when it was under $15, but now at nearly $19 for only 6 cans it is way over priced.
5;A family favorite;When I start it is hard to stop. This candy is one that my children bought for their father every year.
2;My labradoodle couldn't care less;I brought Nylabones because of a friend's recommendation, but my 10 week old puppy doesn't even give these a second glance ..
1;Safety concerns;My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China.<br />It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand.
5;Excellent alternative to regular Cola - Black Cherry Switch;"Much better than I expected, Switch Black Cherry is an excellent ""soda"" type carbonated fruit juice drink.  The drink gets its sweetness from fruit juice and almost as sweet as regular soda."
2;Keurig Hot Chocolate Pods;It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.
5;Healthy & They LOVE It!;My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version).
1;Tastes like plastic.;I reheated this out of the plastic bowl--and even reheated in a ceramic bowl, it tastes like, and smells like, plastic
5;Yum!;I had this in the store to break out of the normal coffee routine, and it was great. Unfortunately I had to buy it online, but the quality is just as good as it was in the store.
5;For gluten sensitive bakers;"Having recently made the move to gluten free eating, I have been searching for products that make things taste ""normal"".  In Cooking for Isaiah, by Silvana Nardone, (an excellent gluten/dairy free cookbook, by the way) brand names for cooking products are given."
5;Happy dogs;I have 2 dogs that love these things.  Nice to get a large quanity, because buying them at the store individually can cost 2-3 times as much.
5;Happy Chewers;My Press Canarios are very happy with these chews and I am because they are USA produced. Great value for the price.
5;Excellent for Dogs with Atopic Dermatitis;I have a Lhasa Apso/Shih Tzu mix with severe allergies. I bathe her every week to help alleviate her itchy skin and to make her feel better.
1;Product arrived in poor condition;The bag of dove chocolates that I order were left on my doorstep in the middle of the day.  Being summertime, it was quite hot outside and the chocolates melted partially.
4;Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem;My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.
5;the best raisin bran cereal;This is by far the best raisin bran cereal I have ever tasted.  The sweetness is just right.
5;Awesome. Totally hit the spot everytime.;I love these bars - especially the cranberry bars. I allow myself 1 per day.
4;Very convenient, good taste, a tiny bit too sweet;I don't like warm coffee, and my iced coffee needs a little sweetener.  This has a LITTLE too much, but the pure convenience along with the cost makes this worth buying for me.
5;"Better than ""real"" milk";As most cats can not digest the lactose in real milk this is a great substitute if you want to give your cat a milk like treat.  I have one cat who loves to play in the water dish but is not really found of drinking it.
3;too expensive!;this product was way too expensive.  I thought that by ordering it online it would be cheaper.
5;The dog gives one paw up;The dog (and cats) love these treats - good for reinforcing behaviors and getting attention when shaking the bag. Haven't tried me myself so can't give a personal review.
4;Good but really sweet;The bars taste good but are very sweet (18 grams per bar).  Would not recommend shipping during the summer to the southern US states, they melt a little.
5;Good treat for sesame taste lovers;I frequently buy this snack from my nearest fresh farms market and its very tasty. Its powered by benefits of sesame seeds and taste of honey.
4;great oatmeal;My son and daughter love McCanns's!  When we were having trouble getting it locally, I bought a famous store brand of flavored oatmeal.  The kids both hated it!  They like the natural flavor of McCann's and the courser consistency.
5;yummy;These are exactly as we used to get wayyy back when..
5;Morning Comfort;My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but.
4;love Charms!;I used to eat these lollipops as a kid. Over the years, they have been hard to find-except.
5;Great full bodied flavorful coffee;I drink decaf only and only used whole beans.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this coffee taste.
5;Fantastic!  Roscoe Loves it!;"Our 1 year old boxer/pit-bull ""pup"" loves his antler! He is 70 lbs, and has a big old head with an alligator-like mouth.  Despite the fact he gets a lot of daily exercise, he still has plenty of energy and loves to chew in his spare time."
3;A drink without a category;I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.
5;My dog loves these....;I bought these for my golden retriever to try.  He just loves these treats.
5;A Four Red Fruits Tea rocks;Four red fruits tea adds a wonderful berry flavor to our iced tea.  I get a gallon of warm water from the tap, put in 2 family sized decaf tea bags, plus a 4 Red Fruits, 2 Peach, & a Blackberry.
4;Dandy and tasty simple meal, easy to prepare and serve;The other reviewer must have been in a bad mood or feeling a bit above it all. This is a fine meal and keeps you from going hungry.
2;"""Peppery"" is the Word";Wow..
5;Mmmmm Mmmm good;I LOVE this stuff. I mix 1 scoop of this with Carnation Instant Breakfast (no sugar added) for a protein packed drink that has the caffeine I need.
2;Gift this;Unless you like the variety which is good, this is for others. No matter how I sorted through this I ended up with flavors I did not like so gave it away.
5;Don't knock it til ya try it.;You'd be surprised how much Runa Tea can help you in your daily life. Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways.
1;bad packaging;The Maca powder came in the same box as the truck ball mount and tore open he Maca bag.  The ball mount, which is metal,  should<br />have been wrapped in bubble wrap.
5;Best green tea available;I first saw this tea in a trip to Japan and was really amazed when I saw it was available in the US. It's very pure, has a strong taste and is actually the only tea I believe is natural.
5;Really, REALLY good!!;I love these.  I break them out when I am too busy to fix a meal, when I want a snack, or even sometimes when someone drops by and I am randomly pulling things from the pantry.
3;bitter taste but good for you and high quality;Upside: it doesnt hav ea bunch of garbage in it like regular choco (Hershey, Ghirrardelli).<br /><br />Downside: It doesn't taste like the chocolate that most americans are used to.
4;Now Pom & Petals Tea;"Unlike the other reviewers for this product, I never tried the ""Pomegranate Rose"" version of this tea, and so I cannot compare it to the product they are now sending, which is called Pom & Petals. On the actual company website for Zhena's Gypsy Tea they seem to make it sound like the two teas are identical and they have simply changed the name."
3;Not my dogs's favorite;I consider Purina a reputable brand and my golden retriever really likes Purina Dog Chow, so this seemed like a healthy alternative. My dog ate the food and did end up finishing the bag, but I could tell she didn't love it.
5;Makes killer tamales!!;I purchased Bob's Red Mill Golden Masa a few months ago, but I have been using it often since then.  I made a ton of tamales for Christmas and New Years and they turned out unbelievable.
5;Cotton Candy - YUM!;Cotton Candy Match!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!  I loved Cotton Candy as a kid and still at the age of thirty-seven will buy cotton candy when I see it.  My hubby humors my childlike excitement.
2;Only flavor I did not like at all;I like all of the flavors to a degree, except this one.  It's really salty and the combination of flavors isn't good.
1;Not the same as the can;Very disappointed.  I went by the picture and description.
5;Very good;I really enjoy this soup.  It is very filling and hearty.
3;Buy from Bonsai Boy, not 9GreenBox;When I first looked at this bonsai and the pictures of what other people had received, I thought this would be a great purchase. However, I bought the $6.
5;Great snacks!;These Puffs are great and my son loves them. They are really convenient for snacks on-the-go.
5;I kinda like it;But the truth is that I think it is bad for me.  Nothing is real in it.
5;A treat for me;These tea pyramids continue to delight me, and these are especially fun - the leaf balls are fun to watch, the smell of jasmine puts a few moments of escape into my work day. Overpackaged for the environmental crowd.
5;Smells delicious, and it works, too;This Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil smells so delicious that I was thinking about eating some. But then I read the ingredients, and it contains things I've never heard of like Hydrogenated styrene, Tocopheryl Acetate, and Helianthus Annuus.
5;Great for training and dogs who just love getting treats!;I originally bought a 6 ounce bag of these treats at my local pet store for 4$ a bag.  The owner recommended them because they are made from healthy items, and they are only 3 calories a treat.
4;my absolute favorite;this really has a nice, buttery, toffee flavor that comes through. i find a lot of the other coffees are all aroma with weak flavor.
5;Fantastic!;I can't go back to any other mashed potatoes after eating these!  I would honestly prefer these over real mashed potatoes.  They are so creamy and just seems to have a nice balance of everything that comes together to make a great texture and taste!  Had these for Thanksgiving dinner and several people wanted to know my recipe for the mashed potatoes.
5;Just who does not like oreos;nom nom nom. Oreos are just delicious at every age.
5;Great way to save money;I have found that buying these soups from Amazon is saving me time, money and calories. Those of us who are fortunate to have jobs are all super busy and find ourselves working and meeting through our lunches.
5;Cut Rock Candy;This candy is very true to color, as yellow will be lemon, red will be cherry, etc.  The only little problem is that the  candies do stick together at times.
1;Not happy;Much too expensive for the small amount of product received. I've found that this brand is over the top in price.
4;Duck Sauce;Sauce was just as I expected. Taste is excellent.
2;Sweet potato flour;We were searching for something lower in carbs than wheat flour.  Sweet potato flour is not, unfortunately.
5;Wonderful aroma.;I've had success with the Numi black tea and wanted to try the green. The reviews suggested this tea and I'm glad I tried it.
5;Love It;Tastes Great. Easy to make.
5;Blue Corn Chips Taste Really Good;These corn chips are crispy and taste great. And very few broken chips in the bag (I like my chips whole).
1;Nasty upon Nasty;I'm not a picky eater and will try almost anything. To say this stuff is nasty is an understatement.
5;Delicious medium roast coffee!!;Love this stuff! It is somewhat similar to Kenyan AA..
3;Tasted better in Japan;Like other reviewers, I was smitten with this tea while traveling abroad. Amazon's price seems unbeatable, and the subscription offer makes it even more attractive.
5;LOVE this protein shake!!!;If I could give this 10 stars I would! I am lactose intolerant and a distance athlete and need to supplement my protein intake. It is very hard to find soy protein in retail stores, as they all sell Whey.
5;Golden Berries (incan) are my new favorite snack!;I bought these with an order of Sunfood's goji berries, not really knowing what to expect. They're 1000% not like the raisins that they appear to be in the photo! Instead, they're tangy and sweet, with one of the most interesting textures out there.
2;Try a sample first if you can;I like strong coffee/espresso and was excited to try Jet Fuel after reading the reviews here.  After a week of drinking this coffee however, maybe I have a different definition of strong coffee.
4;Good but a slightly weird aftertaste;"The packaging says ""surprisingly addicting"" and that says it all. This is good and satisfies my need for salty foods, but you will have an odd aftertaste like you just ate sushi."
5;Quality protein;Great quality protein and suitable for vegans. It is cheap price for 4 pounds (64 ounces).
1;Why not to buy the country olive mix;I have been buying olives from Amazon for years and these are the worst I have received. The mix was supposed to have cracked olives, for some reason I was thinking cracked green olives with coriander, like they have in Cyprus.
5;YUM~;Oh, my goodness!  And I do mean GOODNESS.  These are great
2;It was not adequately specified;It said is a Cinnamos Gum and when qe received it it was Cinnamint.  I was looking for only Cinnamon Gum.
5;Perfect Brownies;I have noticed as I have grown, my tastes have become more particular in some areas. Brownies are one such area.
5;excellently AWFUL;OK. I purchased this last week and eat the first box without looking at back side.
5;Tastes just like bacon!;I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco.
3;IF YOU LIKE REALLY ORDINARY COFFEE...;My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso.
4;The best product Jelly Belly has ever made;These beans represent Jelly Belly's finest work, period.  My only caveat is that the beans ship directly in the box, no plastic bag or the like.
5;Good Product!;My daughter is on a Gluten-Free Casein-Free diet and this is one of the only snack foods I can get her to eat.  3yr olds aren't known for their desire for new and different foods so this has become a staple snack food for her.
5;Super Yummy;I love these chips! They are lower in fat but better in taste that most other chips. The price is right too at the case price.
5;Rich dark chocolate;"The ""Endangered Species Panther, Extreme Dark Chocolate"" is very rich in flavor and to be savored.  The individually wrapped pieces allow you to select just that one small piece after dinner to enjoy with your coffee."
5;No worries about plastic leaching;"I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible ""leaching"" of harmful byproducts into the oil.  Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle."
5;Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!;Love these! Well, because..
5;Love It!;I love all things Fresh..
4;cheese crock;The delivery was very quick.  The only thing, was the crock that I saw was a brown copper color and that's what I wanted, but what was delivered was blue.
1;Awfull, Awfull, Awfull;I have never tasted something so awfull in my life! I like gas station cappuccino, I have no problem w/it. But, this cappuccino has something wrong w/it.
4;Great stuff!;I agree with the writer who suggests making it a topping for hotcakes or waffles. I, however, use it straight.
5;great;Exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper. Recommended for any Keurig drinkers out there.
1;Not shelf stable, molds in jar;I bought 2 jars of this a couple of months ago, from Amazon. The jars both say best before July 2011 and refrigerate after opening.
1;fox u bet;I recently purchases fox u bet chocolate syrup.<br />It was awesome.
4;Sweet and tangy berry bits in great dark chocolate;The rating above is for the chocolate itself, not for the taste of the chocolate I got from Amazon. My chocolate arrived as if it had melted and cooled a couple times and was flaky, this gave it a not so smooth texture, although the flavor was still there, I don't like the grainy feeling of melted and then cooled again chocolate that much.
5;only place to get .;Excellent tasting product.very hard to find in stores.
5;dried cranberries;these are so amazing, i have them on subscribe and save.  difficult to find any dried fruits that do NOT contain sulphites or sugar, and these DO NOT and are only sweetened with apple juice, not sugar.
5;No mushy pasta here!;This is our favorite pasta.  It is delicious.
5;Great on yogurt.;This tastes really good on my yogurt.  It is so hard to find gluten free granola but I love the Kind brand.
5;Better than expected;Certainly better than expected. That's not saying a lot as I expected junk since I was buying bulk olives off a site originally dedicated to selling books but, still, they're good.
5;A nice surprise;I bought this because it's organic and I did want to keep some chicken in a can on hand.  The surprise was how flavorful this is.
1;Amazon shipped the wrong Product! Oats were ordered, Multigrain was shipped.;I ordered Country Choice Organic Oven Toasted Old Fashioned Oats, 18-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I received pack of 6 cannisters with Rye, Oats, Wheat and Barley.<br /><br />Amazon screwed up the fulfillment and shipped the wrong product!<br /><br />I did not discover until the pack and one of the canisters was opened.
1;So gross!;I bought this product because we knew Tyler Florence was a wonderful chef and thought for sure it'd be great. I tasted this first and about gagged.
1;NOT metallic;There is nothing metallic about this color. It is gold in the fact that it is yellow, but that is it.
5;GREAT!!!!;GOOD STRONG FLAVOR AND AROMA! iT'S MY MORNING WAKE UP CALL ON MY FIRST CUP.<br />SECOND CUP TOPS OFF MY BREAKFAST.
5;Yummy, Fruit Filled, GF Cereal!;Yummy! This gluten free cereal is absolutely delicious! I love that it is filled with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, but not too many. The cereal has a touch of sweetness, and the berries help add some sweetness too.
5;Excellent Tea;When I read Purple Antioxidants, I figured ok, it's still probably going to look like Green Tea when brewed..
3;alo ALLURE Aloe Vera and Mangosteen and Mango;I am not happy that this product contains only  25% juice.  However, I like<br />the taste and also like that it has bits of the Mango in it.
5;Good for you;This product was recommended to me by my dietician. I am now off any<br />medicine to control Clorestyrol level and using just diet and Benecol<br />to control it.
5;Worth checking a bag for.....;Anytime I am back in New York, I head to Zabars on the UpperWest Side and buy at least<br />3, or usually 5, cinnamon babkas. No other babka is as heavily loaded with cinnamon<br />sugar swirl.
1;Bad reaction to the coffee, had to cancel my subscription;"I bought the coffee because I have bad reaction to regular coffee and this organic coffee was not a good fit.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www."
5;Good value;Love them! I've used other brands and they didn't tear well. These are sturdy and tear off well.
5;Wonderful!;Very pleased.  A nice crunch and very good flavor.
5;amazing!....;I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey.
4;Good product, but sort of expensive;Our family used these bags for a while..
2;Not what I expected.;I'm new to the tea drinking world so I thought a sampler pack would have a wider flavor range. This sampler all taste pretty much the same.
5;Great deal;You get a huge jar of capers, of larger size than those crummy little jars in stores ( 3.5 oz.
5;Delicious mocha;Very tasty, just a hint of coffee. You can adjust the thickness of the frappe by the amount of ice you add to the blender.
5;Very tasty with a compelling crunch.;I wrote this review initially as part of an online conversation. I actually bought these at Whole Foods rather than here on Amazon.
4;Pretty good so far with slight modification;I bought this dispenser to replace a Bags om Board bone dispenser which worked great until it fell off my leash and I lost it. The problem with the bone dispenser was the plastic ring that attached it to the leash popped open and the bone dispenser fell off the leash without me knowing it  --and this was after only having it for 2 weeks! I decided to order the white dispenser but wasn't too impressed with the plastic zip tie that attached it to the leash either-- as another reviewer pointed out, the end of the plastic tie irritated my hand, the tie itself couldn't be readjusted once you attached it, and I was afraid the plastic tie would eventually break off and I'd lose this dispenser too.
4;Very Powerful;I used this dye for a mixed drink for Halloween.  Works great and a little goes a long way.
5;Worth Every Penny - Wellness CORE dry and Wellness Grain Free canned;Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.
3;It's just ok...;I have been using this product all month with very little to say about it. Initially it does make your face feel really soft and hydrated, BUT it does not last.
2;My Aussie kinda likes them;My 5-year-old Australian shepherd, Pete, has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months, so I was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat.<br />I placed a regular size Milk Bone, a small Beggin' Strip, and a Zoe treat stick side-by-side on the carpet and invited Pete to help himself.
2;Just OK;I bought this tea after purchasing the same blend at our local tea store, so had the opportunity to compare the two side by side.  Here's my take:  Before brewing, my local tea store's Cassis/Black Currant clearly had significantly more flavor, smelled fresher, and had much longer tea leaves than did the SerendipiTea brand.
5;GREAT little cracker-awesome to make smores!;My daughter has eaten gluten free for 8 years now (she's 13).  These are her favorite crackers and the only ones we eat in the house (I don't have any wheat here).
5;Addictive, but it does have fat;"The description says ""no fat"" but it is really ""no fat added"".  It does contain some fat but its less then other granola."
5;Delicious and Gluten-Free;These cookies are delicious and gluten-free. I bought them as a gift for my daughter who has Celiac disease.
5;Awesome Deal;This is an awesome deal, arrived without damage and not melted (then again it is February in Indiana, so it is cold). Great gift for someone who loves these.
5;My Favorite Tea Licorice Spice!;Those of you who love black licorice or anise flavor - this is it! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic, it's intense. In my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary! Good for your daily diet but remember this is not a wimpy tea, it's full bodied.
5;Excellent Price;Changed to this food recently, then had to change again due to vet's recommendation to go to a non meat, non poultry protein source. Can only comment that this food received a very good rating on Dog Food Advisor, a great site that impartially and scientifically reviews dog food quality.
2;YUCKY! Not worth my weight watchers points!;I bought these with the hopes I could eat them at the movie theater and save myself the extra calories. I started Weight Watchers 3 months ago and you can have 7 vines for 2 points which is really good.
1;DO NOT BUY! TASTE LIKE CR@P;This is the worst tasting chocolate bar ever. I think if actual poo has a taste this would be it.
5;Perfect SAFE Sweetener;This is an excellent way to sweeten whatever you need it for.  You can't tell the difference from the sugar you're so used to.
5;Rice!;I have used this product for almost a year, purchasing it from health food stores. Buying from Amazon is much more economical.
5;My Baby loves it!;My baby boy loves eating this food, better than some Earth's best Stage 3 foods.  It doesn't taste too bad either.
5;Very happy with Chocolate Oranges;I'm very happy with Terry's Chocolate Oranges.  My sons head straight to their stockings Christmas morning - just to dig out these fabulous treats.
5;Awesome tea - great value;Best bagged pure green tea out there. Great flavor.
5;The best instant miso...or was the best;I've sampled several at-home, instant miso soups.  Miso-Cup has the best taste and is a reasonable price.
5;Joey loves these;My mini-poodle, Joey, has chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and thyroid disease.  She is allergic to beef and corn.
5;Fantastic!!!;I ordered these for a friend who is from Canada and these always were her favorite candy bar as a child.  She can never find them in the U.
5;Excellent price for a world class coffee;This coffee was shipped promptly and well packaged. The freshly ground coffee from the Boquete region is flavorful, aromatic and without the acidity of coffees from other regions.
5;BEST Hot Chocolate EVER!;So chocolaty and spiced just right! I decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews. I'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind.
1;Very disapointing!!;I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels.
5;Love these!;The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor.
4;Senseo Paris Coffee Pods - easy route to good coffee;So long as you have a pod type coffee machine, the Senseo Pods, in all their variations, make a good cup of coffee easily. If you drink one or two cups of coffee per day they are worth the price of the machine and the pods.
5;Milk!  It does a body good!;My husband and I started drinking non-fat dry milk eons ago and when we found the Saco brand in the stores we frequented, we snapped them up.<br />Unfortunately, our stores quit carrying it and we had to look elsewhere.
2;ok, beans may have been old?;We were very excited to try shome Italian espresso beans and read great reviews for this brand but we're disappointed. Most espresso blends we have purchased are dark and seem to have an oily look.
4;Yummy!;Delicious taste, but it's way too crunchy. It hurts my teeth and gums.
5;Best K-Cup,  Full-flavored and Not Bitter;This is excellent and the best I have found for the Keurig maker.  I tried all the assorted flavors that came with the Keurig and they were all weak and horrible.
5;A wonderful introduction to flavoured matcha!;It took me a long time to finally place an order for some Red Leaf Tea matcha, and now that I have it in my hands (and my tummy!) I wish I had have purchased it sooner.<br /><br />I was unsure whether I would find it too much of a fuss to prepare matcha myself, or whether I would enjoy the delicious sweet grassy taste of matcha paired with rich flavourings.
3;o.k. not great;as a flavor infused oil these lack any real flavor as far as i could taste. as olive oil its ok-not the best not the worst.
5;Delicious and great price;These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.
2;Vastly prefer Xyloburst brand;My wife and I have been going through the different brands of Xylitol gums/mints/products for the past 2 years.  We decided to try the Xlear Spry stuff because it was cheaper.
5;Dee-licious! (And healthy);I hate instant oatmeal. I thought I hated ALL oatmeal until I tried Steel Cut.
5;Dandy Blend;I was advised to stop drinking coffee or any caffeinated products, even so called decaffeinated products. I remembered that there was a product called Postum and as I recalled it did not taste good.
5;item is wonderful, don't buy here though;i was looking to see if i can get a better deal than 2.79 a box that i pay at my local, regular, supermarket.
5;Entire family likes this! Satisfying meal w RICE;fYI: entire package = about 1 cup of stew.  Not that much! Would definitely need rice/nan plus a side dish (salad?) to make this a meal for two.
5;Best brown rice...;"I typically do not like brown rice due to its' ""brown paper"" like taste.<br />I decided to try this and what a difference!<br />It cooks up like a very fluffy white rice and the texture and taste is wonderful."
5;Just can't get enough...;Delicious, perfect. An all-natural fruit drink with fewer calories than a comparable non-diet beverage.
4;It's Funny To Think The Titular Character Is Only In The Movie Less Than Twenty Minutes;Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).
5;Coffee;Amazing experience every time. The taste of cinamaon and hint of sweetness in just the right amounts.
5;Hearts of Palm;"Excellent product, great value with free shipping! I have been purchasing these on a regular basis for two or three years and the result has been consistently positive. I save $12 - $15 off retail prices in my area and the quality is much better than ""the cheapest"" alternative."
4;dog loves it;i have a lab mix, with a lot of energy-and this toys actually keeps her very busy. Buy lots of refills.
3;dog didnt like it;My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.
1;fake elderberry tea;"All drinks,hot or cold, should be labeled if it has caffeine in it there are some people can't have caffeine because of certain heart conditions it could put them in the hospital or worse! I would rate this tea O, because of lake of information I became ill!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Very Tasty Organic Granola;I do not like granola but this mix is excellent. Hemp and flax do not sound tasty, but the blend with the organic oats and pumpkin seeds is very nice.
5;Great Flavor!  Excellent Choice for Weening from Cofee;I love the flavor..
4;Love it! Taste's Great!;I was a little skeptical when I bought this product despite all the great reviews. I've never found a meal shake that I've come close to actually liking.
5;Perfect every day coffee.;I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold.
5;Worth trying;This tea has a smooth, well rounded flavor and goes very well with steamed milk. I drink tea all day, and Earl Grey is my go to black tea.
5;Perfect if you're in a hurry;You can't go wrong with the oatmeal in a cup..
1;Broken cookies.;We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition.
5;Navitas Naturals Lucuma powder;I bought lucuma when I went to Lima, Peru and thought I could never get it anywhere fresh but there. Until I gave Navitas Naturals a shot.
5;My puppy loves them!;My puppy is a 12 week old French Bulldog / Boston Terrier mix.  She just loves these bones!  They're about the only thing that can get her to sit still.
5;cookie of the future - pure, non-gmo;I have gluten sensitivity but when I ate this cookie, it did not<br />bother me.  In general I have noticed I am able to eat things<br />with wheat or corn that are non-gmo.
5;Very good overall.;Genmai cha is green tea with rice, and has a smooth, almost nutty flavor. I find it to be a very satisfying tea, great for drinking all throughout the day.
5;FRESH AND YUMMY;I recently bought 2 packages of Bergin Pecans and my family immediately requested Pecan Pancakes for a full week.  They were fresh and oh so good!  I have also noticed that purchasing Bergin Pecans through Amazon is cheaper than purchasing pecans from my local markets.
5;Addictive Coffee;Tully's Coffee Kona Blend is wonderfully addictive !  Beats out any of it's competitors !  We love to have a cup or two in the morning to start out the day.  The packaging was a little beat up due to scrunching of the boxes, but the contents inside were in perfect condition.
1;stale;avoid it, this is old stale coffee. I gave it a try because it was low price at the time, I guess i know where old coffee goes now.
4;Nice Mild & Sweet Cinnamon;This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels.
5;Healthier option with great flavor.;My family loves these and the fact that the primary ingredient is fruit juice makes them a somewhat better option than candy.  The pieces are a good size and the flavors are great.
5;Great stuff;We use this beef stock to make a faux soy sauce for my son who is allergic to all kinds of foods. This is the only brand of beef stock we have found that is safe.
5;very good cereal;This cereal is very good
5;Best Pork Rinds Ever!;I first purchased this product a few months ago after a co-worker mentioned them.  So I decided to try them out for myself.
5;Easily the best pod coffee I've tried;Various pods from different companies either don't fit my Senseo very well or produce indifferent coffee.<br /><br />These pods fit perfectly and brew easily the best cup of coffee of any of the pods I've tried.
5;very good - just oil & salt;I used to eat another brand similar to this natural flavor, but it disappeared from shelves, so I tried the O.R.
1;Sour Smell emailed company;I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away.
5;Organic and not too sweet;There is a definite, crisp and crunchy texture to these bars. Some other bars have a slight chemical aftertaste.
5;The best snack!;I can't believe everyone who rated these didn't give them 5 stars!  I always have these on hand, and everyone who I let try them NEEDS to know where they can get them. I  have never met anyone who didn't love them!  I like the sour cream and onion flavor as well!  What a great healthy, low fat snack.
5;Surprisingly Economical, Convenient, Healthy;My husband and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much we've come to love this product. We tried Ganocafe because a friend gave us a sample.
3;Vanilla;I have only tried this flavor but it's good! No need for additional flavour shots. It's perfect for a cool evening.
5;Pedigreee Good Bites Skin & Coat;I had previously purchased but recently I looked for these at our local stores and could not find. My dog loves them and I do believe they help her coat to shine.
5;Good tea;I bought my mom this tea and I think she's addicted to it. She's real picky about teas, seeing as she'll blow cash on high-end jasmine and oolong teas.
5;Great Food at a Great Price!!;"I began my search for the perfect puppy food after finding out that Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet and other so-called ""Premium"" pet foods are basically the same junk as Kibbles 'n Bits, but with a premium price. My research led me to the Wellness brand, which is a great food but a bit on the pricey side."
4;Family gave it a thumbs up...;During the summer we do a lot of outdoor activities so this leaves little time for kitchen prep.  I cut chicken into chunks the night before we went to the zoo and upon returning home just threw them into the pan along with the included ingredients.
5;Fabulous for White Bread Only Kids;I was convinced by other reviewers to take a chance on this wheat pasta, and I'm sooooo glad I did. No one in my white-bread-only family noticed that it was wheat.
4;Best Energy Drink;This energy drink is great, no crash, taste good, and no calories. It is cheaper at some stores, but on amazon you get it delivered right to your door.
4;Typical Energy Drink;No Fear,Super Energy Supplement is your typical energy drink, and in my opinion tastes very similar to Red Bull. I tend to find all energy drinks taste the same though.
5;Very good value...;I've been purchasing K-Cups from Amazon for about 6 months now since I found the pricing to be cheaper than what I can get in the stores (even if I clip coupons and look for the sales.)  I was excited to see how cheap these were per cup when I first ran across the SF brand.
5;Better than decent tea blend, affordable, not top of the line;The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this line of teas, you are just a tiny little bit above the average 'value' curve.
5;An excellent product;These cranberries are excellent.  I make my own granola and I use them in that.
5;Loving the Lemon;I have never in my life written a review on any product until today. These cookies have compelled me to speak out! The Ginger Lemon is just great! The ginger is not over powering and the lemon is tart and sweet.
5;Superb Snack - but artificial flavor added;I am torn: 4 stars or 5 stars? I decided on 5 stars:<br /><br />- The taste is great! If you are Coke or Pepsi drinker, then they may not be sweet enough for you. I am not, hence I and my entire family enjoyed their subtle chocolaty flavor.
5;Great Conditioner, Nicely Packaged Design;Finally, a conditioner that does what it states.  This is one of a few I've used over the years that helps me avoid post shampoo and drying tangles and leaves my have manageable but not so heavy it looks fake.
4;Happy Hippo Cravings;My daughters tried their first Happy Hippos while visiting Spain. They have been obsessed ever since.
3;gritty pasty semi-tasty;NOTE: If you like this product and plan to use it, the quickest way to heat (and then properly store in a glass jar) is to put in the trunk of your car on a warm/hot day for a couple of hours..
5;Great doggie treat...;My dog has skin allergies and she can't have the usual treats with meat, turkey, etc.  This is an excellent treat for her when she is good.
5;Just like the theater!!!;Our whole family LOVES this popcorn!  It tastes just like the theater's!  When we first purchased our Lincoln Popper from Discount Tommy, I thought I would just make my own blend of salt, butter and other spices.  But I could never get it just right.
5;Raw food heaven;As a raw foodist I am always looking for foods that are both delicious and truly nourishing.  These wonderful flax crackers fill the bill.
5;Our pet loves greenies;Our pet loves having greenies as treat, she gets crazy every time she hears or see us opening the package. Her breath also gets better after eating her treat.
5;Best there is!;This is the main product that brings me back to Costco.<br />The tuna is superior quality and it's the only place where you can still buy 7oz cans.
1;Flavor additives -- not just tea!;"I was really excited to get this tea, as I'm totally addicted to cold-brewed iced tea and was looking forward to cutting out an overnight steeping of teabags and saving time.  However, when the tea arrived I discovered the ingredients weren't just ""tea"" -- they also had ""natural tea flavor"" and ""natural flavoring"" in each bag."
5;Very enjoyable;Both my 4 1/2 year daughter and I really enjoyed these cookies. I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter.
5;mmmm...;wow delicious and healthy??! i won't buy any other protein bar,these are simply excellent.  I also use the chocolate whey protein powder.
1;Broke;This did not last 15 seconds with our dog.  Chewed the piece that inserts into the bottle.
5;Fast service, generous supply, great tea.;My order was filled quickly and correctly. The tea is very good.
5;Great Coffee!;I think this is a little known brand of coffee, but it beats Senseo's  by a mile! I'm glad Senseo was on backorder - I was tempted to try The Pod. It's a very full-bodied coffee, but smooth.
5;Love the beans, love JR Mushrooms;I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded, followed up again with a nice response! How nice is that in this day and age!<br /><br />I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world. I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone.
5;Like no other earl grey;This is more than just Earl Grey, the flavor and the fragrance are intense. After this tea, the other brands are just bland.
3;Eh... its just ok.... creamy, no kick...;Well, its creamy but not bold..
4;Cats love it !;Cats are happy , so it must be good . The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I prefer cans over pouches because it's easier and less messier to handle the food .
5;Soft Oatmeal Yumminess;These things are great!  I don't like the granola-like crunchiness of most oatmeal bars, but these are soft.  No high fructose corn syrup or other unnatural, unhealthy stuff.
5;Delicious!;I was so excited to find these! The ones I received are about 2.5 inches in size and 120 calories two.
5;Finally--delicious GF baked goods!;The pancakes are so good I don't even mourn for the pre-diagnosis days--they're better than bisquick.  Also, I just followed the recipe on the bag for zucchini muffins and I can't believe how good they are.
5;Texture and taste;This is great baby food.  It has an interesting texture that our baby likes in her mouth, and she loves the taste.
4;A healthy alternative;I purchased these treats for my dogs after they experienced excessive weight gain from dog biscuit alternatives. This product has a much lower crude fat ratio than other biscuits, such as milk bones.
5;Best litter to date;I agree with all the comments about this litter being easier to scoop and dispose of in the toilet. I have four cats and I change the box out around every 2 weeks.
4;Two enthusiastic paws up;Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos.
5;Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee;I love these Starbuck's VIA packets. I'm one of those people who want a cup of coffee right after getting up and sometimes that's a problem when I travel.
5;Delightful, Tasty, Healthy Tea for Digestive Support...Superb!;*****<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation. It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor.
5;Cheeseball mix;This cheeseball mix is wonderful.  I was unable to purchase it locally and I found it was available on Amazon.
5;Refreshingly Delicious!;I love both the Lemonmint and Peppermint flavored water!  I was first introduced to this product at a Whole Foods market and loved it, but since I live 2 hours from the closest Whole Foods, I was delighted when I found it on Amazon.  This water is served best very cold and the flavor is cool and refreshing.
5;picky eater;I know this is a cat treat but my chihuahua that wont eat anything but human food devours this snack. My other chi loves it just as much but she will eat anything.
1;ewh;These cookies arrived in crumbles and tasted like wood. I understand now why they were such a good price.
5;great coffee;Green Mountain is a great blend of coffee.  It has a flavor that I like.
5;From an old coffee lover;The coffee I ordered was here in less than a week after I placed the order. The packaging was excellent.
5;Tried them all... Best Sugar Substitute;My husband bought some of this sugar substitute at Whole Foods a while back and now we are hooked!! This even beats Stevia/Truvia as a sugar substitute. I have also used this to bake with and it works almost as well as real sugar.
5;yummy;Great if you pan fry these with braggs amino liquid. double yummy! great taste, good expiration date.
5;Great Hot cereal!;Full of good health goodies! Lots of fiber, omega-3, flaxseed. Cooks fast.
5;Dog loves them;We bought our dog both the turkey flavor and the salmon flavor.  She seems to enjoy the salmon flavor much more but does like the turkey as well.
5;good tasty treat;My 11 month old daughter loves these. Not only is the taste great, the texture is really soothing to her gums.
5;One of the Most Delicious Teas I've tasted!;This is a great tea. It brews up so fragrantly and the taste is so clean.
4;Pretty Good;As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.
5;Great product..;This pepper has great flavor to put on any meat, fish, vegetable or pasta and potatoes. Love the flavor.
5;They're Good. Fresh and Tasty.;Hmmmm. I read somewhere that a little dark chocolate is now good for you.
4;Scott's fudge balls;These were delicious, but not wrapped as well as I think they should be.  They kind of melted out of their wrapping.
4;Good little variety pack for vegetarians.;I am a vegetarian and a fan of indian food, so I decided to try this sample pack of Kitchens of India food products. I find it difficult to come across a deal that involves all vegetarian friendly foods, and so I purchased this when it was in the Daily Deals section.
5;So far so good;We have a year old bullmastiff and have tried Iams which she would eat but wasn't too crazy about. We decided to go with Wellness, a little pricey but well worth it.
2;missing everything but the tree;I received the tree in a timely manner, and it was in a fine condition. However, besides the typed instructions and the ceramic pot housing the tree, none of the listed items were received.
5;Amazon helps me celebrate winter;"When winter rolls around it is cider and cocoa time. Even though winter was very light this year my craving for apple cider did not diminish and is a ""must have"" for me."
5;Wonderful for conditioning and moisturizing the hair and scalp;I use this product on my hair and scalp and it is a great conditioner. It is very light and absorbs quickly in my hair and scalp.
5;Dog goes bananas for these;Sorry for the pun but my pup really loves these things. They're obviously more expensive than regular treats, but they are definitely higher quality.
5;Tastes great, really sweet;The instructions state to add one packet to 8oz of water. Since my bottled water is 20oz, I removed enough water to fit the powder, and mixed it in.
5;Delicous!;Love this stuff! Gives a unique flavor to lamb or vegetable stews. Use less than you think you'll need - this is potent.
5;Yummy Dressing;It is almost impossible to find this dressing in the stores anymore!  It is so good and is delightful on a salad made with lettuce, Romano cheese, almond, and sesame seeds - a recipe that was used at a popular restaurant in my area that is now closed.  Try it.
5;Almost $4 a bag & messy. So why do I give it 5 stars?;Taste. A very natural taste.
5;Dodger Loves It!;On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.
5;Yummy;Shipped quickly.  The candy was fresh and tasted great.
1;If you love your pet don't buy!;"Fed to dog and she got violently sick and vomited the whole this up after eating it. Don't buy this product if you love your pet!!<a href=""http://www."
5;G.W.J.;I have been making wine kits since 2004 at the rate of 1 kit per week. I have been buying mostly the Wine Expert/Vintners Reserve kit.
5;Splendid Surprise!;I had this on my shelf unopened for several months, picked up on a whim and forgotten until snowstorm food became boring. By itself on lettuce, arugula, green beans, sprinkled on the Rancho Gordo heirloom beans.
5;Good Product - Nice Taste;I purchased this coffee flavor (Hazelnut) for my wife and she is really enjoying it.  Only problem is when we received the box, all k-cups were packed inside the box and a couple of k-cup were punctured.
4;I enjoyed it;Overall, I found Switch Kiwi Berry to be tasty.  I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.
4;Have a bit of sweetener after taste;Pretty unique.  There's no filter inside.
5;Best non-whey non-soy alternative;Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.
5;Great;Received a Senseo coffee maker several Christmases ago. Settled on the medium roast and have enjoyed it ever since.
4;Gluten Free nature Valley roasted Nut Crunch Bars;I was very skeptical about this product, it was like peanut brittle, kind of hard.  I was expecting something soft like mose Nature Valley bars.
2;PASKESZ APPLE CHIPS;I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE APPLE CHIPS.  I HAVE PURCHASED SENECA APPLE CHIPS IN THE PAST--I REALLY LOVED THEM.
5;Yum!;I LOVE pop chips!  I like salty snacks and having one this low calorie is great.  I did think that the single serve bags of salt and vinegar has less flavor than the bigger bags, so I think next time I buy in bulk I'll get the bigger bags.
4;Excellent snack;I could not get this brand of jerky in local markets. They are delicious and I am glad Amazon carries it.
5;I think it's great!;Made it without the oil, only cuz there was none in the house..
5;Best cat food;I started buying Wellness cat food after my vet recommended it. I've been using it ever since.
5;Perfect in every category and delicious!!  Highly recommend!;I've tried them all, literally.  I came across this drink completely by accident while I was at Whole Foods.
5;Just about my favorite K-Cup coffee so far;Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee.
3;Low Carb Snack, High Sodium;I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty.
5;Beautiful, big bouquet;I ordered this bouquet for my Mother-in-Law as a late Mother's day present. It arrived on the day I selected, which also happened to be the day she had been in a car accident.
5;Fantastic Coffee;This is some great coffee,been drinking this for past 5 years. I never get tired of having it, even with heat wave I still enjoyed the flavor.
4;Almost as good as vanilla - 90%;"I asked a barista at a local java shop what kind of Chai they had behind the counter.  He said ""Big Train"", I've been buying it ever since."
4;Bob's Quinoa;Decent product, it takes little longer to cook than it says on package. Stir it often.
5;Awesome tea;Stash tea is a fantastic flavorful tea and I particularly like Earl Grey.  The decaf is a little hard to find at times but Amazon has it for a great price if you buy in bulk.
3;Good snack, but a bit hard on the tummy...;This is good snack that is easy to bring along. Great container too - love the screw-on lid! However, the pepper taste is quite strong, so be warned that if you easily get an upset stomach or deal with heartburn, this is not the snack for you.
5;Good treat at a good price;I bought these at a pet store prior to amazon and paid probably double the amount ($6 something). My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside.
5;Excellent product;Very tasty add-on to your popcorn! What is really nice about this is that it gives you several different flavor choices and you can easily get to them.  Well designed packaging.
5;Awesome Tea;I've always liked hot tea but this is by far the best I've ever had.  I've shared it with others & now they too are hooked.
5;organic dog food;Human-grade chicken, all organic dog food.  The food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the Subscribe & Save program.
5;Da Bomb!;My daughter gobbles these puffs up like they're manna from heaven..
5;Good taste and bold;This is the first time I tried this flavor. It's bold and strong.
5;Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!;The heading says it all. Crisp and fresh packs of cookies well packed for transit and quickly delivered.
5;Rosie's favorite treat;My dog looks forward to her chicken topper treat every evening.  It seems to calm her down knowing she must have been a good dog during the day to get such a great treat.
5;Usually love this product but not this time;We always order organic shelled hemp seeds from Nutiva and we love them but the last order we received was horrible.  There were a ton of shells mixed in with the product which made it very bitter and hard to eat.
5;Great for short time energy;Great for long drives when you are tired or just need that little extra something to help you wake up.<br />The Pomegranate taste is better than the others also.
5;Other Review Dishonest;The other review (entitled 'Fruit and Branch Mangler) is dishonest. The reviewer wrote negative things about ALL the fruit pickers except his.
5;Great value, great product.;I'm not quite ready to fully switch my dog to this, but at this price you really need to give it a try. Our regular feed is Halo which costs around $3 per pound.
5;our daughter loves these gummy bears;Our two year old loves these gummy bears.  I feel less guilty about giving these to her since they're all natural.
1;"Spoiled long before ""Best By"" date";One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.
5;Very healthy for your babies - different texture;
3;darjeeling;well..
5;love it!;I eat several Kashi foods and I love this one.  It has got to be hands down one of my favorites!  The cinnamon taste isn't overbearing like in kids cereals, and the past several months I've even swithced my kids over to Kashi.
2;Not as expected;These came out smaller than I expected, but the taste as not as good as I thought it should be.  Second time, I added a couple of items, which helped a little, but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix.
4;great but dogs get tired of it;This is one of the only foods that our border collie has been successful with in terms of allergies and other unwanted side effects of various other high quality grain free foods. We have tried many things but always come back to Sojos.
1;Shortchanged...;I fell in love with Fisher peanuts when I was flying Korean Airline.  i bought this due to the container version doesn't seems to taste as good as the one I had on airplane.
5;Nature's Burger - I love it;One day over 20 years ago I detected a wonderful smell in my kitchen and it turned out to be some Nature's Burger mix + water being prepared by one of my house mates. He was letting it soak in preparation for frying.
5;Great ghee, good size;I use ghee a lot for cooking (couscous, frying fish, etc.) instead of butter.
5;Delicious way to start the day;We had this tea in a restaurant and loved it. I inadvertantly bought a pound of the loose tea, thinking I had bought 100 tea bags.
5;Great popcorn! Just like the movies!;I have been searching to find that perfect movie theater popcorn that I can make at home
5;"Asta the Westie says, ""Five Barks!""";The Three Muske-Terriers, a male Westie, a male Cesky and the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty are always on the lookout for tasty, healthy treats, (well, as for healthy, that's really more mom and dad's concern). This can be tricky.
1;Holy Creepy Crawlers and No Trapping;Let me start by saying I don't normally write reviews and I buy almost everything via Amazon so I am compelled on this one. Ok so I have my nice flat panel tv mounted to a brick wall in the house we just moved into.
5;Senses Surprised!;My senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew.<br />I substituted this bean when Amazon dropped Starbucks Sumatra from their Subscribe & Save program.
5;Beautiful Taste;I am hypo-glycemic and definitely addicted to sugar.  I have really enjoyed using this in my tea, pies, everywhere that sugars is required.
5;absolutely delicious;i love apple cider, but this was genious to put the caramel with it.  it melts in your mouth & is a warm comforting beverage.
1;ewwwwww;We use instant mashed potatoes a lot but these - I'm not sure what these are. The taste is horrible.
5;Don't run out of this cat food!;My cats love this food!  After doing much research, Weruva appears to be a very high quality food.  And judging their good health ever since starting on this food, it appears to be true.
5;First time, I dig it.;I decided to switch to green tea instead of drinking soda every day. I knew I would miss the sweetness of sugar, so I picked this up to add to my tea.
5;LOVE them but do not buy if you are looking for something sweet!;I LOVE dark chocolate almost the point of eating unsweetened cocoa.  That being said, I love these bars.
5;Awesome bars!!;These are dairy free, which is a very good thing in our house.  They are so good, almost like dessert (think Mounds candy bar).
4;Does the Job;"Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon Cubes provide chicken flavoring for vegetarians and vegans who do not want the ""real"" thing.  The flavor is excellent."
2;Poor Quality;I bought this product from Target after I had done what I thought was enough research on baby food makers.  I was originally going to get the baby bullet, but the reviews were not good at all so I went with the brezza instead.
1;One week from expiration date;No aroma and tasted like cigarette ash. I think the beans were rancid when I received them since they were so close to the expiration date.
4;Great toy!;My 6 year old puppy LOVES this toy!  She is a crazy Sheppard mix, 60 pounds and full of energy.  I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds.
5;great product, great price;I purchased this canned pumpkin to have a ready supply of it for some low cal, weight watchers type desserts that I like to make in the fall and winter..
5;Best Loganberry Jam;This Jam is about the best Loganberry I have found in recent years. Loganberry Jam is very hard to find in retail stores.
5;Best Olive Oil Ever;I was exposed to this product while working in a restaurant. The Chef recomended it.
5;Jet Fuel;This is fantastic coffee..
1;organic mommy;I really want to love this product.  First of all, the advertisement is wrong.
5;More for your money!!;I purchased these treats (packaged as cat treats) in a small bag at a high-end pet store.  I give them to my kitties when I call them to come in (thereby ensuring that they always come when I call) and they love them.
1;Have Some Crumbs!;This product tastes okay, but the packaging is ridiculous.  Three hundred 2-cracker cellophane packs were literally thrown into one, big box, with no padding, no partitions, and no expiration dates.
4;Well worth it, if you can control yourself;These are great tasting dried mangoes.  They're tender, don't taste too sweet, and have a nice texture.
5;reason for recall;"According to the FDA, the reason for the recall was:<br />""The firm decided to recall the wheat flour products they repack that do not declare ""wheat"" on the finished product labels."" ([."
5;Great meat replacement;Since the new year, I am on a lifestyle change. Use this to reduce overall fat in your diet.
5;Oh yes.  This is the stuff!;Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, two 10-Ounce Packages.  Arrived today and this is what I was after.
5;Sweet and natural tasting;I have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite.  It is sweet, but naturally so.
3;Gross;I found wrapping  my tiny tot's pills in a little ball of wet dog food was simple and seemed more palatable than the greasy, foul smelling greasies oops I mean greenies.  He used to toss them around but hesitated to eat them for ages until I became concerned.
4;I love this Candy!;I found this in chinatown next to the White Rabbit candy and thought I'd<br />give it a try. Wow! I love it and so do my co-workers.
3;Not my favorite flavor;I love Erin's Breakfast Cookies, but this flavor is a little to rich for me.  It gives me that funny feeling in the back of my throat.
5;Dogs Love It;I've been buying this product for over 10 yrs.  It is a special<br />treat and reward for our dogs - I will continue buying this.
4;A Subtle, Not Too Sweet Flavor;If you don't like your gummies too sweet, these might be for you -but beware the raspberry flavor isn't very intense either.  They have a nice soft texture and a decent overall flavor:  I would order them again if there weren't any better options out there.
5;Happy dogs (but rather horrid smell);We have two twenty pound dogs, and they love these.  Other reviews complained about the thickness, but these were much thicker than the ones we've purchased from the local pet store and the grocery.
4;WAKE UP TO VANILLA COFFEE;I have to say that although I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee since I find it too strong and sometimes having a burnt taste, I was pleasantly surprised with this vanilla flavored coffee, even though I don't normally care for a vanilla flavor in my coffee. I found both the vanilla scent and the flavor pretty natural and I would recommend it if you like flavored coffees, especially flavored with vanilla.
1;Salt Extreme;When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt.
3;An acquired taste;This snack is an acquired taste and I just couldnt get my taste buds to enjoy them.  I will not purchase them again.
5;Excellent Quality;I don't normally use honey but I drink a fair amount of tea and wanted something healthier than white sugar or products like Splenda, etc.<br /><br />Just got two one pound jars of Really Raw Honey and I must say it's much nicer than what I'm used to at the local grocery store.
1;This milk tastes sour;My son and I both tasted this milk and it was terribly sour. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what.
1;Fish tea;I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too.
5;one of the most important minerals for asthmatics;I've been taking this for over a year before going to bed and have not had any problems going to sleep or staying asleep at night since I've started taking it.  According to the experts, it's one of the most important minerals for asthmatics to take because it relaxes the bronchial tube muscles hence either eliminating or reducing bronchial tightness/restriction.
5;Fresh Tapioca;Bob's tapioca is great! Fresh and at a great price. One problem was that Amazon said this was free shipping.
5;All the cats love this;Went to vets today to pick up some stuff and saw these treats.  Figured I'd give them a try.
5;quite tasty!;there are a variety of ginseng coffee packets out in the market, and basically they all taste quite good.  the difference between gold choice and other brands, is gold choice lists instant coffee and ginseng as the first two ingredients and sugar last.
5;FANTASTIC FLAVOR;This is the best meat rub I have ever used!  The maple undertone really adds a taste never experienced before and a small amount on both sides is all that is needed.  It really helps hold in the moisture too.
5;Amazing Honey;Amazing honey!  Smooth texture and nice, light flavor.  A GREAT find!  Try it.
5;Great peppers and hot.;Maybe I just got a good batch, but the heaping pound of peppers I received are extremely hot, hottest I've ever tasted, and make amazing chili powder too.<br /><br />There is also a strong smoky, mesquite, jerky, sweet flavor to go along with them.
4;Good tasting cereal;Tastes good, though somewhat sugary. Good to snack on, occasionally.
5;Great Dates!;I just wolfed down 4 of these delicious dates. I love dates and these are as good as any I've ever had.
5;Excellent orange aroma.;i don't know why one reviewer said the orange flavor was overpowering.  i find it has an excellent taste and nice orange aroma.
5;Soooooooooo good !;I love this seasoning.  I tried it at a local movie theater, and was wowed by it.
5;A Must for Any Cook;When you need just a little it's always there without the worry of opening a can and having to throw it out because you cannot use it all. It takes me 2 to 3 weeks sometimes longer to use a whole tube.
5;Fantastic quality!;The basket was delivered very quickly! The site was user-friendly and the basket was exactly as pictured. It came wrapped in celephane paper, tied with a 2-inch cloth-like bow.
5;Really good jerky!;The jerky was as described. It had a good taste and will be ordering more.
5;Yumm!;I have bought and tried  lots of different chai tea brands: Tazo, Oregan chai, local shops etc. Tried this at a local shop and asked them the name of their chai as it was creamy and not overtly sweet and not too 'chai-ish' ( I know that isn't a word! ) When I looked it up on the Big Train website and was disappointed as I found they did not sell to the general public.
5;Big Bones for Big Dog;"Ordered several 22"" to 24"" rawhide bones for my dag for the holidays and shipment was prompt.."
5;My very favorite coffee!;This is my favorite coffee in the whole world!  I have had a Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine for almost five years (a gift from my husband which I thought a foolish extravagance at the time).  To do it justice, I tried many different coffees, read a book about coffee beans and coffee types, experimented with specialty coffees and coffee drinks.
5;A classic FAVORITE.;Zots also known as the classic favorite fizzy candy are soooo Delicious. definitely worth the price and You will LOVE them.
5;Both my dog and cat liked this;My dog will eat anything, but my cat is really picky. Up until now, the only treat he would even look at was bonito flakes.
5;GREAT TASTING CHIPS;This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags.
4;This stuff works!!!;The energy shot truly does work! It had a terrible after-taste at first, but now that I know what to expect, I am getting used to it. I always have some water handy as a chaser.
1;Poor Substitute;I had previously ordered the single bully sticks and they were no longer available.  It was suggested I get the braided.
5;Best cinnamon tea ever;Had this for the first time on an Alaskan Cruise.  Ordered some as soon as I got home.
4;product makes good cola drinks;I bought this to try and make the cola drink like Borders Book store sells and it is close.  Maybe I just need more practice at making it.
3;Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea;***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas.
5;Arrowhead Flaxseed;I have tried other brands and found the seeds filled with debris.  A lot of stalks, leaf bits, etc.
5;Can't find this cereal anywhere except Amazon;Both my kids and I love this cereal but can't find it in any stores except Amazon. It's a little on the sweet side, but other than that it's delicious.
1;Not That Good;Not very good at any price. You can find better cookies baked by your local grocery store in their clear plastic container.
5;Does the job;Good product!  I'm not a baking soda connoiseur, so I can't tell the difference between this and arm and hammer.  But it definitely minimizes odor's in my son's diaper pail, and I like that it doesn't have aluminum in it.
4;Amazon verified Purchase;A product I've used for about 10 years and continue to think highly of. It mixes easily and throughly, does not clump in my water bottle and has a refreshing taste.
5;Excellent taste;
5;The perfect treat!;These things are unbelievably good and satisfy so many cravings all at once.<br /><br />First - they are crunchy, so if you have a need for a snack with crunch, this is perfect.
5;best find ever!!!;I was in the Berkshires doing the fall foliage trip and stopped in a small grocery type deli for sandwiches<br />when I saw Hollys Au Natural Porridge boxes on the shelve and they said Gluten Free. I immediately picked up a box<br />and took it with me to my next destination where I had a kitchen to cook it in.
5;"Yummy, and ""more healthier"" as my kids would say";We love these!<br /><br />Beware, though, the warehouse is sending out the wrong amount.  You should get 3.
3;Not as good as Tazo;I bought this tea because my husband loves the double bergamot from Stash. I'd been drinking Tazo brand, and I have to admit that Tazo is quite a bit better.
5;Fantastic Fudge!;This is some of the very best fudge.  They also make WONDERFUL truffles.
5;Utterly marvelous -- best of the Sahale nut snacks;"These match the excellent quality of the same product from a local store, as do the ""Soledad"" almonds.  It is difficult to keep from eating the whole pricey bag at one sitting."
2;I'm not impressed;I drank two cups of each flavor, coming to the conclusion that this is unremarkable tea.  You can barely tell the difference between flavors.
1;Does Not Want!;"My Shiba Inu (who already is somewhat picky) usually goes for the regular Dingo knots, so I though something with a little extra beef would be a plus. The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was a very strong ""smoky"" smell."
3;not bad but not enough zing;This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.
1;Hard as can be.;Taste like I am chewing on glass. Hard and I am afraid I am going to break a tooth.
5;If you're looking, you're already buying;What can I say about this item that you don't already know?  These things are just..
5;Great Jerky;I love Jerky. I use to order it on eBay and other sellers mainly from Seattle.
5;My twins love these little pouches!;We love these little pouches.  They're portable and this particular meal does well at room temp.
5;So much better than wilton;I bought the Wilton edible markers first and returned them immediately because they just didn't work.  I was trying to put details on cake pop (candy melt surface) and the Wilton pens just poked holes and didn't leave any ink behind unless you pushed really hard.
5;C.S. Mandarin Spice from Amazon;This was a very good tasting tea! I really do enjoy all of Celestial Seasonings Teas.  I will be purchasing more of the same thing soon.
3;Good flavor but very expensive;This is good beef jerky.  Keep in mind however that you paying almost $15 for 3.
5;Tea British, Me British equals Happy;I am British and personally I cannot stand Lipton tea for hot tea. Ice tea sure hot no way.
1;now come on now;This is good cocoa..
5;Great value;My dog LOVES these treats. They tend to have a very strong fish oil smell.
5;Great tasting coffee.;The coffee I ordered is great.  If you want a sweet coffee this is for you.
5;totally agree, it is restaurant quality!  SUPER!!!!;believe all the 5-star reviews, this broth is restaurant quality..
5;Good beans!;Very satisfied with this city roast (espresso roast)! The beans make a great cup of latte and americano, not sure how it taste as a shot as I don't drink straight espresso. The one thing that stands out with these beans to me is the fact that the coffee doesn't go sour after it's been in your cup for awhile.
5;Good, but strong toasted coconut flavor;"This are very good. I was a little surprised by how strong the toasted coconut flavor was since it isn't included in the ""flavor"" of the bar."
5;Good cookie, good price;Some find the orange taste too strong. I don't.
5;Great extreme hot sauce;I love Dave's Ghost Pepper hot sauce.<br /><br />Most of the time when I make chili, I make myself an extremely hot pot of chili which involves adding at at least a dozen serranos and habaneros.
5;Good product the second time around;I ordered regular Calm, and received Calm Plus Calcium.  These are different products.
5;Great filling;I have tried this filling years ago and could not get it at our small town for years.  I am thrilled I can order it online.
4;Smells like real food!  But watch out for the peas if your dog has allergies;My dog loved this food, and he lost a few pounds without seeming to be ravenous all the time.  I'm so impressed with the high quality ingredients, but I'm still searching.
2;Few bite size pieces left when I received it;I thought this was a great deal when I purchased this item a few weeks ago. So far, I have opened 2 out of the 5 boxes and more than half of the cereal is crushed and not edible (unless you like it that way).
5;The thrill of the Pill (Pockets);Pill Pockets may be the best product of any kind I've ever bought, including my first WalkMan. After months of jamming two pills down my poor cat's throat, I learned about Pill Pockets and thought I'd give them a try.
5;Yummy snacks;I think that the Kind Bars are really tasty, especially the Almond & Coconut.  They are quite filling although addictive.
5;great coffee;When we bought our Keurig it came with an assortment of coffee's. This one was by far our favorite.
5;Delicately, Deliciously White;Before reviewing this product, some background about white tea might be helpful. I've been a serious student of tea for a few years now, so my intention is not to be pompous but rather to share what I've learned so that you can enjoy your tea to its fullest potential.
4;Pretty good taste;
1;Manure;The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE: SMG) is the world's leading marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products. The publicly traded company has donated $200,000 to the Restore Our Future super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
4;Very Good;I really liked this coffee
1;Delicious chocolate. IF they weren't damaged/crushed;if you like your carmello bar to be messy and leaky with the outer chocolate shell broken, squished, or just damaged beyond recognition, then this is the product for you. i have gone through 15 bars so far.
4;A cat chooses the litter;Different cats like different litter sometimes.  The vet told me that even though some litters are better, it may be hard/painful on the cat's feet, causing them Not to use the litterbox at all OR to not cover their poop.
5;Love, Love, LOVE this oatmeal;Love, Love, LOVE this oatmeal.  Really.
3;I like this shampoo OK - but find the smell too strong;"This shampoo is OK and it doesn't bother me that it doesn't ""tingle"" as other reviewers have stated.  What's all this desire for tingling anyway?  Your fingers tingle and you worry you have a medical problem, but oh if your head tingles, you think your dandruff shampoo is working?  I even googled tingling dandruff shampoo as I thought I had read somewhere that the tingle is actually caused by an ingredient that has nothing to do with the anti-dandruff properties of other shampoos."
5;I drink this for arthritis pain...;..
5;Scrum-a-lum for Scarpetta!;We found this on a shelf in Whole Foods, Palo Alto, CA.  Made in Somerville, MA, we wanted to support my home state and purchased this.
5;goldensrule;Our nine year old, very active, Golden Retriever loves these treats.  We cut several of them up into bite-size pieces and add them to her twice daily meals.
5;Love it;Healthy,excellant taste. I'm sure kids would love it also
3;Merlin's review;My dog ate the treat, but was not as excited about it as he is with his other treats. Please note that this is a LARGE piece, and may not be suitable for small to medium dogs.
5;My Sheltie absolutely loves Zukes;My dog goes crazy for Zukes mini naturals. And I am very pleased with Zukes because the treats are made in the United States with healthy ingredients.
5;Great, natural product;Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients.
2;Baneful Healthy Weight Dry Dog Food;I normally purchase this for my dogs.  This time I ordered through Amazon for convenience, but it is too expensive so I will have to purchase at my local store from now on.
5;Great flavor;I really like the flavor of this tea. It actually makes me feel better.
4;Works for multi-cat families (Chicken Flavor);If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.
5;THE preferred noodle of the Bering sea fleet;Hands down, Nong Shim produces a quick snack/meal. After working aboard vessels on the Bering for 12 years I've come to the conclusion that this little bowl has become the epitome for a meal if you don't have time, want to pass on the food offered in the Galley or trying to survive during the down time when the catch has run dry and boredom sets in causing the munchies.
5;Great product;I used buy kefir from the grocery store or make it from kefir powder starter.  I read about kefir grains and wow, what a difference making kefir with them makes.
5;Really great pasta;"I just started GF eating and was disapointed with the rice pasta, eatable but not great. I tried this, ""duck shaped"" for kids that I found at a local health food store."
5;awesome;I ordered these after being given a similar candy called angel mints.  These are a bit different, but they are delicious.
5;Best Chai Tea;Best Chai Tea available.  Can't find it in our local supermarkets.
5;Quality and taste;This really is the best tuna on the market, hard to find tuna like this in stores and really hard to find tuna in olive oil.  Great for sandwiches and salads but really hard to beat the quality and comparing to the specialty store in my area that sells at twice the price this is a value.
5;Double Earl Rocks!!!!!;I have tried many brands of Earl Gray tea and  Stash is by far the best. I enjoy several cups a day.
3;Pretty Good;These muffins are good. Not awesome, but OK.
3;I love HappyBaby products, just not *this* one.;The banana flavor is by far better tasting than the greens or apple flavor. My baby would rather eat Cheerios, unfortunately.
5;Mug is Great, needs more color choices;This mug is great. It's very practical, works well, and seems sufficiently durable to last long enough for me to get decent value out of it.
5;Clif never lets me down;This crunch granola bar is on par with every other product from Clif.  It is, as the name would imply, very crunch and extremely delicious.
5;Yum Yum;This pack is a fantastic price for organic food and great for parents who are just starting solids.  I love the fact that it took all the guess work out of what to feed.
5;Delicious!;I first tasted this olive oil while visiting Las Vegas, at an Italian restaurant. I bought a can and brought it home with me, as we were driving.
5;Hot!;I eat alot of spicy food, and I had a small taste of this straight and it is pretty hot!!!<br />It has a very distinct aroma and taste. It is a very tasty sauce, but so hot! I mixed between a quarter and a half of the bottle into a 1 litre much milder chili sauce.
1;Extremely foul taste!;The first split second after popping one of these in to my mouth wasn't so bad. Then reality set in.
5;Recommended by herbalist--love it.;We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.
5;Turned her teeth around;When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better.
3;electric fence charger;this one is Ok, but I can not tell if it is working properly unless I touch it or get the volt meter..
5;Soda Stream Mix;Great product - it tastes like the real thing!  I would recommend this product to my family and friends.  Great delivery service.
5;MMMMM-Amazing!;I was in a store which sold odd ball food items from various countries and came across this truffle salt. I have heard before of the truffles high prices and good tastes, but there was no way I wanted to pay 30 dollars for a 3.
5;Ginkgo tea for your brain!;It really works. Better than caffeine for a late afternoon brain pick-up or even a morning wakeup call.
5;gerber barley cereal - very healthy choice for a baby;Healthy choice for my baby, very convenient package, easy to prepare, my baby loves it, no added milk or fruit, which may either spoil the real taste of the product, or cause allergic reaction. Best choice for busy parents.
5;Best coffee maker you can buy;This is my second Saeco coffee maker in 8 years..
5;Great Prices!;I orderd these lollipops for my daughter's birthday party. By far the best prices I could find and everyone said they were delicious.
5;crepe mertyle bonsai;plant arrived in good shape. within 1 week all leaves fell off.
4;INSTANT SUMMER;"A very good blend of iced tea and lemonade.  For those of you who enjoy an ""Arnold Palmer"" in the warmer months, this is pertfect for you!  Add lots of ice and brew in the 8 oz."
5;Waaaay better than OK!;It took a long time, and several tries, to find the right hazelnut decaf k-cup. And this is IT.
5;Wow!!!!! Hot, Hot, Hot... But Very Good Stuff.;This stuff has a bite to it, so start with a little and adjust from there.<br />We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it, and WOW!!!!! burn your lips off hot.
4;Good for snacking;The granola itself is fairly unsweet but the abundant semi-sweet chocolate chunks provide an overall appropriate sweetness and a chocolate flavor that is not overpowering.  I'm not into chocolate cereal, so I didn't try it with milk, but it quickly disappeared as a snack when left on the counter (I didn't even get to finish it).
5;Love Em;Best Protein Bars I have found. Ordered them once and trying to do so again and I can't.
5;Tasty!;"This is the best K-cup tea I've found so far. It tastes very good and doesn't use the word ""exotic"" to add random spices that are not necessary."
5;Great tasting!! Two thumbs up from a pregnant lady!;I am pregnant and was getting charley horses, and a friend recommended that I look into coconut water. Each bottle has more potassium then a banana--which sounded great to me since I hate bananas! I ordered a case of the chocolate flavor, since I had heard regular coconut water is not too good.
4;Not bad...;I don't suppose peas, carrots, wheat and corn are part of a dog's natural diet, but this is dried dog food and I guess we can't complain about fillers otherwise we'd be feeding them meat from the butchers or canned dog food. Having said that, my dog chows (pun intended) this down just like any other and has no complaints.
4;Good pretzel, if slightly sweet.;The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).
4;Great Present for Nostalgics;When I bought this product I was concerned that it contained just a few candy items. Not the case! The amount you see in the image is probably not even a good representation of what you're getting.
3;Not great, not bad;I purchased this tea because I was drinking 4 or more cups/day. It was not particularly smooth, or very flavorful.
5;Excellent Ginger Tea;I recently gave up coffee, but still felt I needed a little boost first thing in the morning.  The nice spicy ginger tea is great for waking me up and love the lemon-ginger flavor.
5;Superb!;I am very familiar with Rishi teas, though I'd never before sampled their Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea. This is one of the best white teas I've ever tried, and I've tried quite a few.
2;Great product, higher priced than local stores!;Firstly, I've used this product with both my younger sons and have never had any problems with it.  We started it on the advice of our pediatrician to use as a supplement because he suspected my son had acid reflux and it worked as a charm!<br /><br />Secondly, I find that the smaller containers are better since you are meant to finish it within I think a week after opening, which means that you are better off with the smaller container, depending on how much your child eats obviously, but even price-wise it's smarter.
5;Liquid Love!;I love Chai and Zhena's is the BEST!  I happened upon Zhena's coconut chai in my local grocery store but they only stocked it for a short time so I was pleased to find it here!  Add a splash of vanilla almond milk to this and you'll be in heaven!  Want something even more yummy?  Use a little whipper to froth it up and it's better than desert!  Oh, and I'm glad I bought this when I did because it was only $7.15 when I snapped it up a few days ago!  Be sure to compare prices at Zhena's Gypsy tea site [.
5;No Better Cornbread.  Period;I found this product originally at Williams Sonoma and realized my quest for the perfect cornbread was finally over.  I'm a baker and have never found a recipe or a mix that makes the truly delicious cornbread I dreamed of.
4;Smells good;And tastes yummy when you fry plantains with it. I had a bad sunburn last year on my shoulders.
5;Very much like this tea;Great hot and iced, pleasant taste. Highly recommend.
5;Excellent!;I sent this to my son and his room-mate at OSU.  They were both very, very pleased.
5;Great!;My scalp gets dry because I shampoo a lot and this product really helps to reverse the damage.  It feels like it goes deep and lasts a long time.
1;Yeast Extract = MSG, They DO Contain Preservatives!;"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that."
5;Great buy.;This is really good tuna. The quality is good and the flavor is exceptional.
5;Pill pockets;This is a great product.  For years even when I hide a pill in food, my dog would eat the food and spit out the pill.
5;Rosa's Fudge;Rosa's Fudge is over the top good.  I found them a few years ago at our local 7-11.
5;Love these and Great Seller;I have ordered these several times and they always come in a timely manner and they are the real candy. I will order again.
5;Excellent tasting Chai Tea;This is the best tasting Chai tea I've had. It is spicy and full of flavor.
3;Good Variety.....;The Farley's Chewy Mix had several awesome candies, however, several of the pieces were sticky and the paper was coming off..
5;Best Gluten Free Pasta Ever;I have tried many gluten-free pastas and they are pretty much horrible. And expensive.
5;Great;I have tried many brands and types of tea and this is one of the best. It has a very spicy taste and is refreshing.
5;Box-o-Chips;These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.
3;Sweet without being overwhelmingly so;I purchased a cannister of this with a little trepidation. I'm rather picky about sweet teas, since as a Southern girl my idea of sweet tea can be pretty specific.
5;The Best Keurig K-Cup Coffee I've Found So Far;Tully's French Roast K-Cups make the best coffee I've so far tasted from a Keurig Coffee Maker.  There are many good coffees out there, but to my taste the French Roast has the kick I need.
4;Caribou daybreak coffee;Great coffee, wish we could get it in larger packs.It's not too strong,doesn't have any burnt taste, and not bitter.
1;Too Salty and Too Peppery Cashews;Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews were quite a disappointment.  The cashews are rather small and a bit broken up (which could have been from the shipping) although they seem to be of good quality.
5;Great Breakfast option.;I have used Carnation Instant Breakfast Sugarfree  before and love it for a quick satisfying breakfast.  It is very difficult to find anything other than the SF chocolate in a canister so it's was nice to order a quanity of the variety pack from Amazon.
5;Crystal Light Stberry Kiwi sugar free drink At Amazon;This product is great tasting and easy to make.<br />It used to be on store shelves, but for some reason it is not, anymore.
5;Love these and they are gluten free;These are my very favorite crackers and savory snack at the moment.  They are gluten free, which is important for any Celiacs out there.
4;Convenient delivery of a necessity!;Dear son has had to be on soy formula since we discovered milk products were irritating his bowels. Prosobee has worked for us since dear son was a newborn, and I see no reason to switch now.
5;Tasty but needs some TLC;I have to say that I have brewed for Coopers Kits at this point and this is most likely the best..
5;Smells like real food;My two cat enoy this canned food.  They come running as I get it out of the cabinet.
5;Awesome taste, very like the ice cream;I loved the flavor and the fact that it was so long lasting. Everyone in the office eats it now.
3;Torn;Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.
5;YUMMY!!!;I got these to give as a gift. The person flipped for them and I believe has re-ordered for themselves.
1;Made in America;Don't be misled like I was. It looks like this is from Ireland, as it even talks of using Irish milk on this page.
3;Terra Tomato Chips;These chips are not as good as the other Terra products I have tried.  They are too spicy to taste anything but spice and they also have a shape and texture that are not very good.
5;Excellent Flavor;A coworker told me I should try Community Coffee so I purchased a bag at a local supermarket.  The taste of the coffee  in conjunction with our Bunn coffee macihine is outstanding.
2;not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys;as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats.
2;Not very good;I wish I could give this coffee a positive review, as Papua New Guinea coffee is not always easy to find. But this was not very good.
5;Excellent dried apples;These dried apples are very good. They are crispy not chewy.
1;San Francisco Bay Rain Forest Keurig coffee;I found this coffee too bitter and strong.  It was described as mild but I did not find it so.
4;4 experiments, 4 different tastes;I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning.
5;Wife likes this;Bought it for the wife, she loves it.  Great deal for k-cups.
5;One of my best purchases ever.  A near lifetime supply.;Nearly 15 years ago, I bought one of these cases.  Even though I partake in Sen-sen regularly, it takes weeks to get through one of the packets.
5;Great Space Saver;This K-cup storage is stylish & space saving. K-cups are easy to retrieve and select.
5;Excellent Choice;All of my six cats love Newman's Own Organic foods. I feed them the dry food and the canned.
4;Good, not great;I enjoy the Cliff Fruit Twists, so I thought I'd enjoy these too.  These were okay, but they weren't wonderful.
4;Yummy.. but has a good amount of sugar in it.;This coffee is flavorful, creamy and it tasted a lot like a latte that you would purchase at a coffee house.  I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee and didn't think I would like it as much as I did.
5;Best GF cake!!;I have tried different cakes mixes and recipes and Pamala's chocolate cake mix is the best!! I like it even better than non gluten mixes. It is moist and delicious.
1;what LOBSTER????;this is VERY HIGH PRICED POTATO SOUP 1 TENTH OF A OUNCE OF LOBSTER FOR 6 BUCKS..
3;French?;I love the idea of Fair Trade, I love Organic, I was super impressed by the packaging..
5;MMM Good!;I love this Raw Cane Sugar so much that we order it by the case now.  It taste really good.
5;Fantastic Snack for Toddlers!;"My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES these.  And I can honestly say the word ""LOVE"" about this product."
3;Just okay;I love the Chocolate Mint and Peanut butter flavors, but this flavor tasted like vanilla whey.  It was not bad tasting, but I drink enough whey and have experimented with various whey ice cream recipes and this reminded mea bit of some of the concoctions I have made and for the price, it just wasn't that special of a treat.
2;Not for me;I tried Emeril's Big Easy Bold after purchasing a Keurig which came with a variety pack of K-cups.  I have to disagree on the great reviews of this coffee.
4;4 experiments, 4 different tastes;I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning.
1;Less than 12 hours to chew up the rope making it useless;My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.
5;Excellent Coffee for a Steal;Love this! Bought the two-pack, which was a great deal, and split it up into two gifts. I tried some of one gift, and the texture is rich, smooth, less acidic - everything one would expect from a quality Kona.
5;hot shot but;This stuff is by far  and wide the best..
5;Hello Panda Chocolate Cream Filled Mini Cookies.;These little chocolate cream filled cookies are pretty darn good.  I sent a few boxes with a friend of mine to take to work with her.
5;Yummy;I use these flavoring tablets crushed and added to powdered dry milk to make my own sugar-free flavored creamer. Irish Creame is my favorite flavor.
5;cornbread;This mix is excellent.  I don't tell my friends it is gluten free and they love it.
4;"The product is good, but don't count upon Amazon ""Prime"" making a two day delivery.";I find this expresso to be as good as any of the other top ESE pods but at a lower price.  It has a good, not overly strong taste, but enough to leave a slight tingle on the tongus.
2;Exceptionally mild;Used almost the entire jar and absolutely zero heat. I added some cayenne pepper to spice it up.
4;A whole lot of Gummi Bears;Decent value for the quantity.  The candy arrived fresh and was exactly what I expected.
5;Hard to find item but good;Good price for this hard to find candy.  Tastes just like it used to.
5;Amazing Raspberry Flavor;This is delicious dark chocolate with tart and flavorful freeze-dried raspberries. I highly recommend it.
4;Overall pleased;I have not tried the chocolate, but I am looking forward to trying it.  The original tastes like peanut butter.
5;The Best for Chicken;This seasoning is great.  Really adds flavor.
4;"good healthy alternative to ""junk"" bars";I love Larabars. These Jocalat are not my personal favorite but they are what you can get at a reasonable price through the subscription option.
5;yum, yum;Cooked up a bag, divided it in containers and froze them.  This week I made hummus.
5;Great food!;This is food especially designed for Cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues..
5;I Love it;I really do not like to review Coffee because it's a matter of personal taste. But I thought why not.
5;Great Beans Horrible Price;I have purchased these beans before when they were in the $2.00 a package range.
3;So I guess only Rabbit Meat is Murder?;Darn, you people are having alot of fun reviewing this item..
5;Fantastic food, but why the price increase?;This is one of the best foods out there.  My cats love it and no longer throw up every day.
4;Sugarless with carbs?;Delicious sugarless entry powered by sugar alcohols.With no cane sugar  why  do the contents show 21g carbs per 2 oz serving(fat 2.
5;Pretty great;I love this stuff. Does it taste like cheese? It depends who you ask.
1;Too much instant coffee;One third of the products were Grove Square instants.Hot choc.
2;If you enjoy coffee with any sort of coffee to it... this is not for you;I am not a dark roast person typically but apparently I need something richer than this.  The coffee smells wonderful right after it brews, but I don't think that the flavor carries over nor is there much coffee to the brew.
5;Ya Mon... Jamaica in Minnesota;My husband and I go to Jamaica about every 9 months (7 times so far). We are addicted to this (VERY HOT, habenero) hot sauce.
4;Subtle Chamomile Tea;****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags.
3;Rose Scented Tea;"""The Passion of this blend will enhance any encounter. Roses have long held the romance of lovers within their silky petals."
4;Pink salt!;We know the whole pink salt story.  If you don't, just google it.
5;Suprising great!;I saw Yerba mate on Dr Oz.So I came right here to find it and I discovered the Chocolate flavor.
5;Best tasteing coffee;This has been my favorite coffee for years. Really glad to find it on Amazon.
5;My Yorkies love this stuff!;After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth.
5;Hint - Get the chicken flavored pockets;Folks, you will find that most cats do -not- like salmon. Yes, it's counterintuitive.
5;Helps slow breast milk production;Used this to help slow breast milk production when I was breastfeeding.  Worked well!  I drank 3 cups a day.
5;Just like regular butter cookies!;When these arrived I put one in my mouth and was surprised and delighted at the buttery-crumbly-goodness! At least until I stared down and saw an empty box and a crumb-ridden shirt which had now lightly crept up so my belly was showing. That's when the regret hit.
5;very fine candy;This was sent as a gift to a relative who had undergone surgery because they are his favorite candy. He liked the quality and taste of the Cella brand.
5;WOW!  What a tasty cracker.;These taste just like thin and crispy garlic bread, yummy!<br /><br />They are very thin, but have a fair amount of tinsel strength -- they held up great to having tuna salad piled on them without giving way.<br /><br />They are incredibly low cal, three of the crackers for just 50 calories, and they are rather big
1;Does not live up to its cleverly advertised standards;I expected more than it turned out to be. My family seemed to like it but they weren't too crazy about it.
5;Great Stuff;"This is the same great coffee syrup I had as a kid in NYC but couldn't find for years.  Then, lo and behold, they started carrying it at my local A&P so I was getting my ""fix"" there."
5;Exactly as promised, and excellent follow-up from the merchant;I received this item with several other items - it was carefully packed in an individual, padded box within the larger parcel Amazon delivered.  While I prefer vanilla bean paste as a general rule, extract is much more economical and this is fairly good quality product with a standard alcohol base.
2;Disappointing Product;I was very underwhelmed with this product for several reasons.<br /><br />1) It's caffinated.
4;Great beginner matcha;"I certainly would not classify this as a ""blah"" tea, but when I want something flavoured it isn't what I'll reach for - the vanilla flavour is there, but I had hoped for stronger. I made some before work today, and as it cooled (I find it gets better as it cools) I just kept thinking that it tasted like extra smooth regular matcha."
5;Great on-the-go meal;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
5;meh.....;not the best toffee i have had, but pretty close. packaging was damaged and had some water damage from cold pack placed inside to keep chocolate from melting, and chocolates looked like they were thrown in, but i know that delevery via the mail wouldn't make it beautiful.
2;grandmom;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Depends on your taste;This is one that truly seems to depend on your taste in coffee.  I served it to five people at the office because I personally love it.
2;what about flavors?;"These are a pleasing size and retain a good texture, without the ""rubber eraser"" taste when chewed for a while, but all the various colors taste the same, with no decernable fruit flavors.  The purple (grape?) may have a slight tang."
5;I usually hate kicking a dead horse, BUT!!;I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality and great taste of this dark roasted coffee blend.<br />For coffee at any price this blend delivers a nice body and smooth but bold tase.
5;love this butter;i really like this protein butter. i put it n my Crock Pot Chili
5;Calm cookies;My mother was born and raised in England so I had been exposed to these cookies (biscuits to the Brintish) before they became famous as part of Prince William's groom's cake.  These are plain cookie wafers without frosting, nuts, chocolate, raisins or anything else to mess them up.
5;Best new flavor!;Okay, usually I buy organic cake mixes, but this was a new and unusual flavor so on an impulse I bought a package at my local Farm Fresh grocery store. I baked it in a bundt pan and only dusted it w/ organic powdered sugar as a frosting.
3;Love them but inconsistent;I love these chips and order them by the case. But it is a gamble since they often don't taste as good as they can.
5;Heaven;These things are GREAT! Could have been a total disaster but they nailed it, they taste just like pumpkin pie. It actually saddens me these will not be available all the time but I plan to stash about 40 boxes in my pantry with an eye towards the coming zombie apocalypse.
4;Four instead of five stars due to bulk quantity....;The golden flax is the tastiest and the opaque packing is a freshness plus.  The amount of flax meal
3;Flavor ok but they do not fit right;I ordered these because the price seemed good. I didn't care so much that they weren't the same as regular K-Cups as people said they fit.
4;Good Brew;This isn't as good as the real thing at Caribou but darn close. Full flavor and well rounded for a decaf.
5;Weird.... Why so much Amazon? These are GOOD treats and you should SELL them correctly!;These treats are my dogs favorites, its like stink bait for a fish! Too bad Amazon sells them for $11 when you can get them for a buck at the dollar store! Duh Amazon! They are great for my 8 lb dog and the ingreidients are good, made in USA so I feel they are safe and I wont have to read about it killing our pets on the news someday. And you dont have to spend a lot of cash for these! The best product I have found over the years.
5;Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity;"I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Very tasty and healthy;Wonderful flavor and whole grain.  Not strong enough for Swedish snacks,<br />it will break if you put a lot of food on it, making a mess.
5;Good for dogs on raw diet;My doggies eagerly look forward to their 'Biscuits' every day.  We feed raw turkey and chicken and these are used as a treat.
2;Yuck;I used to buy this product from a health food store and it was good. The store is a long drive away so I ordered it from amazon.
5;Do you like Samoas? Is that something you might be interested in?;These bars are so good, and my new favorites from the Health Warrior line. If you're a coconut fan, or even a Girl Scout cookie fan, these will be right up your alley.
5;Chuck;My dog(chihuaha mix) absolutelty loves these. He waits to get one every morning.
5;Quality and My Pooch Luvs It;I have the fussiest pooch you can imagine. She's a very pampered little bichon that's 9 lbs soaking wet.
5;Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa, Traditional, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12);Great product we love it..
3;Love how the cookies look, but not the taste!;I received these cookies super fast! I was so excited to eat it, but was completely disappointed with the taste. They are a bit dried.
5;Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!;I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.
5;Great price;I used to buy CET's from the vet, but these are almost half the price & ship free with Prime. Can't beat that.
3;Nothing special;This is a reasonably tasty, but not spectacular, little drink. It's got a good flavor to it, and I suppose if you're on a health kick, the nutritional stuff that it has and doesn't have might be relevant to you, but I only cared about the taste.
5;Love Ooolong Tea!;I fell in love with Oolong tea more than forty years ago
5;The pleasure is mine;I am very happy with the coffee.  It was sent in a timely fashion and was exactly what I ordered.
5;Perfect product;After searching amazon.com I decided to try this product.
5;Mild and Pleasant;I have been purchasing different mono-floral honeys, and was looking for one with a very mild flavor to use in my yogurt. I didn't want a flowery taste.
5;Excellent Cookie. Shipping & storage concerns.;This is an excellent seasonal cookie that has been around for almost 100 years. It consists of  a small cookie topped with marshmallow and then covered with chocolate.
5;The Real Deal.  Five Stars!;This wasabi is soooo much better than the stuff that comes in a tube - there is no comparison.  If you want real top-quality Japanese wasabi - just like in the Sushi Bar, then this is exactly what you are looking for.
4;Surprisingly Good;I was given six months of cakes for Christmas this year.  I've gotten two of them and they were very good!  When I opened the first I was afraid I wasn't going to like it very much - pumpkin cake - but it was lovely, dense, moist and yummy.
5;Beautiful Beans!;The delivery was prompt and the beans are beautiful.  Vanilla extract has gotten so expensive, I decided to make my own.
5;Love My Hard Pretzels!!!!;There's nothing like a good beer pretzel, I'm so happy to have found them at Amazon.com.
5;Wonderful substitute;I really enjoy this product. I use it in two ways, I chop it up and put it in a cabbage salad with oil, toasted almonds and sesame seeds, or I can bread it and fry it up with onions.
5;Love it;I love this cacao powder - very tasty.  I make a lot of cakes and brownies with it, I have also made several chocolate frosting dishes and they turn out wonderful.
1;Does not work;It has been sitting out for a week and the flies just sit on top of it or fly around it. Waste of money.
5;FAMILY FAVORITE!!;These taste great. Our whole family enjoys these for on the go snacks or anytime snacks.
5;GREAT TASTING GF GRANOLA!!;I would highly recommend this granola to anyone who is GF (and even for those who aren't it's great) - my family, who isn't GF, enjoys eating it, too.  One of the things I really enjoy about this granola besides the flavor is that it stays crunchy even when you add milk to it.
1;The Worst;I have tasted many different coffees in many years. This is one of the worst.
1;Thin - Wattery - Not worth buying;I have written MANY reviews of Amazon products. Most of them have been either 4 or 5 stars .
5;Pup loves it!;We just got a new dog.  She's just about a year old and could be classified as an agressive chewer.
5;UTI;My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year.
4;Good flavor without the guilt;These chips have some of the best barbecue flavor of any chip without all the grease. The texture is a little hard, so sometimes if I get a thick chip it hurts my teeth.
5;great;The product tasted good.  I enjoyed them.
5;quite pleased with the angel hair noodles;These are my favorite miracle noodle. Much better than the Fettuccine.
4;New to couscous;Until recently, haven't eaten couscous.  Great surprise.
5;Tasty for greens, nice container!;For clarification, all of the enclosed pouches are a MIXTURE of juicy pear and garden greens. I was confused until after I received them.
4;Caramel Wafers :);I first discovered caramel wafers on a trip to London.  Upon returning home, I ordered these and shared with co-workers the day they arrived.
5;Fast and fresh!;I just received my 5.5 pound tub of Red Vines.
5;Great Coffee Flavor;My husband really likes this flavor, also the Donut House Regular Coffee.  He loves that he can get such a great cup of coffee so fast in the K-cup machine.
5;Very high quality carbs!!;This is IT for breakfast!!  I eat this for breaky everyday with westsoy organic unsweetened soymilk and fresh blueberries.  I feel awesome for hours and I totally feel different if I eat something else.
5;Coffee cups;Love the flavor- everyone can choose just what they want.Strength can be varied using more or less water.
5;You gotta try these;Fantastically-addictive German candies -- if you've never had them, try them -- you're in for a treat.  It's the way these soft chewy candies dissolve on your tongue that is so special.
5;Love the bergamot flavor!;One thing I like about Stash teas is the packaging. Each bag is sealed in a foil pouch which retains the tea's flavor.
5;Scrumptious bar, nutritionally giving, allergy-kind.;I have never been one to rely on nor crave a nutritional bar. Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them.
1;Not Gold Coast;Starbucks and Amazon thinks this coffee is Gold Coast. It's not.
5;crazy for tiki cat;i almost regret buying this fancy cat food as a treat for my kitty bc she is crazed for it! it's a little expensive but the quality is outstanding and the happiness my kitty expresses makes it all worth it. i usually give her one can of this per day and one can of another type of wet food to keep the cost down.
5;Feel good about eating it!;"Read the ingredients, this is not a HFCS/processed chocolate bar!  However if you like ""REAL"" food and are looking to have a slightly sweet snack that is completely good for you then this is it!  I gave up sugar a few months ago, and these bars have been wonderful, a way to satisfy my sweet tooth will all natural fruit-sugar sweetness.."
5;My two cats love Paw Lickin' Chicken;I have two finicky eaters.  They will only eat Paw Lickin' Chicken canned food.
5;GREAT COFFEE;If you are looking for the finest Colombian coffee I doubt you could do better than the Eight O'clock brand. This has been a gem for many years in The Great A&P and now Waldbaum's and Pathmark.
5;The best tea I've had;I'm not a hot tea connoisseur, but I am a big iced tea drinker and occasional hot tea drinker.  These K-cups makes some of the best tea I've had anywhere and I've started to actually crave it.
5;The BEST Chai Tea ever!;The first time I had the Green Tea Chai was at a cute little tea shop in my neighborhood in Fresno, CA . This was not typical chai tea.
5;Very Nice And Good;I'm no coffee aficionado but I know what doesn't suck, and this coffee doesn't. It works well in my stovetop espresso maker as well as in the ol' Bunn.
2;Must have strong teeth;This is the hardest-to-chew raisin bran I've ever had. The flakes are large and bulky, and the raisins taste funny.
5;Another Natural Value favorite!;When I serve Natural Value, I only use the pate varieties because they don't contain the synthetic form of vitamin K, menedione sodium bisulfate.  My 2 girls love the turkey, but this one has to be their favorite.
5;Best cereal ever.;It tastes nice and sweet and has a nice chocolate center, It isn't too chocolatey or too sugary at all.<br />And on top of that it's vegetarian (Sorry Vegan's, It contains milk!)<br />It taste's wonderful.
5;Great Coffee, Great Price;This is my new favorite coffee!  And the price is a great value too.  I first tried this coffee from a local grocery store and was thrilled that I can purchase it through Amazon in 80 ct package at a great price.
5;Good flavor but be prepared;Most Hot Sauces that are extremely hot also taste horrible, that is not the case here. 2 or 3 drops added to your favorite lunch chilli/soup and your sinuses are cleared up for a while.
5;the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare;I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.
4;Yummy;Received this product a while ago but didn't make the waffles until recently.  Very good and easy to prepare.
3;Still not sure why they add Jasmine...;First, the positives:<br /><br />- Very well packaged, with two caps to keep air and light out.<br />- Seems like a high quality white tea from its appearance.
5;For the health conscious peanut butter lovers!;Excellent product! I use it to make smoothies & peanut sauce for my Asian inspired dishes! I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative to regular peanut butter. The only downfall, it's a bit pricey.
5;The Best Oatmeal Cookie I Ever Ate!;I received a sample of these cookies through Influenster.It was gone within a minute of receiving the package.
5;Excellent all around;I'm not much of a tea fan, but I wanted to add green tea.  This is excellent tasting tea if you like mint, and at a great price.
5;Pleasantly Surprised...Just like homemade;I'm very happy with this product & will order it again.  I was skeptical about ordering frozen baby food off of the internet but this arrived completely frozen and was fresh with natural color.
5;Pantry Moth Traps are the BEST;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Friskies Party Mix for Cats;Cats love it !  Our house cat and barn cat practically want nothing else to eat and I am ready  to order more through Amazon.com.
5;Very good tortilla chips;The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.
1;Shame on Kellogg's;"This was a great cereal but the shameful Kellogg's has done a ""bait and switch."" This is now a high carb/high sugar cereal with the same name."
5;Excellent;These are REALLY good. They taste just like chocolate covered raisins but are much healthier for you.
5;More K-cups;Walt loves Keurig's and Timothy's Expresso K-cups.<br />Just as good as that other expensive brand.
1;Very  old stock;I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product.
5;healthy & delicious;I absolutely love these, but I could see how some people might not.  They sort of look like cardboard coasters and they're dry and crumbly.
5;My dog likes these;I was worried my dog would chew on these and they would stain my bed, etc. They don't.
5;good tuna;very good. i could not detect any dolphin flavor.
5;Great pickle!!;This is some of the best pickle I've ever had! Great on papad. Give it a try.
5;Super Hot Sauce;"The label on  Frank's Hot Sauce says ""The Perfect Blend of Flavor and Heat"" and I must say this is an accurate description of the product.<br /><br />Frank's Hot Sauce is outstanding."
1;Bisconova Ladyfinger cookies for Tiramisu;I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed in the product. I mixed all my ingrediance for my Tiramisu, and then opened up the pkg.
3;Sweet 10 Liquid Artificial Sweetener;Sweet 10 Suguar Substitute arrived in the shipping window time, I think even a little early.  No problems with the shipping.
4;"The Biggest of the 8 Rawhides is BARELY 4"" - REALLY SMALL FOR PRICE";Would give 3 stars for how really small these are, but the shipping was so fast, I upped it a star.  The decrease of Subscribe & Save discount from 15% to only 5% really hurts the ability to get any good value on multi packs of dog raw hides.
5;love love love this;I tried this at mymoms and it was super tasty ..
5;Love it;I picked up this cereal when I was preparing for a hurricane.<br />We didn't get hit that bad, so I didn't have to use it.
1;Poor,;Flavor an texture are very poor.  Was hoping this whole wheat product would replace regular pasta but just does not measure up.
4;It's good, the bars are good;It's good, it's pretty good, the wife loves them, my kids love them.  But chocolate Peanut butter is cheaper and tastes better.
5;Best stuff I have ever used;I use this on veggies, meat, and about everything. It is especially good on veggies and chicken.
4;Yummy, but too expensive here;The Wabash valley purple popcorn is really good & a lot fewer hulls than the regular grocery-store brand. It is the favorite in our house! However, if you go to the company's own website you can buy the 6 lb bag for $8.
5;Excellent price for high protein grain-free food!;We really like this food for our extremely active German Short Hair pointer. She certainly doesn't need to lose weight, but we feed her this because of its high protein content and the fact that it is grain free.
2;not so impressive;Gave these treats to our 2 greyhounds.  They chewed and ate a bit of the beefhide outer wrapping, but learned quickly to just mash it and make the filling come out.
5;Wonderful product;I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it.
4;Great boost, taste not my favorite;Have used about 4 of these tablets and the boost of energy was so great I had to cut it down to 1/2 tablet instead and found that for myself that was a more desirable effect.  Was a bit too jittery with a whole tablet.
5;Great snack and dessert replacement potential;I have to admit that I was leery of a chocolate breakfast cereal, having never enjoyed the flavor at that particular meal since my boyhood Cocoa Puffs many, many moons ago. But these were excellent.
5;My Favorite Tea;Strong, soothing flavor.  I drink 3 mugs of tea every day and have tried numerous other, more exotic, more expensive alternatives but haven't found any tea I enjoy as much as this one.
1;Makes people run the other way ... if they can even still breathe!;A co-worker used to use this product.  The spray remains in the air and can be detected as a heavy scent several yards away (huge warehouse-type building), and caused asthmatic reactions after use in normal-sized rooms.
5;Bonsai Tree;Extremely fast packing and shipping.  Tree carefully wrapped.
5;Yummy;This is the best drink on earth! What you have to keep in mind before complaining is that it is sugar free. So you need to add your own if you want it that way.
5;The high liquid content might be great for finicky/senior cats;I have 3 kitties.  One of them is very finicky with food in general, and she only likes the liquid (I like to call it broth, haha) in these pouches.
5;Wonderful, Excellent, LOVED by my very finicky spoiled boy!;I have a Coton De Tulear (very rare breed). He's got attitude and is incredibly spoiled.
5;Premium tuna -- well worth the premium price;We were visiting Astoria, Oregon and toured the Cannery Museum. They were selling mixed 6-pack boxes of Skipanon tuna, salmon and sturgeon to raise money for a memorial, so I paid the $30 figuring at least we could eat the fish.
2;Not Cheerios and Not Applejacks either;I bought these (plainer box) at a Whole Foods. Definitely not worth the $4.
5;Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!;My dog loves this..
5;GREAT STUFF!!!;"I became addicted to this when a Japanese friend served it with fried pork many years ago. Even in our urban area, with many ""oriental"" food stores, it's very hard to find."
3;Not so chocolate, afterall;Bland chocolate flavor which lacks the true richness of palatable chocolate.  Certainly, could be better.
4;Yummy quick low fat snack;I really enjoy this product. The taste is great and the texture is nice and chewy just like jerky should be.
5;Yum!;I bought these thinking they were Anchovies which I love.  But they were Sardines.
5;Very happy with my purchase!;I was hesitant to purchase this due to all the negative reviews, but I am glad I ignored them. I ordered the pack of 35 on March 6th, and received my order on March 8th (using Prime).
5;GREAT;This is a great treat for my dog/puppy for training! I am taking classes and petsmart right now and they require us to bring our own pet treats. This is such a great treat and my dog loves it.
5;Very tasty, worth the money;I love cherry preserves.  I usually buy them from Trader Joes or local orchards here in Oregon.
5;Scumptious!;This chocolate treat has the sweet of the chocolate and the salt from the popcorn. It is outrageously good! Wish they added more popcorn and caramel but still a great treat.
5;This company is great.;Everything ships quick, product quality is high.  She is the big tea drinker and swears this is better than twinings (and cheaper too).
2;Too sweet, too weak;Using 8 oz water as the directions state made the cocoa much too weak. It was like hot water with a few drops of chocolate syrup.
5;Dog loves it!;I adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn. I checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn.
4;The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category';The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.
5;good taste;Love this flavor.  Good pumpkin taste with a hint of spices.
5;Yet ANOTHER of the best;"Between these three, they easily surpass Dove, Ghiradelli, or any other ""domestic"" or local competition.  If you want to get your money's worth and your goal is excellent hot OR cold chocolate taste, choose this or either of the other two cocoa's."
5;Sugar Free Drink;I LOVE this stuff! I needed to drink more water, but just couldn't stand it plain. I mix a little bit in my water and its the best stuff! I use to drink a six pack of pops a day and since I've been drinking this I haven't wanted one.
4;weight loss tool for dogs;My golden retriever enjoys this food-- in fact, she scarfs it down.<br /><br />I agree that this is a unique food in that it is low calorie yet also highly digestible.
5;Nueske's thick sliced applewood bacon;OK.  I know if you are reading this you must be a bacon fan or know someone who is.
5;post alpha bits cereal;my grandson and myself love this cereal. i cannot find it in stores anywhere near me.
5;Excellent;Exactly as described and extremely fast shipping. Came two days after I ordered.
4;Outstanding product.;Next to a fine dining restaurant (that knows what they're doing), this is the best polenta I've ever had.  Top with a saut&eacute
5;If you don't have time to start from scratch...;It's always better to start from scratch, and it's always better to be a well known executive chef, but most of us don't have time..
4;thanks!!!;great service and delivery for a really good product. i am constantly looking for a good hazelnut coffee and so far this is the best, along with green mountain.
5;Great flavor;Some teas smell great but when you taste them they are a disappointment.  This tea tastes terrific too.
5;Delicious;My favorite PopChips flavor is the Parmesan Garlic flavor, but this is definitely my new second favorite.  It does have a lot of lime flavor, with the chili flavor being a little less present.
2;Stale.;Strawberries had a stale/old sock taste to them. Had hoped for better luck than the previous reviewer, no dice.
5;great taste - low carb;This is a great product especially for those watching their carbs.<br />We just cannot tell the difference between this product and high carb pasta.
5;Natural, sun dried, no chemicals Raisins!;These Bob's Red Mill Raisins are the best! They are exceptionally sweet, moist, and tasty - maybe because they are unsulphured - and very fresh! We store them in the freezer (and even bake with them frozen) so they keep two years or more, if they last that long! Great snack, for trail mix, oatmeal cookies, raisin bread, curry, and anything you can think of. One taste of these raisins and you will not buy them at the grocery store ever again.
5;Wonderful coffee;I remember buying this coffee when I was stationed in Frankfurt Germany in the mid 80's and still love it. It's very rich and smooth without any bitterness.
5;Sweet as honey!;A great pick-me-up when exerting energy. I eat these while biking.
4;Good coffee, but not what I was hoping for;"I was lured to purchase this coffee because of its high ratings.<br /><br />Although I don't regret ordering it, I wish I had ordered my previous(and still current) favorite which is <a href=""http://www."
5;Yogi Berry Detox Really Works!;This tea really works!  It cleanses you and keeps you regular.  The taste can be overwhelming if you let it brew too long but the benefits are well worth it.
2;tasteless...;I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless.
5;Great tasting product, but very overpriced here.;Great tasting product but very overpriced here.  Available for a little over half price at retailers like Smart N Final.
5;Great Starbucks Taste for a Quick Fix!;Starbucks has outdone themselves on their VIA line of products.  As a full-time medical student, I am definitely a caffeine addict.
5;Buttermilk waffles ...Yum;What a great value! My wife and I eat buttermilk waffles at least twice a week. This powdered buttermilk is delicious.
4;good not great;I have been buying these for about a year now for my daughter.<br />These are a great on the go snack that anyonecan feel good about serving up.
5;My pup loves these!;Good quality product. I'm paranoid of my pup choking, these are very safe, could be left alone with these and fits perfectly into the puppy kongs.
5;Pure deliciousness;For reasons known not even to me, I have purchased about 25 types of honey, made from the nectar of different flowers. Of those many types, this is my clear favorite for eating by the spoonful.
5;Great taste and aroma;Since getting a Kuerig Coffee maker for Christmas, I have tries several brands of K-cups.<br /> I love the deep aroma and taste of Nantucket blend the best.
5;Best pop ever!;I crave this taste, it's the most delicious flavor ever. I went back to Michigan where I was born.
4;Good waffle mix;I didn't read the product info very carefully before buying it, and didn't realise that one had to add oil, water and an egg. It doesn't save much more time than making the mix from scratch, therefore, but it tastes good.
1;Not only Whole Jalapenos!;Being a fan of La Preferida pickled Jalapenos I was quite shocked when I received this product.  It has many other ingredients such as:<br /><br />Carrots (Big coins of them)<br />Onion<br />Garlic<br />Oregano<br />Soya Oil<br />Turmeric<br /><br />I'm not sure who uses Jalapenos like this, but they were not what I was expecting at all.
2;I want to love this stuff, as the ingredients are great, but: diarrhea.;Pretty sure this stuff is giving all six of my foster kittens diarrhea, which neither their dry kibble (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Kitten) nor their alternative wet food (Fancy Feast Classic grain-free varieties) do. I don't think they absorb much in the way of nutrition when the food shoots right through them, and of course it's a messy experience for me.
5;Rockstars...ummm...rock?;Actually, I work third shift and its these bad boys that keep me going most of the time. They're pretty addictive though if you like the taste, which is certainly not for everyone.
5;ayerim;I like this product very much, and living in an area where I am unable to purchase it locally, I appreciate being to get it through Amazon.  However, I'm disappointed that the Cappuchino is no longer available.
5;EXCELLENT BEEF JERKY;I HAVE BEEN EATING BEEF JERKY FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND THIS RATES WITH THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. EXCELLENT FLAVOR THAT MAKES YOUR MOUTH WATER FOR THE NEXT PEICE.
4;I like the taste, but the price is ridiculous;The vanilla and mint flavored Stevita drops are my favorite. As with any stevia product, you must be careful of the dosage.
5;Does the job!;"Paired these with the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Freakin' Awesome.;"The tea is excellent.  I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as Numi's ""Smoky Tarry"", but it came through, colors flying."
5;great;Exact same as the ones bought at the store only a lot cheaper. Recommended for any Keurig drinkers out there.
3;Be Careful To Buy Only The Original Whamo Superball;When buying these make sure you have the original Superball by Whamo the other fake ones do not bounce any where near as high.The original molds I was told were destroyed and these are from new molds.
5;The BEST FOOD for my Weimaraner;This dog food is the Best food for Heidi. She consumes 2cups per day and she weighs 85lbs.
5;Great Tea;I really like this tea I was looking for a Chai Tea that I could drink all the time and ran up on this. Although it tastes nothing like Chai Tea I like this much better it has the taste of something like red hot candies and since that is one of my favorite candies this fits the bill for me.
2;small and overpriced- High $$$$$ shipping;"super small candy bars, with high priced shipping. just buy a few ""score bars"" at your local 7-11 for a fraction of the price and a third larger toffee bar!!! these bars are real small, about 2/3's the size of a regular candy bar, and with shipping came out to $3."
5;Awesome chips;These chips taste great, are are not nearly as bad for you as regular chips.  I don't know anyone who has not like them.
5;Nothing Compares;Other oatmeals just don't come close to McCann's. I live in Germany so I make sure that I always pick some up whenever I'm in the States.
5;Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!;This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding.
2;Light-weight;"I thought I' try this flavor in the K-cups because I haven't done so in the past.  It is a little light-weight on the flavor unless your set your Keurig at the ""stronger"" setting."
4;Good stuff!;I like this, our dog likes it on her food also.  She seems to eat her meals more readily with this stuff sprinkled on.
5;My boy likes it.;The 3rd stage has more texture than 2nd stage. In the beginning, my boy doesn't like 3rd stage that much as his variety 2nd stage Earth's best.
4;Expensive;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Ew!;I buy little powdered cider packets at the store by the hot chocolate and occasionally simmer my own hot cider. My Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider was the third K-Cup I tried (I just got my machine for Valentine's Day).
5;Spicy with great flavor.;"This will not ""burn out"" your mouth. It is spicy with a great flavor."
1;worst I've had of this kind of snack;Maybe it's the whole wheat, not sure, but I've had peanut butter pretzels that taste way better than these.  They were extremely hard, almost stale like and then there was a really tiny wad of peanut butter inside an otherwise empty pretzel hole.
5;Best veg jerky;I think its interesting how spread out the reviews are on this product.  I guess its one of those love it or hate it type things.
5;A Welcome Change of Pace;I've been an avid coffee drinker for many years, but was only exposed to the sub par blends at my office. I was recently over at a friend's place when they introduced me to Kahve's Barcelona blend--now there's no going back.
3;Never again;They taste good but they'll send you to the toilet quickly and burn you up. There's better beef jerky out there.
5;Bowls licked clean!;I have two aussies, one senior and one teenager.  My teenager is very picky with her food and so far this is the first brand I have bought that neither dog leaves food in the bowl.
5;The best we've found;We've had our Keurig for about 2 years now, and have tried almost every single variety of the K-Cups. Caribou Blend is our favorite of all these.
5;Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet;I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet.
5;If you are on a diet, these are great. You MUST eat them slowly.;I was introduced to the Blair chips by a friend. I mostly ignore potato chips because I really don't like them.
4;VERY Pepperminty!;This tea has a very, very strong peppermint flavor as mentioned by fellow reviewers.  However, it's also very soothing.
3;Here's the chips;I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.
4;Shipping a little pricey;the product is good and better than they say. I reuse the caps several times and they work.
5;Waffles like on vacation!!;I wanted a waffle mix just like what is available when we travel and breakfast is provided by the hotel/motel.  This mix is perfect.
5;Works quite well!;I purchased these when our cat had heart problems and had to be left in a kennel when we were on a trip. She was very good at taking them there, without a fight or hassle.
4;Your cats will love it and it's good for them;After some health problems with our cats we switched over to a more natural diet.  This was the transitional food.
2;Watch out for constipation!;I picked up this formula over the holidays because the store was out of our regular choice (Earth's Best) and it was the only organic option.  Within 2 days of feeding it to my twin girls, they were outrageously fussy and straining terribly to pass gas or poop.
4;Very good value;We bought this to go with a small counter top cotton candy maker. I had no idea how little you need of the sugar to make a cone.
4;A little misleading;I was expecting 12 bags at 6 oz each.  I got one big plastic bag with all the candy in it.
5;Breakfast of Champions;This has been my default cereal for like two years now.  It is high in protein, has the perfect sweetness, perfect crunch, perfect everything.
5;Oatmeal for GF diets;I was so happy to find these oats. I have found the old fashioned and steel cut types in the local store.
4;Great for quick lunches;I bought these to keep in my office for when I need lunch but can't get out of the office to get something. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />It initially looks like there is not much in the package, but one packet combined with some rice makes for a great, filling lunch that tastes surprisingly authentic.
3;I wouldn't cook with it, but it may have medicinal applications;I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that.
5;I love this stuff;I tried this cereal at a friend's house and wanted to go out and buy a box for myself. I finally did and I'm glad.
5;Can't believe the difference in taste;Perfect product for salt grinders as it is too course for table use or for encrusting food. Perfect mellow, non-chemical, pure salt flavor.
5;THIS STUFF WORKS FOR US AND OUR DOGS LOVE IT - PERHAPS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOURS.;Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.
5;Eases my Morning Sickness!!;I am a very healthy person. I eat organic foods, take good vitamins etc.
5;Good treat;My dog loves these and they were fairly reasonable in price.  I didn't like having to purchase so may bags at once, but it does keep them fresh.
5;My Cats Love Fancy Feast;I have four cats and the grilled and sliced Fancy Feast is well eaten in my house.  Two of them are picky and refuse to eat some of the other canned food I put down.
1;Motts  bought from Amazon .;I gave this item one star due to the flavorless quality of this drink.  I have not used this product before, just went on the product name.
5;BE EATING SEEDS FOREVER!;I was so surprised at how much I got for the price, am use to the expensive little bottles from the store.  Will be trying some new ways to enjoy.
5;VERY EXCELLENT;I bought this Maple Syrup based on the reviews of this product and I am very pleased.<br /><br />In the past I had always purchased Grade A Maple Syrup at the market.
5;Training Treats;I love the Zukes treats for training on the go.  They hold up well in a training pouch or pocket and break easily into smaller pieces.
5;greatest coffee;I've recently purchased Tully's French Roast K-Cups from Amazon. Well this is the best coffee no bitter after taste, wonderful smell of coffee brewing, very  easy to make.
5;Best foreign coffee;I have had various coffees from around the world and this is my favorite. It has a mild, but not wimpy flavor.
5;Worthy of a recommendation;A friend recommended this coffee to me and it is worthy of being recommended by and to a friend.  I found the Breakfast Blend very smooth and full.
3;tzeig;My dog liked them alot. For the price he should have liked them.
5;greenies dental chews;Greenies dental chews are a product that my dogs love to eat.  Around 6:30-7:00 my dogs start to bark, jump up, follow me everywhere because it's time for their Greenies.
5;Wonderful, Great Tasting;My son just started the Gluten Free diet and I have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat. He loved it, I couldn't believe it at first but he kept eating.
1;Pentera water;Did not help my pain.not much better then any other water.
5;Zukes is great;Zuke's training treats are made with excellent ingredients, none of the crap I eat for myself. The small size allows me to give my golden more of them than a bigger size.
5;A Healthy Snack;A very tasty, organic 7g of protein and 5g of fiber, with only 9g of sugar and 200 calorie snack which is good for those on the go or those who who just want something healthy. This combination (Peanut Raisin Crunch) is very tasty.
5;Jamaica Me Crazy K-Cups;As always, I LOVE this coffee, it's about the only kind I buy for myself.  The turn around time is terrific.
5;AMAZING;This tea is amazing.  Right out of the bag you can smell the lemon and spearmint.
5;For the black licorice fans...;I've munched on black licorice since I was a kid.  This is stronger, softer and a much healthier alternative than most.
5;My favorite!;I just bought the Keurig B70 for my husband (and myself!) for Valentines Day. We opened our brewer and chose the Caribou blend for our first ever K cup.
5;Happy Puppy dogs!;I like having delivered w/free shipping! There are two flavors per shipment. I think Pedigree is a good name and my dogs love it.
5;Delicious and nutritious snack for kids or adults...;These are packed with flavor and with vitamins.  I recommend them as a healthy snack for kids or adults.
3;Careful giving gifts;One might think you'd not have to think about gluten intolerance when buying tea. One would be wrong.
5;Dog likes it fine;This formula seems to actually be vegan. My dog has been eating this for several years now and it has completely eliminated her constipation.
1;BRAGG'S LIQUID AMINOS, A NON NATURAL CHEMICAL!;"Why have we become such consumers of crap sold to us in the name of ""good for you""<br />stuff made in an artificial/chemical manner and void of goodness?<br /><br />Please read the following and be educated!<br /><br />[.."
5;Big Smiles!;I take various snacks into work and get repaid by the honor system.  I thought I'd try these because they are something different from the usual chips & cookies.
5;Frogs are Delicious!!;I recently bought a bag of these on here to try, my fiancee and I love Haribo candy, especially the Gold BEars and wanted to try these..
5;Overall great meat snack;It's healthier than most meat snacks, and it is filling. Great for those moments that you are either too busy or too lazy to make a meal.
5;Allen's Field Peas are oh so good!;These little tiny field peas are the best!  They are one of my favorite vegetables.  If you have never had them, I think you should try them because they are awesome.
5;I'm on my second order - we love this stuff;I don't use any other sweet pickle relish since trying this.  I store it upside down in the fridge so it's always ready to go.
5;Finally ... I've found puppodums!;I used to buy puppodums from another company (Sharwoods) but they don't seem to carry them anymore. When I found these, I was in heaven.
5;LOVE LOVE this cereal;We recently found out that our 13-month-old son is allergic to a multitude of foods, gluten being one of them.  We purchased a box of these and the plain Chex Rice Gluten Free cereal from our local grocery store and he loves both of them.
5;very good;I have a very old cat which has lost teeth and her appetite and it seems that this food is one that she will always eat. She was my granddaughters cat but I have had her for 3-4 years she is 14 and though thin is active and healthy .
5;Good product if you like smoked mussels;I've used smoked mussels for umpteen years, and these are quite fine. I love them.
4;Great product, great price;I want to get my dog off of grain-based and mystery protein foods but didnt know where to start. I researched a lot of brands on the web and decided on this one for several reasons: USA made, all USA meat products, no grains, no mystery or questionable protein or fat products, and reasonable price.
5;Late July Organic Crackers;Our family loves these healthy, organic crackers!  They taste good and are good for us!<br />I order them through automatic shipping as they are a staple at our house.  Perfect with<br />soup or late night snacking with peanut butter.
5;9 Week Old Lab loves it;Our pup lab loves these.  He often gets bored of his other chew toys but this one he actually spends 20 minutes chewing on.
5;Amazingly Versatile Red Chili Oil!;I have tried and loved all of the Exravagonzo infused olive oils, but my favorite is the Red Chili oil.  I have used it in everything from salmon to citrus salad to chocolate chip cookies.
5;Delicious and Healthy!!!;I love this milk!  It's the perfect soy alternative!  It's very chocolatey, sweetened perfectly, and so yummy when it's been chilled.  The size is perfect, and the straw on the side makes it perfect for taking along anywhere.
5;Iris Cheese;I send a gift of this cheese for Xmas.  They appreciate very much and enjoyed the cheese.
5;GOOD STUFF;Great Cookies. These are a great raw food cookie.
4;Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup;This was my original statement, but until Canada stops the brutal killings of the baby seals there I am boycotting all products from Canada. (I was so happy to find this organic maple syrup at such a reasonable price.
3;Great chew;Kept my yellow lab busy for at least 20 minutes. He figured it out in no time to get the treat out of the mold.
3;These are fried apple slices;These apple chips have good flavor, they're just a little bit sweet, and they have a bit of a crunch.  That being said, I was a bit turned off by the product quality.
5;Creamy and  Delicious;All Annie's products are excellent. Beats the other name brands<br /><br />for flavor.
5;The Best By Far.;It would be difficult to find a better pure extract than this Nielsen-Massey offering.  Like several other reviewers here, I use a lot of this product in baking.
5;Gotta Love them;Great Quantity.  Individually wrapped.
5;Best way to get the best gum;I've been chewing this gum for around two years now, and it will always be my favorite. It has the most delicious, longest lasting flavor of any gum I've tried.
5;Instant Dinner;A can of this chili and a few toppings: sour cream, onions, cheese, avocado, makes for a perfect dinner. Honestly, this chili is better than most chili made with meat.
5;amazing chips;i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing.
5;probably among the best sugar free and no sugar added biscotti and cookies;"AUNT GUSSIES SUGAR FREE AND NO SUGAR ADDED BISCOTTI AND COOKIES ARE AMONG THE BEST SOLD.ESPECIALLY OUTSTANDING ARE ITS ""NO SUGAR ADDED CRANBERRY ORANGE BISCOTTI WITH ALMONDS AND CHOCOLATE CHIP BISCOTTI AND COOKIES."
4;Working good so far;My wife and I have triplets (two girls and a boy) and had to supplement with formula when they began eating more. They were on Similac Neosure which was very hard on our girls' stomachs (our boy handled it fine) and suffered from bad reflux.
5;My dogs love them!;I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.
4;Starbucks instant coffee;For what it's designed for it's okay.  No comparison to the real stuff.
1;the first bag was good and the rest were bitter!!;I bought 5 bags of it thinking it would be great for working out, energy and it's protein and mineral content.  The first bag I opened was okay and I could tolerate it in shakes and sprinkled on food with hemp protein powder.
5;Yummy as ever but smashed to smithereens...;We LOVE these chips - they are addictive.  Only thing wrong with this shipment is that they crammed all 24 bags into a small box and smushed a lot of them in the process.
5;Fenugreek + other doctor-prescribed tips to increase milk supply;I had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins. Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference.
4;Methi seeds;"Methi seeds are not a ""grocery store"" product in my area. I was very happy to find them and am satisfied with the product and the delivery time."
5;Possibly my Favorite K-Cup;I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.
5;Delicious!;Our family of 4 loves this product.  This is my second bulk purchase of crunch-n-munch.
5;Lucky;I guess I was one of the lucky ones. When these went on sale for about a third of their usual price, I picked one up as a gift for my chocoholic wife.
3;An old family favorite;If you're old enough, you remember when this stuff went on sale 4 boxes for 1.00 and it wound up being a side dish with a lot of meals.
5;Just like at the Vet's office - Only a whole lot less $$$!;These chews are among some of my Westie's favorites so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to buy them from Amazon, and at about $8 less per package than what the Veterinarian's office charges. Glad to be able to keep a good stock on hand and bought 2 packages for only a couple of dollars more than I would have paid for one.
5;Necessity;I had been using this product for years, but can no longer find it in the stores. It is a key ingredient in my asian inspired bloody marys.
4;Cats love the food, but no pull-tab top, and dented cans.;I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.
5;Great taste for Fiber & Protein;I just discovered these KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Coconut, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars at an airport. These were great.
5;Such a great value;this is the best bang for your buck that you can get for coconut oil and from a quality company too.<br />Coconut oil also has a higher burning temperature and contains important Medium Chain Fatty Acids.
5;Wonderful!;I've searched and searched, but have been unable to locate a store that carries these delicious gummy treats in the US.  I was so excited to see them at Amazon.
5;Fresh and fast delivery;Who could not like a Nestle Crunch bar? Very tasty treat, and it came well packed (all six bags are in a plastic pouch which eliminates any shipping damage from the individual packs moving aroung in the box). Great price on the Gold Box deal as well.
2;Alright... maybe 2 1/2 stars;I got this for soap making. I'm a beginner so I can't really say anything about the quality.
4;My dogs love Greenies;Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.
5;So, so good....;This is definitely one of my favorites it has a fresh and great coffee taste, it's delicious. This will definitely be a must buy for those that like strong (almost espresso) coffee.
5;Surprisingly good;I don't like granola, I really dislike granola bars, and my family LOVES these.  Unlike other bars, they are crispy instead of soft and gooey, so they are more like a crunchy cookie.
4;helpful organizer!;Short and Sweet:  We mounted this to the wall behind our Keurig to organize our teas, coffees, hot chocolate, etc.  It freed up a lot of counter space and it's much nicer looking that having the individual boxes of K-cups lining the counter.
5;Best Thing Ever!;This coconut oil is the best I've used by far! I use it for everything, cooking, baking.  I love using it on my skin and hair and this stuff smells amazing! it smells like coconut candy.
2;Not so great;I heard about this salt on a forum a while back. Many people said it was the real thing.
5;Pleased;I wasn't sure what these pepperoni slices would taste like, (since Bridgford isn't a brand I'm familiar with) but was pleased with the purchase.  Unlike the other review, there was no foul smell upon opening any of the packages.
4;Great for storage, iffy for use with adapter for feeding;These VIA containers are great for milk storage.  Easy to clean and easy to stack.
5;STU;I was very surprised how well the lemon lotus worked. I was using mood & minds Kratom (great stuff!) and I asked about the lemon lotus liquid shot, & the lotus powder.
5;Yummy!;I've eaten these fruit snacks for years (the cherry flavor is my favorite).  They are DELISH and have a firm consistency that I love.
3;Great product.  GRAND price....go to Costco;My doggie loves these things.  I paid something like $28 for them.
4;Smooth;This is a great mid morning coffee, best for drinking after I have already had my jet fuel. It is a medium strength coffee, but has great aroma and flavor.
5;Nice change from plain kippers;Just enough mustard to make them good and not over-power the smoked kipper in the sauce.  I like them and will buy them again.
5;Love it!;Best moisturizer I've used thus far. I have dry /sensitive skin and this product takes care of all my needs.
4;Satisfiying;I'm not going to argue with those who say this is an outstanding tea. I myself personally reserve that distintion for loose leaf teas.
5;Best I have had;I first tasted soda bread from an authentic Irish restaurant that served carrot soup and Shepard's Pie.  I have been on a quest to find that matching flavor, and Garvey's produced it.
5;Super flavor ...;The BEST frozen pops I've found, and I think I've tried all that Amazon has to offer plus all the brands carried in my local supermarket.<br /><br />The flavors are bright and refreshing, not overly sweet, and totally recognizable.
5;Pine Salt;Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.
5;Addictive;I can't eat less than a whole bag.  Once I open it, it's gone.
5;Very tasty.;Having usually eating store baught peanuts I'd have to say the taste was much to my supprise..
5;Great for what they are!;I agree with the reviews that these Mac & Cheese singles are a bit runny, and maybe even a bit bland.  I always add a little seasoned salt to mine, and let them sit for a minute to thicken, and then I love them.
5;Great tasting veggies;Adding pear for natural sweetness makes the two green veggies go down so much easier.  Really yummy.
3;Too sweet for me....;I love chocolate biscotti with nuts but found this variety on the sweet side.  The cookies are a pale, milk chocolate color and they have a malted milk flavor.
4;Yummy Substitute for Ice Cream;Thought it does not have quite the sweetness of ice cream, I found the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter flavors to have a very pleasant choclatey flavor and smooth texture.  I let my pint sit on the counter for about 10 min before digging in, and it had an almost mousse like consistency - very impressive!  Hard to believe this stuff is good for me and I can eat the whole pint without feeling the guilt I'd get with a pint of Ben & Jerry's.
3;Not worth the price;Amazon says that I have purchased this before. I sure did and I liked it at the price I paid at the time.
4;Ideal;There's a lot to like about Ekojava - sealed packets ideal for single servings using a Solofill (altho cleaning them for the next cup can be a bit tedious), easy storage, the ideal storage item easily recyclable..
5;Excellent Chips.;These are excellent chips.  I have enjoyed them in larger bags and was happy to find these affordable smaller bags, as they are so good that I can easily eat the whole bag if I buy a big bag! They arrived fast and very fresh.
5;I really like this coffee;I'm not a big Starbucks fan..
4;Great holiday breakfast snack;After reading how many people were trying these new pop tarts, I had to go buy some.  I bought 4 boxes of them!  And I'm glad I did, because everyone in my family loves them! I am not normally a fan of Pop Tarts, because I find them to be too sweet.
5;Love Dr. Zevia;Finally a soda that doesn't contain sugar and doesn't have all the fake sugar poisons either! I wasn't sure I would like the taste so searched for it locally. Finally found it at QFC (just had a few flavors) and PCC (had a lot of flavors including Dr Zevia).
5;Excellent;These are excellent - I use organic chicken broth low sodium from Amazon Pacific - you won't go wrong buying these potatoes and these keep well and lovely to have on hand when you are in the mood for mashed potatoes.  I add powdered, organic, of course, onion powder and organic parsley.
3;If it looks good, is it good for the cats?;My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.
5;Good onion powder;I'm a big fan of Tone's products and this product is no exception. I had been using a different brand of onion powder, which would probably be described as fine granular in texture.
5;Great Stuff!;This stuff literally smells like bbq'd chicken! It's actually that good.<br />My dog will do anything to get these treats, plus they're totally healthy.
1;Taste is off, my grandma agrees!;There is something off tasting about my grandma's coffee cake. i've had it twice now and the last time with my own grandma believe it or not.
3;Pleasant, But Ordinary Vanilla Coffee for a Cold Day;The doorbell rang on a frozen rain-rattled November afternoon. The postman left a box of Starbucks vanilla flavored ground coffee.
5;Five paws up for these treats;I have given these treats to our four dogs and my friend's dog.  The dogs range from 38 lb.
4;A bold, fresh tasting tea with individually enveloped tea bags;A very nice Black Tea!<br />Each tea bag is individually enveloped, and they do stay fresh. and the tea is sourced by Ethical Tea Partnership standards -<br />[.
4;I've never seen the Blue Mountains;"I have never seen the blue mountains so i can not rightly say for a fact, ""yes this is the real deal.""<br />However after reading about this famous coffee i decided to try it for myself."
3;Ok for lipton;The tea was okay.  It didn't have as strong of a favor as I would have expected.
4;Great product. some squishing in shipping.;This is one of those things that comes along every so often that you wonder how you managed without. I hate having to go back to peanut butter and a spoon because its messy and takes three times as long.
5;This coffee newbie loves it!;I just wanted to add my opinion as a non-coffee connoisseur.  I picked this product as my first bag of coffee because I wanted to buy something relatively environmentally friendly and pre-ground.
3;Crema e gusto;I have tried both lavazza crema e gusto and this one, the Rossa.<br />Rossa has an infusion of choclate flavour,which is good if you like your coffee mixed with other flavours.
5;yummy;This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.
5;Absolutely delicious;These are absolutely outstanding pretzels.  They melt in your mouth, slightly salty, creamy, cruncy.
5;Best basic food;Mother used to give me Cream of Rice when I was ill, as a child, and I was ill a *lot*.<br />Now, I'm nearly end-stage with ulcerating Crohn's disease, but still find that Cream of Rice can be digested without pain, and quickly alleviates nausea which accompanies Crohn's flares.
5;Great Organic Coffee;I've been told I have an allergy to pesticides used in many coffees.  I can drink this one all day.
1;My dog broke it quickly;I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it.  I just filled it with a handful of kibble.
1;Coffee Direct Mexican Altura - Avoid!;I ordered 5 lbs. of this (with which I am stuck now), expecting a typically mild Mexican coffee.
1;Incorrectly Advertised;The 80 count pack is incorrectly advertised as costing .01 per count.
1;Wow...really bad. Very strange after-taste;I love the pumpkin spice lattes from Dunkin and Starbucks.  This product is spicy and no hint of pumpkin at all.
5;Slim Jim heaven;I got one of those $25 gift certificate in the mail, and couldn't decide what to blow it on.  This was great.
5;WOW!;"I have been cracking coconuts for years, but my wife and daughter can't do it when I am not around so I decided to try ""The Nut"" in a bottle. I was buying a different brand and thought it tasted nothing like the real thing, but was acceptable for smoothies."
5;YUMMMY !!!;I carefully read everybodys review and ordered these and I really like em. They are super for that 3 o'clock slo down .
5;Daughter's first choice;"My adult daughter is ""into"" saving the planet, tigers, water resources, trees, etc. She chose this chai tea after discovering an old tea infuser in the kitchen drawer thinking it would be grand to make tea ""the old fashioned way""."
4;Nice taste;This is good tasting tea at a decent price.  My only problem is not really with the tea but probably me, if I drink green tea on an empty stomach, sometimes I turn green myself.
5;crunchies!;Reviewing a cat food seems..
5;I'm in LOVE with this tea!;It is sinfully delicious and a nice way to end the day. But wait.
5;where's the beef;Product is great, and so is shipping, but down here in red neck country they have never heard of good Italian beef and sausage sandwiches loaded with green peppers and hot Giadinera. Also, the bread is awful.
5;Couldn't Be Happier;I received my beans in a promptly manner and was able to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar, and have extra for cooking purposes. The beans were moist, fresh, and very aromatic.
1;Not the Miracle I was looking for!!!;Kids would not touch them and I didnt even dare trying them. I am preggo and I dont think that would have gone over well with the little one.
4;Sweet Hot is exactly that;Definitely a moister, kippered-style jerky.  Not the ultra dry kind that makes your teeth hurt.
4;Cream Style Corn;My primary attraction for this product is the small can.  The corn is of average quality, but it better suits the need of a person preparing meals for one.
3;Not the coffee I expected;What I ordered was the Donut Collection Light Roast, but what I received was BOLD. It's good coffee, but not what I ordered.
5;i am so pleased;I recieved the grains within a couple of days of placing my order. They arrived in great condition.
5;Quick and easy chicken tandoori;Authentic and flavorful. Just mix with yogurt, EVOO, and a little vinegar.
5;WOW!;I normally hate, hate, hate citrus anything in my tea.  I always thought it tasted the way lemon dish soap smells.
3;Damaged cans;I was surprised to receive 4 damaged (popped) and therefore unusable cans in this shipment.  This had never occurred previously.
5;Wonderful Coffee, Wonderful Company;I stumbled upon this coffee at Whole Foods a few months ago and after the first taste, it became my favorite!  It it bright and clean with a slight chocolate influence.  The company matchs my goals also.
5;Perfect selection for me;13 caffeine coffees, all different roasts: 8 Green Mountain, 2 Coffee People, 1 Tully's, 1 Donut House, 1 Dietrich<br /><br />11 frou-frou caffeine coffees, all different flavors: 7 Green Mountain, 2 Gloria Jean, 2 Donut House<br /><br />7 decaf coffees, all different roasts, 1 frou-frou (hazelnut): 3 Green Mountain, 2 Donut House, 1 Caribou, 1 Emeril's<br /><br />3 teas, all different - 2 herbal and 1 black: Celestial Seasonings<br /><br />1 hot cocoa<br /><br />Of the 35, 3 were past buy-before dates
4;Thin, tasty, and no GI issues (for me);These are thin so that several can be put in a pack without taking up too much room.  The packages are about 5x4 inches and 3 or 4 packages stacked is about an inch.
5;Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.;After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.
5;Tasty and good for your dog;My Boston terrier loves these!  They are great Kong toy fillers.  Besides being tasty, they are made in America.
1;Awful;I enjoy my Sodastream machine and have purchased many of the diet flavors. The only one I don't like is the Diet Cream- it is undrinkable.
1;Not Pomace Oil at all;I received a gallon of canola oil with a label of olive pomace oil. This is fraudulent and a cheat.
5;Totally terrific, suited to an adult's taste;A really high quality cookie with a delicate tang of blueberry and a slight buttery taste.  Finely milled flour, so the texture is not coarse.
5;BEST chips!!;"My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the ""BEST"" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like."
5;mom loved it;My 86 yr. young Mom is a Rhubarb fan.
5;ldh;Purchased the tea bags for bridal shower favors.  I stuck on a customized sticker on the tea bags, and everyone loved it.
5;Zico Coconut Water;Zico's taste is the best of all the pre-packaged young coconut water I've tried.  Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.
5;Kuerig Cappuccino;I love my Kuerig and especially love the variety of drinks that I am able to make with it. Product was just as stated and arrived in a timely manner.
5;Great deal and the dogs love 'em!;If you've ever priced dog treats..
5;Love it!;This is now my new favorite K-cup flavor!  Anytime I see chocolate raspberry truffle flavored coffee beans I buy some since it is sometimes hard to find.  I was sooo excited to see a k-cup with this flavor.
5;My absolute favorite;I love this tea. Spicy sweet,  If your first pick in the chocolate aisle is the one with the hottest chili nibs, this is your no-calorie alternative.
5;Almost $4 a bag & messy. So why do I give it 5 stars?;Taste. A very natural taste.
5;Enjoyed again and again;A fairly small bone, but our (15 lb) dog enjoyed it thoroughly. We are able to re-stuff it with cream cheese or peanut butter or dog food, so it is quite reusable and one of her favorites.
5;A WONDERFUL MEMORY RELIVED!!!!;I so missed Drakes cakes and unfortunately they' re not sold in Ca. So I took my chances and ordered them on the net.
5;More like Extreme Wing Concentrate...;"This stuff is awesome.<br /><br />I followed the recommendations from Ashley Foods ""This wing sauce possesses heat from Hell for the wildest heat-freak, but can be tempered for more civilized folk by mixing it with any favorite sauce or marinade."
5;Great stuff!;We love Ginger Juice!  I don't know how anyone could get by without this stuff. I add it to stir frys, veggies, cookies, cakes, anyplace you'd like a splash of ginger.
5;The only thing I have ever been addicted too...these chips!;I have never been addicted to anything in my life..
4;Better than TAZO;I love this Chai Latte, I have one every morning! I like it better than TAZO for its perfect sweetness. I like mine better when I add 1 cup of milk and choose the medium size.
5;Pure Hydration;Mark Rampolla introduced Zico in 2004 after discovering coconut water as a Peace Corp volunteer in Central America
3;'Clean' shampoo has a pungent perfume scent, works OK as a shampoo;Like most women, I'm always on the lookout for that next really great beauty product, whether it be a cosmetic, a perfume, or a hair product. One of the basics for me is having healthy, pretty hair.
5;Perfect treat for training and other things;I've bought Zukes Mini Treats, chicken for such a long time.  I heard about it on TV series.
5;R dog luvs these;Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.
1;Look so healthy but made in China!;I liked these treats for my dog and he seemed to find them very tasty.  Then I read they were made in China -- given other pet food product issues that originated there, I threw the several bags purchased away.
3;Decent Tofu, but store-bought is comparable...;In the last few years I've started eating tofu more frequently. Most of the time I just fry it up in a pan with some Italian seasoning, black pepper and (once golden brown) a sprinkling of soy sauce.
5;love love love;I was worried about ordering such a lg bag of coffee beans, but for my expresso / coffee machine i needed arabica coffee and this bag of beans is just what a cup o joe needs to be..
5;Exactly as described, and a lot better for you than most gum;Xylichew does not contain artifical ingredients or sweeteners that are borderline cancer-causing.  In fact, it has xylitol, that in some clinical studies has been shown to actually re-crystallize teeth.
5;cinnamon red hots;If you love cinnamon red hots, this is it in liquid form.<br />I make iced tea
5;Excellent value for a decent tea;While a cup of Lipton is not going to stack up taste-wise to more premium brands or a good loose tea, they make a very solid, decent product that tastes good either hot or cold.  This particular packaging is a really good value if you get it on one of the Amazon sales -- the cost per 48 bags (the number you get in a normal size box) comes out much better than if you buy it in a store or even in the 12 box pack from Amazon.
5;fyi;"""They found that two of the licorice compounds, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were the most effective antibacterial substances. These substances killed two of the major bacteria responsible for dental cavities and two of the bacteria that promote gum disease."
1;Do not purchase NeCap refillable capsules Disaster;this is a comment and review of the Ne-Cap Nespresso® Compatible Refillable Capsules for Machines Before and After 2010.<br /><br />This product is the most dissapointing item ever purchased from Amazon.
5;Great flavor;"I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the ""bold"" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second."
5;Love Achiote and this is a convenient form;Funny enough, I used this for dinner last night!  We love the Anchiote and coriander flavors.  I added some cumin along with two packets of Sazon to thawing chicken breasts.
3;Isn't crunchy enough, but pretty tasty;Krave sort of look like long Captain Crunch, but they're considerably softer and less dense than Captain Crunch.  If you don't eat them right away, they just turn into a bowl of chocolaty mush.
5;Delicious and Nutritious!;My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick.
5;Maxwell House does it right;I was surprised at the pleasant flavor of this coffee. Robust enough to satisfy, with a great smooth, full taste.
1;disgusting artificial flavor;this stuff tastes NOTHING at all like real coconut water.  it has a weird tangy, fake coconut taste.
5;Pretty good;I by and large agree with the previous reviewer (A.M.
5;High quality food;I did A LOT of research on cat food before adopting my cat. I decided to feed him only canned food, with occasional crunchy treats.
3;Good Product Worth The Money;Found the product to work perfectly fine in my machine. Never got stuck and<br />always removed itself with ease.
4;What we tought about kind bars recently purchased.;We ordered the Almond Apricot, Almond Coconut, and the Mango Macadamia.<br /> We actually liked them in the order listed.
4;Special K Protein Plus;Crisp flakes, with a good amount of flavor. For cereal lovers, it's a good way to get protein in the morning, and the total carbs are low enough for my diabetic diet.
5;Bags on Board;The bags are sturdy and were received in a timely manner.  Love all the different colors too.
5;Best K-Cup Coffee Yet;I really like this flavor, it is really smooth and light, but not weak tasting..
1;This oatmeal is horrible!!!;Review is for the apple cinnamon variety, but I am sure that many ingredients are the same -<br /><br />I bought this oatmeal to eat at work, thinking it would be healthier than the typical Quakers oatmeal.  I immediately noticed that it wasn't as sweet, but then I noticed that it was giving me headaches and making me jittery too.
5;Wonderful K-cups;The Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Chef's Reseerve Columbian Decaf is fantastic and very delicious.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a great cup of coffee.
5;Love it!!!;I have been taking this for 2 months now and love it.  I am always on the go and often do not eat as well as I should.
5;We LOVE Churchies!!!!!!!!;After using the very last bit from my Cherchies Champagne Mustard jar I sent my significant other to the cheese shop where I have always been able to find Cherchies. A very helpful clerk helped him look thru all the mustard, then checked the stock list to see if some was on order, & then called several of their stores & no one had even one jar! I should have known I could count on Amazon to have my favorite mustard for chicken & sausage & ham.
5;cat favorite;My cat LOVES these treats. If I forget to give a few out before I get into bed my guy makes sure I do not get to close my eyes!<br />I have tried other flavors and brands but these are a sure bet.
5;I love it and my dog loves it!!!!;Got this with a recommendation from a friend.  Best buy ever!  My dog tends to eat fast, well this slows him down to a much more easy pace.
5;Love this tea;Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.
5;Blotto cries for it!;My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet.
5;Old man appreciates history;I enjoyed the wayback machine with this purchase and found these wafers in good shape at an excellent price. I have been sharing with my office and they too find the memories roll in with each taste.
5;A stronger cuppa!!;I used to buy Tetley's British blend from the supermarket but tried this tea and found it stronger and more to my taste. A little more expensive but worth paying a little extra.
5;macaroni and cheese;muellers is  my favorite macaroni for macaroni and cheese. I am sorry that it is no longer as available as it used to be.
4;EnviroKids Berry Bars are a livesaver;Both of my children are gluten free and we are always looking for easy and delicious snacks to get us through the day. I am a big fan of EnviroKids products, including the Crispy Rice Berry Bars.
4;Good quality and fresh;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;GF taste of days gone by...;The cookies remind me of the GF quality available like 6 years ago. Very dry, crumbly, odd crust.
5;Taste like Cherry Pie;These are wonderful for travel and snacks.  The taste is great.
5;Delish;Homemade cranberry sauce with this almond extract is delish!<br /><br />Cook cranberries in water and sugar over medium heat til berries begin to burst.  Remove from heat and add this lovely almond extract.
1;less than 1 star;if i could rate this -0, i would.  i have had oodles of sugar free products and have never had anything that was as bad as these little chunks of wax.
2;lots of sharp twigs;My cats seem to like the smell of this catnip.  However, I usually crush catnip to release the scent before I give it to the cats.
5;Best Popcorn Oil;I've tried many different types of oils and this one is the best. You will not be disappointed.
1;Weird and icky;I'll stick to Whoppers, thank you very much. It's not like I don't enjoy expensive high end chocolate, either.
3;Inconsistent (was:Coffee for tea drinkers);As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.
5;Grains not Good for Cats or Dogs;My cat immediately took to this product. Like everyone else has said this food has a very strong smell, but my kitty loves it.
4;Soup to go!;This soup is delicious, healthy, and perfect to bring to work when you're on the go. The bulk packaging was ideal and less expensive than buying each one individually.
5;Best coffee EVER!;I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.
5;Wonderful;This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference.
5;This is great stuff;Coconut oil is a very useful, and healthful oil,<br /> either as a substitute for less healthy cooking oils,<br /> or as a healthful nutritional supplement in its own right.<br />At 55¢ per oz.
5;my yorkie LOVES ZiwiPeak!!;organic, antioxidant & omega-rich, air-dried venison, and loaded with recommended essential vitamin & nutrients..
5;Tea review;I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.
4;Seems to prevent brain fog, but nothing spectacular;I've been on the Brain Toniq (1 can a day) for 2 months, with a pause of 1 week while traveling. My diet is healthy (exclusively from Trader Joe's or Whole Foods), includes chicken meat and seafood, but no beef, pork, trans fats, sodas, chips or junk food.
5;Simply AMAZING !!!;This is a most amazing creation. The coconut and almond blend together with such perfection.
5;Quantity;Best of the taco flavorings.  The description is not clear.
1;Not as good as store bought tea bags;The packaging looks the same as the ones you can buy in Asian stores but the tea is weak and lacks the strong body of the store bought bags and it cost more. The only reason I bought it online is the local store didn't have it.
5;Mocha is the best flavored VIA!;I've tried all of the new flavored VIA instant coffees. I am, overall, a bigger fan of the traditional unflavored Colombian VIA, but my second favorite is the Mocha flavor.
1;phony advertising;This is totally insane! I cannot believe you only get one bag. The price is totally not worth it.
5;high quality;A well balanced full bodied balsamic vinegar.  I keep a few extra bottles to share with friends and family.
5;My Decaf of Choice;I don't drink decaf often, but now that I've found this K-cup, that might change. It's very flavorful and actually tastes like quality coffee.
3;good coffee but NOT a 24-pack!!;This variety of coffee came as a sample with my Keurig brewer and I LOVED it, so I ordered this from Amazon. When it arrived today I thought it rattled more than usual so I opened up the carton and dumped them out to count them -- only 22 in the package.
5;Great Morning Wake Up Coffee;This is one of my favorite coffees with the bold flavor.  I get up at 4 am for work and need all the help to get going that I can get.
5;Super Sour;Read some reviews on amazon and decided to go with these because they got good sour ratings.  Man, these things were super sour.
5;love it!!;i love lion bars! my friend's grandma brings them to the u.s.
5;Great choice in popcorn;Great product, probably a couple dollars pricey. I think PURPLE, BABY WHITE and then LADYFINGER were my favorite in that order.
5;Manna from heaven;Stash makes quality teas all the time, but this Peach Black Tea is simply the best.  It makes a heavenly iced tea.
5;Love it for my Rice;I love cooking with this. It gives a different flavor, taste and look for my delicious Basmati rice.
5;Best flavor for Licorice lovers;I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.
5;Glad I gave it a try.;This is a pleasant tasting product, especially for an instant gravy. I also use it to thicken certain recipes with great results.
5;good stuff;How do you review ginger snaps?  Start with these are really good.  Not so hard they break your teeth like some, not so bland you wonder why you're eating them.
5;Addictive! Delicious!;Love Love Love these cookies, but they are addictive, so if you are watching your weight think twice! The cookies came well packaged..
5;Great stuff, it's the only pasta we buy now;Great stuff. Can't tell the difference between this and major brands, which we seldom ate due to our diets.
4;Pretty Good;For out-of-the-boxed, processed-food quick skillet dinners, this one was pretty good! I don't know how they artificially simulated things like the taste of pickles, mustard, and onions, but this definitely tastes like cheeseburger. Sure, it's not healthy, but it's not terrible either (use lean beef).
5;Now in Walmart!;My mother makes this for us, and it's used at family events. This is the ole stand-by when feeding lots of people.
5;Good Ingredients & the Dogs Really Like Them;Both of my dogs love these bars.  They smell good too - like apples.
4;easy to make, tastes very good -- but definitely decadent;I quite liked the flavor of this Rendang Curry Sauce.  I used part of the kit to make a beef curry and the other part to make a chicken curry, and both were delicious.
3;It's water.;"On the bottle's label is the statement ""Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health."" The vagueness of that statement--does it mean that one doctor recommended Essentia as opposed to any other water? Or perhaps that doctors in general acknowledge what everyone knows, namely that water is essential to life?--amused me."
1;OVERPRICED;This food is phenomenal but WAY overpriced. I pay $7.
4;Was ok;I brought this as a gift for a friend. These candies are real small.
5;Pancake batter review;Excellent product especially if you aren't up to full Buckwheat. Milder than regular buckwheat but, still excellent taste and most stores do not carry Buckwheat mixes of any kind.
4;Better than I thought;Actually this is much better than I had originally thought it would be. Im glad I purchased it.
5;Fantastic taste;I purchased both the regular Peanut Butter and the Cocoa Peanut Butter.  I use them both in my energy drinks and they taste great.
3;Piquant Pilaf;Kitchens of India has an overall great line of Indian foods. Unfortunately,the Kashmiri pilaf is mediocre at best.
5;Adult chocolate;I think I've died and gone to heaven.  I have health concerns that keep me from being able to eat sugar/artificial sweetners/caffeine/gluten/some nuts and have had to give up a lot of my previous snacking favorites.
5;Tasty gummies;These taste as good as any gummy.<br />I will try other flavors next time.
4;Amazing chocolates!;As with other reviews I was worried about spending so much on chocolates.  I was entirely taken back at how amazing these chocolates were!  I'm not huge on the chocolates filled with items (Some coconut and one that tasted like banana).
5;Easy & Delicious;We used this to cover about 1000 strawberries for a graduation.  Our group making the chocolate covered strawberries were all Moms, so no professionals.
5;GREAT ENERGY PRODUCT;This is a reorder.  I enjoyed it so much I reordered.
2;Not A Good Espresso;I have been drinking espresso over 20 year and make my own at home.  As a former barista, I expected by the write up on this espresso bean to taste a fantastic espresso and I was totally dissappointed.
5;my baby loves this;This formula totally saved us during the transition from nursing. My third had strong allergies to soy and dairy and when we discoved this fabulous product we were totally relieved.
5;OMG- a MUST BUY;I've never fell in love with chocolate SO MUCH until I bought this particular brand of trouffles..
5;perfect pork rinds!;we used to buy these at an area store and then suddenly they didn't carry them anymore.  THIS is the way to eat pork rinds.
1;Misleading advertisment;They mislead you by saying there are 96 bars in the box , but there just 48 bars in the box.<br />I think this is really bad advertisment.
4;Pretty good.;This is pretty good for a whole bean coffee at a decent price.  I would definitely say that out of the whole flavor line up for the eight o clock brand that this one tastes the best.
5;This is great!;I love the peach flavor. I have bought powdered mix before of peach tea drinks and the tea flavoring was over powering.
5;Healthy Dog at Last;My puppy had a severe diarrhea for weeks until we put her on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato.  Just like a miracle, she is healthy and energetic.
5;Far Exceeds the description and photo;I was sold on the description and photo that one finds in the listing. But upon arrival they do not do it justice.
4;Dog treats;I bought the Sweet Potato Chicken Jerky Twists for my dogs recently and they love them. They really get excited when I get them one from the pantry.
1;melted;I ordered two bags and they are all completely melted. I guess I wont order these again.
5;Delicious;The lemon drops are delicious just like I used to remember. Now have them all over the house in little dishes.
3;Not What I Ordered;I ORDERED TRIDENT SPLASH ORANGE SWIRL WITH THE BANNER NEW BURST OF SWEET INDULGENCE!<br />ON THE TOP. THAT WAS EXACTLY THE PICTURE ON-LINE.
4;Seemed To Work;"I had recently started trying the five hour energy which works well for me when I ran across the six hour energy.<br /><br />Well, like Dolly Parton once said ""If big is good then bigger is better!""  right?<br /><br />In my case, the six hour energy did make me feel peppy but it also made my heart race so I decided not to try it again."
5;tasty & healthy;i think this is quite tasty cereal.  the kamut flakes were just like wheaties or any other standard wheat flakes.
4;Butter toffee peanuts;Basically, they are butter toffee peanuts.  Sweet and crunchy, just like their name.
1;Unhappy;You should disclose when items are not being sold from the US or shipped.  I purchased this as standard delivery with the assumption it was coming from the US not Canada because this was being shipped from Canada it did not fall into the standard shipping guidelines and was not received in time for Christmas NOW i have to take the time to contact the vendor to see if they will accept a return and pay for the shipping - this would cause me NOT to do future purchase on amazon.
5;Great price, great value;Save on money. buy this hot chocolate in bulk.
5;Wonderful bulk deal on cereal!;My son and I absolutely love this cereal, and this deal is actually cheaper per box than at the grocery store.  The box came with in 2 days and was packaged really well.
5;Perfect for Meatless, Gluten-free Cooking;"Manna Soy products have an excellent ""meaty"" texture.  I've used this in wraps, stir-fries, and more, and all with great results."
1;Not too good;"I decided to try a bag at a store first before buying in bulk here - man I am glad I did. I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called ""all purpose flour"" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit."
5;Exelent;This vaniila is the best . It's thick and syrupy.
5;Spicy ginger flavor;I had ginger beer for the first time on vacation in Australia. I enjoyed it very much, and was excited to find Amazon carried ginger beer.
5;Pinnacle Cat Foo;cant get this at my pet store any longer and it's all she'll eat. It arrived quickly and has made her very happy.
5;Yummy!;In a word, this matcha is YUMMY!<br /><br />But, you probably want more than one word, so, I will add a few more!<br /><br />I love the sweet, delicious, creaminess of this flavored matcha.  Sure, I prefer unflavored Matcha most of the time, but sometimes I want to change things up a bit, and I love the selection of flavors that Red Leaf Tea offers, and the flavors are amazingly good.
3;Good flavor, but weak;There's more about Bob Marley on these coffee packets than brewing instructions. There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.
5;The Best Chicken Barz EVER!!!!;ok so i have a dachsund..
5;Buyer Beware;This product is extremely good.  I have been drinking tea for many years and I originally bought this tea with the assumption that it would only be ok.
4;Great Cereal;If you are looking for a healthy, good tasting cereal you should try Kashi's GOLEAN Crunch.  Compared to most healthy (particularly high protein and high fiber) cereals, it has a higher protein and fiber content per serving.
3;The cheese is fantastic - shipping, not so much.;This is the best cheddar cheese in the world, but over $26.00 for shipping?!  Really?!  That's a little much.
5;Calm Review;Natural Vitality's products are excellent and exactly as advertised. It's the best price I have found for Calm.
4;refreshing;This is a rather refreshing take on apple juice.  It has enough tart taste without being bitter or acidic.
2;"Didn't realize it had ""Chia Seed"" in it";My son LOVES the happy baby pouches, so I bought a box of these. I thought the only difference was the size, but these Happy tot pouches have Chia Seed and it REALLY affects the flavor.
5;Great taste;Best tasting true whole wheat pasta we have had. We keep many boxes on hand.
4;Can't Decide;"I was looking to lose a few extra pounds but I LOVE pasta. So I bought this and some <a href=""http://www."
5;Taste like the real thing;These brownies are delicious, period.  I didn't even follow the instructions (forgetting to whip the eggs before I added them) and they turned out wonderful.
4;Super light, quite tasty, overpriced;We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.
1;Adulterated Honey;Thin, bad-tasting honey with a non-natural smell or a strange (sometimes metallic) after-taste has been adulterated with high fructose corn-syrup. This honey meets that description.
2;cheap white chocolate;Unfortunately this tastes like cheap white chocolate you typically buy when everyone and their mother cashes in on manufacturing inexpensive Valentine's, Easter, Christmas or whatever holiday chocolates.  The macadamia nut is fine but the chocolate and the price make this a pass.
4;This is great in shakes;I use this in my protein shakes all of the time! I didn't care for the taste eating it like real peanut butter but it is amazing in my shakes - I just bought the bigger size.  This jar is very small.
5;Please get past the taste.;You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.
5;Great Product;I was raised eating meat substitutes as my mother, now 86 with no cardio vascular problems, has been a vegetarian from birth.  This product is delicious.
5;Great!;This is the only coffee my wife and I drink with our Keurig. The butter toffee has a very mellow taste.
5;favorite tea!;This has long been my favorite tea!  It's gotten me through many a stressful day.  I hope they never quit making it.
5;Marcel Proust All-Star Team;Everybody who misses New Orleans misses something special about New Orleans. But how is this possible? You can find every one of everybody's special memories in a cup of Cafe du Monde Coffee.
5;Earl Grey;Very tasty tea.  It was cheaper to buy it and bulk, and now I don't have to hunt through all of the stores in my town to find it.
5;Finally a dog treat that our dog actually likes;We've tried a number of different types of treats for our dog, who has remained steadfastly indifferent to most of them.  She has generally preferred table scraps as treats instead of treats marketed for dogs.
5;Great tasting coffee!;I'm really surprised that it's just as good as the caffinated coffee I've been drinking for years. Being organic and water processed is what sold me.
3;does not ship well;This product has a good taste but was melted and stuck to the wrapper.  It made a mess getting it out of the wrapper.
5;Love Coffee?;This is a very flavorful decaf, and we are very happy with this choice. This was a reasonably priced product.
5;Happy Dog;This is a healthy and good snack for my dog.  It is a great training produst too.
4;Not what I expected;I never buy flavored coffee.  I'm a cream, sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker.
5;Great ingredients and quality product;So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly.
5;portable & yummy in the tummy;My kids are 5 & 3 1/2 and are pretty much over Cheerios these days. A few days a month they eat a light breakfast in the car so I researched (heavily!) a snack that was both very healthy (really healthy, not vitamins and minerals in Lucky Charms healthy) and special/unique and delicious.
5;100 Calorie Satisfaction;I have eaten the full size bar many times - love the taste and the satiety it provided, but never really cared for the 180 calories..
5;The best chocolate I've ever had!;This chocolate is high-quality chocolate. It isn't too sweet, and the taste is extraordinary.
5;Works for Our Golden;I'm very happy with this food. Our Golden Ret was on it a year and her weight is excellent, beautiful coat, and firm stool.
5;Good stuff!;This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.
5;Quick and inexpensive;I live in a very rural area. There is a store about 15 miles away that sells Alvita teas.
5;A healthy, somewhat expensive food.;"These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many ""stories"" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein."
5;Cats LOVE this!;I have a cat-care business.  A few months ago a vet gave me a package of these treats.
3;greasy;After trying and not liking the Spirulina flavor, I compared the nutritional data of all RR bars and specifically chose the Raspberry flavor for its lowest fat content. I still find it too greasy to enjoy it.
5;great drink for pumping out..;Great drink for working out. I was paying $5 at 24 hour for each drink now got a case of them for cheap.
3;Not the best;With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short.
5;Try this coffee if you like Vanilla flavoring;This is just a delightful coffee.  My husband and I are fans of flavored coffee, particularly vanilla and hazelnut.
4;Good;I use this to make red velvet cupcakes, very nice color. Worth buying here compared to the supermarket which is I think a little bit pricey.
2;Not happy with this product;I have a great amount of experience with water kefir
5;Coffee;Showed up on time and was as described. This came with a wide variety and all of it was very delicious, would definatly order again.
5;RAW Cocoa Butter;I love this RAW COCOA BUTTER!!!  Once it is melted down and mixed with a little extra virgin olive oil, it's second to none! It's GREAT for any type of skin repair and/or maintenance.  It feels so-ooOh smooth and silky and best of all, after only a few applications my skin felt and looked like a baby's too.
5;Yummy!!;love this rice! its very delicious and the aroma is outstanding. grain length are perfect, I had no issues.
4;Good 'shrooms;Nice big pieces, flavorful, and absolutely clean. I would buy this product again, especially since it's a lot cheaper than the porcini's in my local grocery.
5;Good taste and good for your baby;I am not a health nut but I have tried various brands of baby food and by far Earth's Best tastes and smells better.<br /><br />My son loves it and he is a very picky eater.
4;Convenient and nutritious.;The kashi cereals are really tasty. This handy prepackaged version is nice to have on hand to take to work or school.
5;Deliciously addictive treat;For anyone who is curious about plantains, it is a tropical product.  It is in the family of bananas, however, unlike eating a ripened banana, plantains must be cooked, whether in the green or yellow skin.
3;Wellness Review Turkey/Salmon;We've been purchasing direct from retail stores, either PetSmart or Felix & Oscar's in Springfield, VA.  The condition of the cans shipped was not as good as I would have hoped.
5;My favorite;I have tried many k-kup varieties and this is my favorite.  Mild, perfect for someone who likes a mellow coffee.
5;love it;Honey water is good for your health.<br /><br />And this is a good product,easy to pour out and won't have resides sticking to the outside of the bottle.
5;Favorite Granola;For years I've made my own mix of granola, and then I discovered this, which is almost exactly what I was mixing up myself. The nuggets have just the right crunch, and the chocolate pieces tend to be stuck in the middle, which keeps your fingers from getting melted chocolate on them if you're munching on it as a snack.
5;Goodness Indeed!;My dogs are picky eaters, but this one is a hit! I usually mix it with a premium dry dog food and they gobble it up without hesitation
5;Yummy and Healthy;I love this product. It is very healthy for you and tastes REALLY good.
5;Excellent, AMERICAN MADE, nothing imported;"I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called ""made here."
5;Always great quality;I've learned to trust that with Bob's Red Mill I will get very good quality every time. This makes really flavorful and nicely textured polenta.
5;This Made My Day;After searching high and low for some kind of snack food bar to stash in my purse that wasn't chock full of soy, hydrogenated oils and other nasty things I gave these a go - and I was amazed!<br /><br />These are delectable - really almost like eating candy, only good for you. I tried about four different flavors so far and have liked them all.
5;Super yummy!;I found these at a store quite a distance from home.  I was happy to find them on amazon.
5;My Number two tea;There are two black teas that I consider delicious, PG tips and Typhoo.  PG tips is a bit milder than Typhoo.
4;You'll go bananas;I love having a Larabar for breakfast each day. The banana bread flavor is delicious and full of healthy fruit and nuts, but after eating the whole pack, I was a little tired of it.
5;Great bones.;Our dogs love these bones. We have five dogs, three labs and two rescue terrier mixes.
5;5 Stars for Choc. Chip Flavor ONLY, Oatmeal deserves 2 stars...;Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.
1;Walden Farms Peanut Spread;When I first opened the jar it smelled like some chemical, not peanuts.  I got past that and tried some and it was disgusting.
5;If you love radishes...;..
5;Yummy!;I love these little logs of MEAT!<br /><br />I've almost demolished the first one.<br /><br />Usually I go the sharp cheddar, salami, and crackers route<br />but I've been slicing these babies onto whole wheat, mustard, miracle whip for a tangy treat.
5;Shirataki Oodles Of Noodles, Tofu-Styled;I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.
5;Crack.;I will never understand why I can get almost all the Haribo products in the world at my local bodega with the notable exception of the amazing Primavera. Take back your Happy-Cola.
5;As close to a miracle as you can get;Incredible product. We had unbelievable results after 2 weeks of use.
5;SESAKISS SESAME SEEDS;Haven't order for a while but are as good as ever.  Product came promptly and was as advertised.
5;The old girl is happy;My 20+ yr old particular cat devoures this stuff. Believe it or not this cat refused to eat Blue Buffalo cat food.
5;Cat Tested, Owner Approved;We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers.
5;Francesco Rinaldi Traditional Unsalted Pasta Sauce;This is an excellent product that proves that you don't have to overload pasta sauce with salt to get great flavor.  This sauce has virtually no salt per serving, compared with 600-800mg for a typical sauce.
5;This is my favorite;This jerky is some of the tastiest stuff I've ever had.  I could sit and eat the whole jar.
5;good alternative;This stuff is great! No more sugar for me! It's not as sweet, so you do have to use more, but that's okay. I'll buy this again.
5;Great Chips but Slow Shipping and Quick Expiration Date;I love these chips which is why I bought them in bulk. My only disappointment was that they were not shipped until 5-6 days after I placed the order so it took about 1.
5;Mallomars are my favorite cookie. But mail ordering them has its problems.;Mallomars are my favorite cookie. But mail ordering them has its problems.
5;Our favorite sushi ginger;This Roland Sushi Ginger is my husband's favorite by far. I also think it tastes the best.
5;Hands down new FAVORITE;I do not lie when I say one of my 4 cats is hunting me down to him more of these treats as I type this.  I usually give my cats (age range 2yrs-15yrs) Whisker Lickins, but my 15 yr old female can't really eat them due to sensitive teeth.
5;Tasty, and perfect sized.;I was surprised at the size of these potatoes. I have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small.
2;Whatever this tastes like it isn't a chocolate chip cookie;I'm trying to figure out what it is that tastes so very peculiar and unpleasant in these cookies. Could it be the soy flour? In any case, I get no taste of chocolate chips at all.
1;Didn't Care For This K-Cup At All!!!;I received one of these in a sampler package I had ordered of different flavored coffees from the Official Keurig.com website.
5;loved it;great product.  actually we've used it all now.
5;Shake it on everything;Pappy's is a perfect addition to anything. Especially any meat cooked on the grille.
5;Espresso;I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste.
4;My hair is clean.;"After I chose this product for ""Vine"" I realized that it will take way more than one bottle of shampoo to determine whether it decreased breakage, unless I count the hairs in my brush before and after using it.  I used it and it worked like shampoo."
5;The Best Chili Seasoning!;I've tried all of the chili seasonings and McCormick is definitely the best. McCormick Chili seasoning makes the best chili that I've ever tasted.
4;Great, considering I usually prefer a light/medium roast;I got one K-Cup of Wolfgang Puck's Colombian Reserve dark roast as part of a variety 35-pack that I bought here on Amazon. Since I'd always assumed that I preferred the less-burnt flavor of a light or medium roast, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the way this coffee sat on my tongue.
4;Easy to do party treats;I filled them with chocolate mousse topped with a raspberry. Just make them a la carte since they easily get soggy.
1;Salty;"This product (Noodle soup) has too much salt in it.<br /><br />Let's ssee more ""lower salt"" items."
5;Great tea combination;I love Disney sets of tea and this one is no different. This set of 3 has the ideal combination for each day: earl grey in the morning, mad tea party for the afternoon and lemon honey chamomile for the evening.
5;Sugar Free Honey;I buy this by the case.  Great for diabetics.
5;Real cultured butter of high quality;I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.
1;I wanted to like this TEA;I wanted a mental boost by something else than caffeine and I was enthusiastic to love this Tea but after tasting it for the fifth time I quit. It really taste bad.
4;Not a bad healthy snack;This oat cluster snack is pretty tasty, though it's not something I would want to snack on all the time.  The flavor tastes like a mild cinnamon.
4;Good but chewy-very very chewy!;These bars have a very fresh tart taste due to the cranberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. These taste wonderful and the ingredient list is relatively short and contains a lot of really healthy things (in addition to the fruits: chia seeds, almonds, peanuts, and sunflower seeds).
5;Earth's Bestest!;My 4 month old LOVES squash and she started out with Gerber. But then I found that EB sells them in a pack of 12 for $11, while Gerber sells them in a pack of 8 for $10.
5;Won't be disappointed;"I first tried this as a gift from a co-worker. I like that it's all natural and that it's actually ""leaves"" and not the powder they sell in the supermarkets."
5;Pop Chips...Yum!!!;These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree.
5;It works for dry skin!!;I purchased the 15 oz size container of the Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil because I was looking for something that would help me deal with my dry skin symptoms based on other reviews and product info.  I thought why not give it a try nothing else seems to be working.
2;about 10% of 2 different orders of this brand, arrived damaged;I ordered a large shipment of these and out of 40-odd bags, 15 were punctured, not sealed, and un usable..
5;Good tortillas;These are great. I bought them at my local vons.
1;Not the same as the original;This tea with new packaging does not have the same great taste as the original.  The flavor is less pronounced and more bitter.
1;"NOT a ""coffee only"" sampler pack";"While I am pleased with most of the product ordered, I specifically ordered a ""coffee only"" sampler pack and received many non-coffee k-cups (ciders, hot chocolates, cappuccinos, teas) which will end up thrown away. So I'm throwing away about 25% of what I ordered."
5;Makes a good iced latte;I brew this over ice with the espresso setting on the Keuring B90 and add a little milk.  Nice bold flavor.
5;Best Kitty Cookies Ever;My kitties love these. Other Goodlife treats are good.
2;Makes a weak cup of tea;I was so excited to find Lavender Earl Grey since I had enjoyed a delicious one in the past, but this brand makes a very weak cup of tea.  Maybe next time I will get a high quality loose leaf Earl Grey and add my own lavender.
5;Great-tasting green tea;I've been looking for a green tea I like, knowing all the reported benefits of green tea. This one's perfect for me because it's got a little berry taste to make it interesting.
4;Good tasting coffee;I got the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee, Brooklyn Bridge Blend coffee taste very good. I went thru about 15 K-Cups 5 of them brewed very very week.
5;GREAT DEAL!;The local places want around $40 for a small bonsai like this, so this was a great deal. I wasn't sure how they would ship it to me and have it survive, but it did.
5;A Cats Love It;I have three cats that are picky eaters.  They like a very small number of cat foods, but this is one type they do enjoy.
5;Best pimenton in the world;I like to use pimenton in a wide variety of foods and my first contact with this smoked sweet pimenton De la Vera, was because a friend give me one can about 3 years ago, and I felt that he was giving me that can even with pain, like if he was loosing something very valuable. When I tried the first time in an omelette I discover that: is not an excellent product .
1;Jet Fuel K - Cups,  not the best....;I buy K-Cups from Amazon regularly but the Jet Fuel Cup are not very good..
5;Buffalo Bill's Beef Jerky;Buffalo Bill's Beef Jerky<br /><br />Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.
1;MSG In Ranch;"This product has MSG in it. I felt stupid because after all the "" Naturally helps absorb vitamins A & E"
1;Not Good;Sorry I ate this..
3;good but not the very tasty;This is good as it doesnt have any sugars added. However i found young brand coconut juice better, it does have sugars added though.
2;You get what you pay for;This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.
5;Super;"I use these to place the children's new sight words for the week inside. I call their sight words ""popcorn"" words."
4;THE REAL DEAL!!;"I was skeptical about this at first because I had purchased coconut oil from another supplier and it had ""no"" smell at all.."
4;The best option out there;I didn't use organic for my older kids, as it wasn't really available then.  With # 3, it was a must.
5;You will eat the whole box.;I love this toffee and buy it for friends during the holidays. It is the best toffee, buttery, crunchy sweet goodness.
1;Don't waste you money.;These are cheaply made toothpicks that are overpriced. The coloring on the toothpicks is uneven.
1;Made In Mexico!  :-(;My husband just read on the box that Raisin Bran is now made in Mexico. I was shocked.
5;Greenie Review;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;My daughter loves this;My 14 month old loves these pouches and it's a great way of getting broccoli into her diet.  she just started being able to do it herself recently, although it's sometimes messy.
2;Disappointed--;I found these to have a stale taste and were quite hard.<br />I got these a week ago and the expiration date says April but they tasted pretty old.
3;peach extract;It wasn't what I expected, but that was probably my fault.  I just want to flavor non-carbonated water.
4;Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste;I initially received the incorrect item when I ordered this.  The company was very prompt to send out a replacement with the correct item.
5;Great product.;I absolutely love this salt.  The flavor is awesome and at a great price.
5;Best Barbecue flavor!;I'm addicted to these things!  They have the best BBQ flavor of any chip I've ever tried!  And SO low in fat and calories.  A single  serving is almost a full cereal bowl.
4;Really Bold!;If you like a really bold coffee, this one's for you.  I personally think it's too bold but our son thinks it's hard to beat.
4;Great peanuts!;These are great peanuts, big, crisp, fresh and yummy.  The only thing I could possibly say in the negative is that the packaging is a bit inconvenient.
4;Not worth the price/ But they are good;I Bake these cookie and like them but I can do the same thing with a cheap box for gluten-free cookie mix and blender oatmeal. There was nothing special about this mix.
3;Best price...;"I'm not sure how much I like this product because I'm always a little concerned our puppies might choke on the Greenies which tend to be a bit small.  When it comes to oral hygiene, I actually prefer the CET chews:  <a href=""http://www."
5;Dare Crackers;This is one of the best products I have found on the market. I can only get it at one store in my area and most of the time they are out of it.
2;not all that...;We love demerara sugar in tea, however, this left us terribly disappointed!  The sugar arrived hard - had to run it through the blender just to loosen it enough to be useable (but then it's powdery and not good for baking with).<br />I'll never order this again - we went back to our favorite brand (Tate & Lyle) just wish that amazon carried it.
5;The Best Tasting Mocha Frappe I've Ever Tasted!;I'm extremely picky when it comes to coffe flavor, but I loved this frappe blend. The coffee flavor isn't overwhelming or bitter.
1;This is nasty;I tried a bottle today and it was a waste of money. I drank the whole bottle and it tasted very gross, I almost gagged on the aftertase even though I chased it with water.
5;Great for recipes, hard to get at stores.;Knorr leek soup mix makes the best chip and veggie dip
1;Didn't work for me...;"I'm very open to new flavors and tastes, but I had a rough time with these.  I put a small amount in a miso soup and the ""bouncy"" texture was less than appetizing."
5;Great healthier chip snack;Great for a change in tortilla chips. Tasty and not bland like some blue chips.
3;1 of 5 Kups Breaks;Great rich flavor. Long time user but a 25%<br />breakage rate-never had cups do this before.
5;Sunbutter Natural;I have tried various nut/seed spreads from different makers of such products. This is my personal favorite.
2;Disappointing;This didn't last more than a couple of days.  My 30 lb.
5;Good food and nutritious;This Bulgur wheat is filling, tasty and very good. I use it as a hot cereal in the morning and sometimes for dinner.
5;Very Good Stout;For not boiling any ingreidients this is a great beer. Just add some hot water, syrup, malt, sugar, pitch the yeast and let ferment.
5;The BEST green tea.;THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.
5;GREAT!!!;I love these seeds!  I have been buying them in the store for a awhile.  I eat them everyday, perfect to snack on while watching TV or reading a book.
2;Step in the wrong direction;I've been drinking coconut water for years and I've tried them all ONE, Vita Coco, Naked, etc..
5;Great Mommy Afternoon Pick me Up!;I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360. I have never tried this product before but had seen commercials of the product on tv.
4;Good stuff as coffee replacement;I have tried Teeccino Hazelnut and , while it does not taste much like coffee, it is a great morning hot beverage. I use 2 tablespoons and make on mug of the brew and use some maple syrup sweetner.
2;hmmm, just did not hit the taste buds right;1st, i really do like the BLACK licorice and rate it at a 5..
5;Our favorite!;This salad dressing has solved our problem.  My husband likes very salty dressings and I less salty but flavorful.
4;Delicious, but a little pricey;I LOVE THIS SNACK =D Its like eating crunchy chips but they're sweet and so much healthier. I would eat them all the time, but they just add up- but don't most healthy foods? Sad truth :(.
5;memories;You get 24 bags in the case. I remember this vintage '70's candy very well, 30 years ago I used to love to buy it and nibble at the tiny nuggets of gum.
5;Yummy!;This product is very delicious and very good for you.  Great for a quick lunch.
3;Delicious, but fattening;Good sauce..
5;Awesome treat;My cat loves these. I break off many pieces for him every night and he thinks it's the greatest thing ever.
3;I gave it a shot;There was a coupon for this so I purchased it instead of Orgain. It's not bad but I prefer the taste of Orgain.
5;Great coffee!;I had tried this coffee before and found it to still be a of the same quality and satisfaction.  Just happy to discover Amazon had it is stock.
5;Yummy;The amarena cherries are delicious.  We needed them for a particular cocktail we were making and they were perfect, added just the right touch.
5;Tea Time;The ease at which you can make a cup of fresh iced tea is nothing short of amazing. Cost effective.
5;Love Bob's Red Mill Products & Tasty Blue Cornmeal;I have never been disappointed when ordering Bob's Red Mill products. I bought this blue cornmeal to make a fun bread machine recipe that calls for blueberries and blue cornmeal.
2;a Clearer explanation;"First of all, what is in the box? A bag of white cake mix, a pouch of pink frosting mix, 1 plastic pastry bag for frosting and 12 pre-printed strips of cardboard. The ""aprons"" are the cardboard strips."
4;Taste;This product has a very good taste.  It was a replacement for an item that we bought in Florida that is no longer made.
4;better than the national brand;Organic, tasty, not much else to say about these cookies except that they are delicious and I love putting them in desserts, or eating them alone. My only complaint is that the boxes are kind of small compared to the national brand, but taste and health factor make up for it.
4;Fair deal;My periodic trip to costco (2-5x a year) happened 2 weeks after I got this from amazon<br />Slim jims from amazon:<br />firm, snap present, mail ordered<br /><br />slim jims from costco:<br />Slightly cheaper, over 100ct, some soft, snap varied, weaved thru lines of people at local costco.<br /><br />Both boxes were recently packaged.
5;Not your typical catfood.......;We have two cats in our family. One will try just about anything the other one typically will only eat dry food.
4;My kitty's favorite canned food!;My 2 Scottish fold kitties love this food and never tire of it.  The cans are a small size, perfect for 2 cats and the food is nicely mixed with sufficient liquid to make it easy for them to eat.
5;FruitChia;These FruitChia bars are delicious & nutritious! We have ordered them a few times, and share them with friends. They like them as well.
4;Once you've got the texture down, good stuff.;(Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through..
5;Butcher and Packer is the best;Had purchased from Butcher and Packer some years ago, and most recently became pleased to re-order a variety of different spices from themselves.<br />Package arrived very prompt, shipped very good condition,and each pound of spice packaged very professionally separated from the next.
5;Tastes Like I'm Cheating!;Judy's Sugar Free Peanut Brittle was so good that I kicked myself for only ordering one package.  Anyone who likes peanut brittle but cannot have sugar should order this since it's just like the real thing.
5;Pure Org Hibiscus Flowers;I was 100% satisfied with my purchase of Davidson's Pure Org Hibiscus Flowers from Amazon. I had read that drinking hibiscus tea can help lower your blood pressure.
5;I love this salt;I love pink himalayan salt! It is loaded with minerals and taste great.  I don't have to use as much as the conventional table salt and I don't feel bad about using it because I know that it's also really good for my body.
1;Made in China! My dog got very sick...;"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water."
5;Drink The Spirit of Aloha!;I purchased these for my mom and she loves them!  She does not like bold coffee flavors, but is more into the sweet and more flavorful varieties.  This one combines the taste of the islands with a smooth, nutty flavor.
5;One of the best;Was happy to see Amazon carry this granola - at one to two dollars a bag cheaper than what I typically see at the store.  Even as a single guy, six bags aren't going to last that long.
5;Great product;I was very pleased that my elderly cat liked this food.  He is a VERY picky eater.
5;So yummy!  Love these bars!;I just got done with the HCG diet so I was looking for a bar that was low in sugar (I actually ate these in P3 and did not gain weight).  I love coconut and I absolutely love these bars!  I have tried all of them except the one with nuts and my favorite is the Classic because I like that is has more chocolate.
5;Wow these are good.;I'm going to echo the general concensus and say these are awesome.  Perfect texture without being terribly heavy and overly sweet like a big ol' chocolate chip cookie might be.
5;Martinson Dark Roast;I have been drinking Martinson Dark Roast for five days now and have been very impressed with the flavor profile. This is the closest K-Cup style product to traditional pot brewed coffee that i have tried.
5;Guest's Glory;I have enjoyed herbal teas for many years.  Several years ago my wife and I started to entertain groups in our home.
5;Passed my test;It was very important to me to find an alternative to wheat based bread crumbs.  I am big on cooking since I have a specialized diet.
3;Decent on the taste buds but high in calories and poor value;I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program. I am not a fan of soda pop.
4;Cats love this stuff;My cats love this grass.  It is easy to grow.
5;Amazing yogurt bar.;It is so good for you. Filling.
4;Tart but tasty;These drinks are pretty tasty a bit on the tart side but not too sweet which is nice in the current market of way to sweet beverages. I'll be trying more of the flavors fo these drinks.
5;Perfect snack;I think i found something to enjoy with my lunch.The cinnamon taste is<br />right on the money.
3;there has been a recent change;I have been purchasing chocolate fudge orgain for over a year now and I have always loved it. Recently, the taste is different and does not taste as good.
5;The choice of fundraiser BBQs everywhere!;Cornell Chicken marinade was developed more than 50 years ago at Cornell University to help chicken producers in NY State sell more chicken. The logic seemed to be that making chicken taste more delicious would entice people to eat more of them.
4;Not actually Amish popcorn...;"I just want to point out that this is not actually ""Amish"" popcorn.  Look at the company's website-this is ""Amish country"" popcorn, meaning I guess that Amish live in the vincinity."
5;Love this when I'm sick;This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it.
2;My Dog LOVED it BUT;My dog is a very picky eater and she loves this dog food so I thought I hit the jackpot. However, after looking at the ingredients I have found that I have NOT hit the jackpot.
5;Good price;The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good.
4;A light confection;The 2.54 ounce package is too big to use as an individual serving, but contains 10 individual wafers that must be carefully broken apart.
2;Too Dry - Causes my dog to cough;This is very dry and brittle.  My dog started coughing as soon as he ate it the first time so I am not giving him any more.
5;Weight to calorie ratio;Wafer is light weight but a package of french vanilla packs over 200 calories!  Weight to calorie ratio is important while hiking/backpacking.  This bar is lighter than most power bars on the market and tastes DELICIOUSLY like a desert!<br /><br />I only tried the vanilla flavor therefore I can't recommend other flavor but I am heading to my local Trader Joe's to get cookie n cream and the berry flavor to try (am tired of the chocolate and peanut butter varieties among all the energy bars).
4;max's faviorite;my dog is a picky  snacker.  Turns his nose up at many things ( like rachel Ray's new dog snack-)  this one is a winner.
4;Jury's Still Out On This One;"Hmm, I'm waiting for the day that I will love this bread.  Right now I'm calling it Lembas (sp?) bread because a little corner of it is all I, um, ""need"" before I've had enough of it."
5;My picky eater gobbles these up.;My dog routinely spits out the chewable tablets and/or manages to eat around them when I try to hide them in her meals.  I mash the tablets and mix them into her meals and she ddoesn't seem to notice, however mashing the tablets and dosing the food, although not a huge effort, was quickly replaced with these biscuits once I found my dog actually likes the biscuits.
4;Great but would not ship them in the summer;This product is awesome. The only problem is that I would not have them shipped in the summer!  They can only take temperatures of 100 degrees or more for 24 hours.
5;Yummy sauce!;This sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy.  I love it with eggrolls, rice, just about anything that needs an extra kick.
5;Mapley Birthday;I ordered this for my son for his birthday. He and his son love the gooooood maple syrup, and the Vermont maple syrup is the best quality.
1;Terrible! Don't Buy!;Worst tasting beef jerky I have ever had.  Beef is bad and flavoring is terrible.
5;LOVE THIS STUFF !!!;This is one of the best hot sauces out there, it simply goes so well with everything, soups, pasta, chicken, snack dips, sandwiches.  The flavor is great, and it only has like 3 ingredients, which makes it nice and simple for those who avoid the list of 20 unpronounceable preservatives.
1;A Great Product Ruined by Misguided Marketing;I have used this formerly terrifc product for over 10 years.  It was the only canned chicken sold in North America that contained no food additives.
5;Unbelievable - healthy and incredibly tasty;YUM - what can I say. I am a sucker for BBQ chips and these really taste delicious, especially for something that is good for you.
2;too bitter;I like chocolate in my coffee.<br />But this chocolate is so bitter-sweet, you can't even taste it.
4;Hard to find, but really good;Out of all the Betty Crocker Bowl Appetit varieties, I like this one the best.  Unfortunately it is hard to find so I bought a case on Amazon.
5;YUMMY!;These are really tasty.  I used to always eat the normal cereal before all the marshmallows so I could have just the marshmallows alone in the end.
5;Happy Pup, Happy Mom!;My lab mix with hip dysplasia and a sensitive stomach was happy to see the large box of treats come through the door.  They are easy on his stomach and certainly can't help in aiding his hips.
5;Gluten Free - The way to be!;I have many of the Pure Pantry products. I bought them at Jimbo's and have been very happy with them.
5;Tasty chips;These are good chips.  I like the texture and that they are easier to chew than regular tortilla chips.
5;My Dog Loves Them!;My little Chihuahua and Jack Russell mix just loves these! She gobbles them up! They are a perfect size for her small mouth. According to her, they are very tasty.
3;Pink Himalayan Salt Brick;"Very interesting concept. Our brick was about 10"" x 4"" x 3"", pretty thick compared to the slabs others have or commented about."
5;Great product!;I had been using this primarily for baking, but today I gave it the ultimate taste test! My 8 year old nephew asked for a glass of milk & with no fanfare,  I gave him a glass of this.  He drank it up without a word - I don't think he even realized it wasn't his regular milk.
4;Great Flavored Coffee;Who doesn't like Dark Chocolate Truffle? Mixed together with a bold Gevalia coffee, you can't go wrong. Try this today or surprise your family near the holidays with this special treat.
4;My Doctor Recommended this product;My doctor recommended this product to lower my cholestorol.  Works great!  Taste is just like a caramel chew.
4;Delicious holiday coffee!;This is a really nice coffee to have around during the holidays.  It has a festive taste, although I agree with other reviewers the pumpkin does not have a strong presence, if any at all.
1;Terrible;I wished I had checked out reviews prior to purchasing..
4;KIND Nuts & Spices Bars;This was a new-to-me product.  I REALLY enjoyed it.
4;My Dogs Love It!;Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.
5;oatmeal with a crunch.;I like this oatmeal.  It isn't mushy, it has a nice crunch.
3;Dog loved it;
2;Not Mastiff proof;Bone looked great, length was great, BUT my Mastiff managed to chew joint ends off and then started getting shards of bone.  Had to remove it and throw it away.
4;Nice Taste, Good Company;This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine.
5;A great whole grain breakfast cereal!!;I bought this as a special lightning deal price.  McCann's makes steel cut oats that are among the best.
1;Not so good......;I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does.  It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland).
5;Great for sensitive cats;I switched to this cat food randomly--Whole Foods was out of the Halo brand cat food I had been buying, and this was the next best option they sold.  I'm really glad I switched though! My 2 cats used to vomit up their food once or twice a week, and never liked the Halo brand food.
4;Not really 4 million scovilles;This hot sauce has an excellent taste, unlike most of Dave's Insanity sauces. I put 6-10 drops into a bowl of mild chili to make it hot.
5;What is in these kitten party treats?;My four cats were all very enthusiastic about the taste and crunch of these kitten treats.  This is extraordinary for them to show such enthusiasm for such a little morsel.
5;Yum!;I love, love, love the Salt & Pepper Popchips. Have to order them in the individual bags or I will eat the whole thing!!  Thank goodness for portion control :-) 1 bag is only 2 points on WW.
4;Almost as good as the real thing;"I love coconut water, specially directly from the coconut. But this is the first packaged coconut water that passed my ""quality control"", I really enjoy it."
4;Yummy Gummis;These are very very tasty and they are all individually wrapped.<br /><br />My only problem with the candy's is that out of the 12 bags they send they double up on some of the less popular flavors and leave out a few of the other flavors.
3;Not as good as others that I've brought!~;Not as good as others that I've brought!~ Very Pricey and the bag does not seal that tight..
1;Too pricy;28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.
5;My son LOVES these!;"Just amazing! My son actually laughs, smiles and waves his arms and legs around when he sees the container! These are the ONLY thing to give to a baby for their first ""hard"" food. They dissolve easily, and are very easy for a little one with only a few teeth to practice chewing."
5;Bully bully;Great job as usual. Got here in a very short time.
5;The best green tea;My husband and I have been drinking this delicious tea for the past couple of years and even take it with us when we go on vacation.  Everywhere we go people comment on how delicious it smells - must be the lemongrass.
5;Miracle Honey!;"I was a huge skeptic that this was just some scam ""natural cure that they don't want you to know about"" type thing.  But, I was desperate and so I tried it."
5;Excellent for Pressure Fried Chicken;I have been looking for a good batter mix for my pressure fryer and found it!!  I used to buy the mix from Pro-Selections, but it was expensive.  4 bags for $30!  It was good but I noticed it said it was mixed for them.
5;Douwe Egberts coffee available at BK;My husband and I enjoy an occasional Croisandwich at Burger King.  Recently, we noticed that their coffee was outstanding.
4;Rich, dark roast coffee........;"I was given a Keurig coffee brewer for Christmas 2008, since receiving it I have tried many different kinds and brands of coffee.  I'm still trying to find my ""favorite"", since I like so many of them!  This one is delicious if you like a dark robust cup of coffee."
5;Fast Service, Great Tasting Product;I ordered the hibiscus tea based on information that drinking two cups per day would help reduce blood pressure.  I have not been to the doctor yet to see if this working.
4;Delicate!;So i got this here turkish delight box. These are in my opinion a step away from your average turkish delight (not that i am a seasoned T.
5;Best gum ever!;It'll be a year next week that I quit smoking. Instead of a cigarette, I reach for this gum! Only the Green Apple will do.
5;Doing the right thing;This is a great product for those of us that want to kick start the day without the extra poundage. My first order was flawless.
5;Beautiful plant, but NOT Miss Beauty;I had ordered the Miss Beauty Desert Rose.  According to the picture, the flower clearly has red boarders with a distinct white center.
4;My Dog Loves The Beef 1oz Beef Steaks;I have a border collie and my husband started to give our dog a jacks beef steak every night as a treat. Now I buy boxes of 24 all the time and the vet says they are better to give then a raw hide or some of the treats in the stores .
5;Great for trainning;Excellent trainning treats. My dogs love them and they learn new tricks very easily, also good behavior.
5;Love this rice!!;I just love this rice, so much healthier and tastier than plain rice.  The texture is chewy and the flavor is nutty.
5;Fantastic coffee;This is my new go-to coffee. It's extremely smooth and has a great earthy flavor (almost with a slight hint of chocolate), is reasonably priced for what it is, and because it's not that oily (medium roast), it works great in my grind and brew coffee machine.
5;very convenient and tasty;Bought this first at Costco, my Costco no longer stocks it -- I usually make all my own soups, but find this a convenient addition if I'm out of potatoes or want to thicken some gravy.  Wouldn't use it as is out of the container -- too salty.
5;Love this;I love this drink. Its a bit sweet and thick for me, so I do a 60juice/40water mix and it lasts longer, and tastes better.
5;I'm Usually a Coffee Drinker - Until;I'm a coffee-a-holic and darned proud of it. However recently I've been in the mood for tea.
1;Cute Dinosaur Not Cute Dog Teeth;When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges.
5;Truly the best!;As someone who has been at this for a very long time..
5;LOVE these chips!;These Kettles bake chips are the best!  They taste like fried chips, but they're not, so much healthier for you.  I have trouble finding them in stores, so I've started buying them on Amazon by the case.
5;Doctor Recommended;My doctor recommended this supplement.  It seems to really help me, so I hope it will also help you as well.
5;Best Energy Booster EVER!!!!!;This product is no joke definitely the best of its kind.  I prefer ACAI the most, but both pink and orange flavors are all amazing.
5;dental dog chews;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Better for you than candy;I can't really say that these candies are giving me any more energy than I would get from having a Starburst, however, they do contain some vitamins and are caffeine free.  I have been taking one every afternoon as a pick-me-up instead of buying some garbage, and eating just one piece seems to do the trick.
4;My cat;My cat loves this things. He waits for me to come home and then assumes a place next to my chair, waiting for me to open the bucket and give him some.
3;OK Flavor.  Mimics Sweet Tea, But Not Quite the Same.;MIO Sweet Tea tastes somewhat like sweet tea once you put about 3 healthy squirts into a regular size water bottle.  With the amount of squirts necessary to produce the sweet tea flavor (tastes like tea, but not overly sweet), I doubt that the MIO bottle will actually have enough liquid to flavor 24 water bottles.
5;SNACK PACK;I REALLY ENJOYED THIS PRODUCT.  ALL THE ITEMS IN THIS VARIETY PACK WERE LIKES FOR ME WHICH WERE A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
5;Taste great, soft to chew;Taste like carmels except softer.  Ingredients:  Sugar, Corn Syrup, Plant Stanol Estrs, Nonfat Milk, less than 2% of Caramel color, Soy lecithin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, and yellow 6.
4;Good tasting product;When these cookies are fresh and not overbaked, they are delicious.  They melt in your mouth, and the chocolate and chocolate chips are very chocolatey.
1;Are you serious?;At this price and you expect to sell these?..
5;Great Flavor & Variety;Great flavor and variety as my husband and I prefer different types of coffee.  We will definitely be ordering another box.
5;This food is working shockingly well for our allergy prone pug.;We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems.  We've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural, Chicken Soup for the dog lover's soul, Royal Canin, and a couple others that I can't remember off the top of my head.
5;Awesome Tea;An excellent tea from Canada.  I could only find two makers and to get the same tea from the other maker the cost was triple including shipping.
5;Delish!;These Lara bars are absolutely delicious!  A great healthful alternative to a candy bar.  The cookie dough flavor tastes much like real cookie dough without the harmful sugars and artificial flavorings.
5;Love em;I bought these because I wanted something with fiber and not containing chocolate.  They are very good tasting.
5;Love the Half-Caff!;I love the Green Mountain Half Caff K-cups. It is a great tasting cup of coffee, never bitter.
1;Don't waste your money;These are supose to be turkey, cranberry and pumpkin pie flavors.  The only one that tasted close to it's description was the pumpkin pie.
4;Dog Treat;Very happy with the product and shipping.  Thanks.
5;Not just for diabetics;I am not a diagnosed diabetic, although the disease is in my family.  I am, however, a pre-diabetic and have to watch my weight carefully.
5;These bars ROCK!;I love most of the Larabar products because they only have a few basic ingredients in them and they are all natural without fillers.  They don't add sugar or sugar substitutes which I love.
5;Best Barbecue Chicken Glaze . The General Does It Right;I'm not the biggest chicken fan, but a friend of mine, Chef Mike,<br />of West Creek, NJ ..
4;Larry's Beans are good.;I'm enjoying the coffees from Larry's Beans Fair Trade, Fair Trade and Organic notwithstanding, as these too are important to me.  Delivery is quick, I love the free shipping.
5;Love Budyy Biscuts;I have a lab and he loves these biscuits.  They are the perfect size for training, even the big dogs.
5;Great tea...;This is the best red rooibos tea I have found!! Recommend it to all my friends..
4;over all good too much basil;I was trying to find the old Garlic and Cheese by whirley pop. And this company came up .
5;yummy!;This product makes home-baking so easy!  After baking, I slice, put about 3 slices in a baggie, several baggies in a larger one, and freeze. Convenient to take out the slice or two that I need.
5;WOW;Never thought I would get so excited over a boxed cake mix.  But after spending way too much money on Gluten-free products that taste awful with a sawdust texture.
5;Awesome Product;This product has done amazing wonders for my wife's GI system.  I would highly recommend it far and above over the counter products, which we have tried, without success for years.
5;Sun Maid raisons;I feel like I have tried all the brands out there and find that these are still the best.  They have a naturally sweet flavor, they are moists, and smell very fresh.
5;The Best, Most Authentic Coconut Water - Amazing seller!;I just got back from Thailand, and  I think I drank at least one coconut per day.  Upon my return I wanted to find something that compared to the original (it's hard to keep coconuts in the fridge!)  I thought Zico was ok, but it tasted watered down and nothing like the Thai Coconuts I was used to.
2;Not enough coffee;The coffee was good, but there wasn't enough of it.  Ten of the 22 cups were tea or decaf.
5;Not Jerked around by prices;Great Product. I am a huge Jack Links jerky fan but its a bit pricy no matter where you buy it.
5;OMG;"Oh my goodness, I can see now what the fuss is about when it comes to aged balsamic vinegar.  It's like the difference between the house champagne at a Sunday Brunch (you know, the stuff the restaurant serves with a towel wrapped around the bottle so you can't see that it's labeled ""carbonated kool-aid"" or whatever) and a good bottle of aged Cristal."
5;Good Coffee!;I have used this coffee in the past, so I knew in advance that it was a good product. In fact, it was originally given to me as a gift by a friend from Turkey.
5;The right cleanser for me.;Love this facial cleanser.  My skin tends to be oily and flaky.
5;Roland Fancy Albacore White Tuna;"I have bought this product ""Roland Fancy Albacore White Tuna Sp, 6.125-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)"" several times now and I love it."
5;The Coffee Lovers say it is great!;Good buy and the coffee is good.  50 cups of coffee that are quick, available, and cheaper than the high price places.
5;Popcorn lover's dream!;This is the perfect product to get that movie-theater popcorn at home. Everything is in the package all you have to do is open it and put it in the popcorn popper and it makes really great popcorn.
5;Sunkist gems;Product came very quickly, carefully packaged and tasted terrific!  I particularly am pleased when a vendor packs an item with plenty of cushion and the product, therefore, is not damaged.  I will order from them again.
5;Yummalicious!;This recipe is rich, creamy with just the right blend of spices without being too hot.  It's makes preparing a restauarant quality dish quick and easy.
3;too crunchy;Bought for my husband who wanted a cereal not as crunchy as granola, but this food was not much less granola.  It is a good tasting cereal.
5;O.N.E.  coconut water;We love coconut water..
5;Delicious Tasting Prunes....;These prunes are delicious to eat! Since we started eating Newmans Organic Prunes the store bought ones do not compare. We notice a difference and feel healthier for eating these.
5;Koops Mustard Dusseldorf Squeeze, 12-Ounce (Pack of 6);The wife and I like Mustard as opposed to ketchup. We experiment with many brands of mustard.
5;Crunchy and Tasty;These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste. Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning.
1;Very disappointed...;I am very disappointed in this formula. It doesn't mix well at all.
5;Very pleased;I bought these fruit pastilles as a surprise gift for a friend in Canada who loves them but can't get them where she lives.  The price, including delivery charge, was much less than if I'd bought a box here in England and mailed it to her.
5;Extremely effective;I've just installed the third unit in our garage or outdoors on a tree branch.  In each case, after a few hours, the trap is surrounded by a swarm of flies practically going frantic to get inside.
5;I Like These A Lot;For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.
2;Low Carb Bagels;I really wanted to like these and on first inspection they seemed like a wonderful, fluffy wheat bagel.  I toasted and slathered on a cream cheese / salmon spread.
5;I'm Ruined...;Plain tea or even regular green tea does not do it for me anymore thanks to this DELICIOUS tea! No sweetener required..
5;Daaalish!;My local health food store charges over $16.00 for a 2.
5;GREAT TASTE;MY DAUAGHTER TOLD ME ABOUT THESE BROWNIES.  THEY TASTE GREAT AND FILL MY URGE FOR CHOCOLATE.
1;The recipe or ingredient quality has changed (?);I am on the board of an animal shelter, and have 23 cats of my own.  We were directed to Wellness as an excellent no-grain food.
3;Davidson's Rooibos tea, not infuser friendly.;I have been using loose teas for many years.  However, Davidson's Organic South Sfrican Rooibos tea was cut so thin that a lot of the tea and sediment goes right through most tea infusers.
3;Un-mayonnaise-y texture;I agree with the reviewer that said it has a funny texture.  Like tapioca (flour) without the little pearls.
4;Lecreuset;This was a good value and exactly what I expected.  I was a little surprised how sweet it was until I read an article about this phenomenon specifically about maple sugar.
5;Yummy!!  Loved these!;Purchased these for my candy buffet at my wedding.  Big hit by everyone.
4;Nice tasting drink;I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.
4;Peanut Butter Goodness;Not bad. Crunchy.
5;Great product!;This is a great product when in a hurry!  I'm surprised at the price though.  My store sells it for $3.
5;Leaves hair so well cared for you will feel way younger than your years;My husband and I both tried this product. We have different types of hair.
4;Jamaica Blue Mountain, the very best.;If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system.
3;Yumberry .... miss Wild Blackcurrant;It seems that this Yumberry Blackcurrat tea may have replaced the Wild Blackcurrent tea.  The Yumberry Blackcurrant is good, bur not as flavorful or have the bold fruity taste of the Wild Blackcurrant.
5;illy fan is loving this blend in our home machine;"As my wife and I found we had become ""those people"" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter."
5;Bulletproof!;So after having returned not one, but two, of the Cuisinart Keurig brewers due to broken water pumps, I've settled on this commercial grade Keurig OfficePro B145 brewer for home use. I bought the unit from my local Staples for one hundred thirty-nine dollars, tax included.
5;Smells better than others?;What can I say..
5;Wonderful Oil;This hazelnut oil is wonderful and a great value as well. Buy it, you will love it.
4;Wolfgang Puck Coffee - Sumatra Kopi Raya for Keurig;"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon."
4;very yummy and excellent protein;The bar is very tasty and has the protein I was looking for. A great product.
3;Watch out for expiration date and packaging;Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months.
5;Dog likes it and ingredients look fine to me.;I have been feeding this salmon recipe to my King Charles since I was concerned of his health. He has been eating this for more than 3 months now and he is doing great.
1;Very Disappointing;As another reviewer said, these salted caramels are full of unpleasant ingredients such as coconut oil, making them unhealthy. If you're going for healthy, caramel isn't your best bet anyway,  but traditional ingredients would be better.
4;This chicken broth is pretty good;This chicken broth is pretty good. It has less sodium and is organic, which are definitely pluses! I use this much in my cooking.
4;A unique flavor for fans of Thai food;"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."
5;Best Olive Oil I've bought!;I was listening to public radio one day awhile back ago, and the topic was on olive oil. I learned alot from this program and it really wasn't something that gave me much thought, until then.
5;Great product!;Golazo is the best energy drink out there, especially the Mandarina flavor. Gives me energy but doesn't have a lot of sugar and doesn't contain any artificial ingredients.
2;Hard to Drink When Brewed Strong;Most tea can be brewed stronger or weaker, as desired.  But if you let the tea steep, or put too much in, the spices completely overwhelm the tea and it becomes undrinkable.
5;Reese's Rule;My in-laws sent me this Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Party Bag for Christmas. My in-laws rock! This is what all in-laws should do.
5;Awesome! Not just about the chipotle.;The additional spices, especially the hickory really add something special to this sauce. As with the Jalape&ntilde
1;Terrible;Reading all the positive feedbacks about this product i decided to try and i was very disappointed by the taste of this coffee..
3;Just Okay;This product mixes nicely and achieves the texture of peanut butter very nicely.While it does taste like peanuts it lacks the SWEETNESS of pb.
5;O.N.E. Coconut Water;First time I tried this product, I purchased it from a convenience store on a hot spring day. Very refreshing and I was instantly energized without the jitters like from energy drinks.
1;New York Style made in Bulgaria;not good, dry and tasteless. Considering that it was  imported from Bulgaria, I wonder how fresh it could be.
5;Shell succes;Like most, I purchased these escargot shells for a fish tank setup (30 gallon). None of the shells were broken when the packages were open and they look natural in the tank.
5;My dogs loved this;One of my dogs tore his ACL and had to have TPLO surgery which has a 12-week recovery period. I knew I needed something to keep him occupied so I ordered a bunch of Made in America treats off of Amazon.
4;A Great Place to Start;"I very seldom prepare a soup from dry mix without additions, and this is no exception.  I diced a large onion, and about 6"" length of cajun sausage,  and sauteed them lightly before adding the water."
1;Very Stale;I bought the new container of French's French Fried Onion Rings and they were STALE from the moment I opened them.  NEVER had a problem with the old container.
5;nearly the most amazing noodle bowl i've had...;as i've written in a previous review, this is not your standard ramen noodle. it's a rice noodle, so it's clearish/translucent.
5;Best sauce (except my own of course!);My husband made me get this when we first moved in together 3 years ago while being stationed in Charleston, SC. He's originally from Florida so he was, needless to say, obsessed with Sonny's.
4;Pretty good and not horribly salty;I got this because the generic popcorn I was buying was so salty it was disgusting and I wanted to try something name brand that might not be so bad.  I refuse to pay $3.
4;Suprisingly light and tasty;I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version.
4;change in recipe?;this is my review. (i have commented said review on other reviewers because it seems fitting.
5;This stuff should be illegal!;Forget heroin..
1;do not feed this product to pugs.;My pug almost died from this product. A piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract.
5;Sooo Good;I really love these bars.  I prefer them more than name brand candy bars and they are good for you!  They came quickly and I had no problems with signs of melting in transit as I had with other nutrition bars.
5;Salt and Vinegar Almonds- Amazon;The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again.
4;Great for Peanut Butter lovers trying to watch fat intake;Fine powder, great when added to Whey smoothie. Gonna try in cookies at Christmas.
5;Response to the 2-star review...;To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods..
5;Really great tasting tea.;I purchased this tea for a neighbor when she had mentioned that she loved the taste. I then went and purchased a pack of 120 (a bit much, I know) but it was totally worth it.
5;Health promoting product, organic per label, good price per ounce;I like this flaxfeed product for a few reasons. I use it for omega-3 and fiber.
5;Silky San Francisco Scent;I've been a long-time loyalist to Cafe Altura's Dark French Roast, but wanted to try something new.  The San Francisco Blend is just as bold as the dark French, but has a brighter smell that reminds me of San Francisco in the Spring.
5;Very well presented.;The girls like the Hello Kitty brand and it offered more than just candy. The color was appealing and the box made it unique.
2;Clove tea;I was very disappointed with this tea.  I love chai, and was excited to find a decaf version.
5;Stash Premium Gunpowder Green Tea, Loose Leaf;This is a high quality green tea from Stash that makes some excellent tea.<br /><br />The first time I made the tea, I steeped it for a little too long, so there was some bitterness.
5;Incredible!;These were given to me as a gift this year. I have a well-developed sweet tooth, and these truffles are so rich and smooth that I could only eat one or two at a time.
4;Tastes just like grape soda to me;If I was a fan of grape soda then I would certainly purchase Zevia grape. It has a nice grape flavor that isn't overly sweet.
5;Lots to roar about this cheese...............;"There MAY be other blue cheeses out there as good as this one but you will definately not find one better!  Creamy texture and firm with just the right balance of mild nutty flavors.  There are what we call ""flavor crystals"" that add a slight bit of crunch every so often."
5;Extremely tasty but very hard to find.;We picked up 3 bottles of this about a month ago at a Winco grocery store in Northern California for $2.00 per bottle.
5;This is an exceptional beef bouillon maker that is healthy for you to use!;We use this bouillon to add to our meals for multiple reasons. You can add this beef flavored bouillon and it adds flavor to your meal without adding fat and provides an ideal bouillon to use to make gravy with or to use as a basting sauce to roast or broil your meat in.
5;great teriyaki sauce;Found this was the best sauce to have with salmon. Try marinating the salmon with a little of the sauce beforehand and it gets even better.
5;Dogs love it;Pricey, but my dogs love it and it's a great training aid. I cut them into smaller pieces and use them for blackmail, or training, depending on how you look at it.
5;The best dog food!;After finding out my toy Shih Tzu was allergic to practically every dog food, I tried this. Not only is he not allergic to it, he loves it! He finishes every last morsel.
3;Jazzed Down;As a fan of the regular Big Easy Bold coffee cups, I did not hesitate to order the decaf, expecting the same depth and richness.  I was disappointed however when I brewed the first cup to find that it tasted much like Dunkin Donuts.
4;Amazing smell, good flavor;It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.
5;Fantastic Protein Shake;I have to rely on protein shakes to meet my protein quota of 80 grams a day.  I tell you this product makes it very easy to meet my goals.
5;goji berries;"we are taking navitas at their word that these goji berries are organic obviously.  how could they be anything but ""natural"" :-) ?  great buy, tasty and good for the body."
2;Good idea, but WAY TOO SMALL!;Needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. When the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that I could dump back into the litter box.
1;The foil inside is not tighly sealed;The two bottles were packed tightly. When I opened the tight packing and open the bottles, the foils inside were not tightly sealed.
5;lamb and rice review;I was very happy with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the treats.  My dogs love them.
5;Outstanding !!!;This is the BEST popcorn I have ever had. Wonderful taste, fun to make in the Whirley stove top Popcorn popper, you will never go back to microwave popcorn again.
4;Blackberry = Sorta Blackberry;This review is for the blackberry flavor of this product only. I can't speak for the other flavors.
3;It's okay but I won't buy it again.;I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.
5;Good for You and Tastes OK;I added Amazing Grass Green to my smoothie recipe and it made it taste better! I think it has a grassy flavor with a hint of sweetness--but only 1 gram of sugar. I add it to my almond milk, psyllium, flax, chia seed, banana and blueberry smoothie and think it made it better.
5;Tastes like dessert;For licorice lovers only.  Intense licorice flavor and is naturally sweet, so needs no sugar or honey.
5;Essential equipment for our puppy;We've tried several toys to slow down our Olympic-class speed eater.  This is by far the best -- it's easy to use, built like a tank, and most importantly, he loves it.
4;caribou blend coffee;What can I say, the deer and the antelop did not do anything to this coffee.  Neither did the caribou.
4;Nice..;Exactly what I am looking for. Really nice taste, not too strong but with a real taste of coffee nothing to do with the medium roast.
5;oil;This seems like a good product. We buy a lot of organic food and the price was reasonable for the olive oil.
5;A Passion for Vanilla;"Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar ""Bourbon Islands,"" Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract."
5;Second Favorite K-Cup Coffee;Although the daybreak is the best, this is a good second for when you want a good, flavorful, sipping cup of coffee..
5;Love these things;Great candy.  Fast ship, great seller If you like jelly beans, these are a must.
5;"Clean plate tells me, ""Goooooooood.  Thanks!""&lt";
5;best gravy ever!;I FIRST FOUND THIS PRODUCT AT A BREAD OUTLET STORE. BUT IT CLOSED .
5;AMAZING!!;I love this product!  All the flavor and protein and no oil and less cholesterol.  What's not to love?  It mixes well in shakes and (obviously) tastes just like real peanut butter!<br /><br />I'll be buying this ASAP.
3;They're OK;Delivery was fine, no broken crackers, no stale product. Well packed, lots of air packages.
5;great bars;I like these bars because they are high quality and I get them at a good price on amazon. They taste good.
5;Ladies love this one;I don't drink it but have to buy 50 pack because all the woman just love it.  So it's a very fast mover.
5;This is a great training aid;My dog loves this and she has learned amny tricks fast.  The best part is that it doesn't put weight on her.
5;Delicous!!;These just maybe one of my favorite Kind bars. I enjoy grabbing one as that chocolate craving comes in the afternoon.
1;Smells pretty good, tastes...not so good.;"I figured that blueberry would be a nice change from the ""normal"" flavored coffees.."
5;Great Product + Excellent Price!;As a Bed & Breakfast owner and a serious online bargain-shopper, I happened upon this product while searching for the best price on K-Cups.  Needless to say, I serve a LOT of coffee!  Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.
5;A great coffee!!;This is an amazing coffee.  Intense flavor, but not bitter.
2;I liked it at first...;The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it.
5;YUMMY!;I love these things.  I like the whole line of popped and baked cheese.
4;GREAT TASTE;This was their first product.  It is filtered, hence the clear color, and while doesnt have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product, for taste, it can't be beat.
5;Pero coffee substitute;Love Pero coffee substitute. I am on my 2nd jar and will continue to order.
4;Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?;These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too.
2;Lame;"I understand that the description says ""Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice"" so I can't be too mad, but its a bit ridiculous when you buy a 22-pack tea ""sampler"" and you only get 7 differnt types of tea. I received 5 Green Tea, 5 Sleepytime Herbal Tea, 4 English Breakfast Black Tea."
5;Penguin cornbread;My husband bought this cornbread at COSCO and we just loved it.  COSCO has stopped selling it in our area and I have been searching everywhere for it.
5;Love this coffee;I love this coffee, but I am having trouble finding in the stores lately.  This smells fantastic while brewing and is not overpowering to the taste.
4;These chips are awesome if not best but....;I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010.
5;Wonderful;I had some honey glazed pecans in a salad in a resturant and wanted to try to duplicate, so I ordered these, well they have not made it into the salad yet. My whole family has been eating them just a a great snack.
5;HUSBAND LOVES IT.;FOR MYSELF, THIS WAS TOO HOT. BUT MY HUSBAND JUST LOVES IT.
3;Hard, dry but organic and flavorful;These prunes are flavorful but are not soft and moist like the best selling grocery store brands.  Because they are organic, because the profits go to charity and because it is so easy to buy from Amazon I do rebuy them and either stew them or soak them overnight in the Fridge.
5;Great find, good as is, very good with just a little work;My wife and I have been very pleased with this purchase. This is a great tasting, truly easy meal.
1;Inexpensive coffee lacking in flavor;I am a true coffee lover  and it is my favorite beverage morning or night.  I enjoy brewing coffee at home and buy a variety of brands in varying price points.
3;Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity.;Like that it's Organic but can find same item with that quality with larger quantity.  My son likes the taste.
5;Sole reason I purchased a $200.00+ coffee maker;I have a friend and antique shop owner who I normally visit weekly and like others I stop by even if I know I am not going to purchase a thing solely for this coffee. With the holidays coming around I became so busy I was unable to get my fix so I broke down and bought a machine for my home that was approximately $230.
1;WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.;My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.
5;All i can say is wow!!!!;Just when you open the jar for the very first time is amazing!  Honey has a tremendous amount of benefits!  I eat a table spoon before going to work and the gym.  It really gives you an energy boost, which is a lot better then those energy drinks!!!  It also helped me to get rid of a cold that I was starting to catch.
1;Disappointed, no cinnamon and no vanilla;I ordered this excited about the unusual combination. I have been looking for a good natural cinnamon tea since Good Earth Sweet and Spicy went to artificial flavors.
5;best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them;Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.
1;spicy not sweet;Bought this mustard because I hoped it would taste like Johnsonville Mustard Sweet N' Hot which I can't find anywhere.  This mustard is not at all sweet, and the hot part of it tastes like pure horseradish.
5;I love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend Coffee;I love the smoothness and taste of Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain..
3;Decent enough coffee drink in a can;"This product claims to have ""50% more caffeine"" than whatever else you can find in a canned coffee drink. Maybe this is true, but I have to say that based on the several cans I've consumed, a strong buzz failed to materialize."
5;Both of my cats love it;My cats love Mack and Jack.  I save around $8 ordering it by the case.
3;Good concept, but where is the filling?;Stila is a toasted crunchy cookie type bar with rolled oaks sprinkled on the top. I really like it because of the crunch factor, and also because it is not overly sweet.
4;Espresso Powder;Love the product! I make a mean Tiramisu cheesecake. I have used regular instant coffee in the recipe but it calls for espresso powder.
5;Hot Chocolate;First time use of Nutella..
5;Helping to lose weight;Enjoying this product. I use it to make the Dukan diet gallete and have lost 20 pounds in a month.
5;Israeli Couscous;This product is excellent. My husband and I recently stopped in a restaurant in Fredericksburg, VA and I was served this type couscous with a salmon dish.
1;literally flavorless;This might be the worst coffee I've ever had. I am somewhat of a coffee connoisseur.
4;"A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either ""Blazin'"" or ""Buffalo Wing.""";I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting.
5;Great for my finicky eaters;My 2 and 4 yr old drink these in the car.  It's a great snack for toddlers on the go with all the vitamins and minerals of fruit and veggies.
4;Nice;I like my Keurig.  The only thing I have to say is that in my haste to purchase this product, I may not have investigated my purchase very thoroughly which is what I will do from here on out.
3;Too Much and Too Sweet;I would not recommend buying this product because of its large quantities and extremely sweet flavor. Caution: They may not be as healthy as they seem.
5;MOVIE THEATER POPCORN @ HOME !;BETTER than Movie Theater Popcorn at a bargain price. 3 Separate compartments in one pouch - one for seeds, one for salt, one for oil.
3;Good enough;About the same quality  stores in my area carry but slightly less expensive. They are mushy.
5;Found at long last!;I have been unable to find Chocolate Malt-O-Meal for about 10 years now. I don't know why the grocery stores here in the Northwest quit carrying it.
4;Delicious & Nutritious, Mmmmmmm;I enjoy sprinkling Ezekiel 4:9 Organic Sprouted Grain Cereal on my Spoon Size Shredded Wheat and enjoying it with some fresh fruit and Activia yogurt. We have tried two of their four flavors.
5;Best wet food!;Nice to know my 15 year old cat is eating healthy organic food (and has done for years) AND he is crazy about the taste. He is very picky and wont even touch the other flavours.
5;Delicious!;These cookies are awesome.  Great for dieters and those cutting out sugar.
3;Unlisted ingredient of Baxter Lobster Bisque;This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food.
5;Strogalicious!;Hi Everyone,<br />  We love the Annie's Beef Stroganoff organic skillet meal.  This is very quick and easy.
5;absolutely the best canned tomatoes AND organic;This is a ditto of my other Muir Glen tomato reviews, but I feel the same way about all of them, so here goes..
5;Product 19;This is hands down the best cereal I have ever had. The taste is so unique from the other cornflake type cereals I've tried.
5;Love these!;My kids and I love these granola bars although I will admit that because we are gluten-free, the bar is set pretty low.  That being said, these bars are soft and chewy without being too sticky, there are plenty of mini-dark chocolate chips to appeal to the under-5's, and the almonds, quinoa, chia and flax (protein! omega 3 & 6s!) make me super happy.
4;Tasty & sweet, so good!;I've always liked Kellogg's cereals, so Crunchy Nut was an easy choice for my breakfast needs.<br /><br />First impressions:<br /><br />I could smell the peanuts as I opened the box, so I knew I'd be in for some tasty goodness! I tried a couple of the flakes before the milk was added and it had the same texture and taste as Frosted Flakes.
5;Hazelnut Heaven;My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.
5;Delicious!;These were the best brownies that I've ever eaten. Very moist and the multiple flavors will delight your taste buds.
5;Absolutely delicious coffee!;I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.
2;Dogs don't like it;My dogs have not been too hard to please with food.  They will eat almost anything, but they have little interest in the 3 cases of this stuff I bought.
5;Good stuff just as expected.;The ice cream arrived fresh and delicous.  The kids (and adults) loved it.
5;Tasty and I Can Get Them Conveniently;I've been eating Chex Multi Bran cereal for several years.  They are tasty and a relatively wholesome cereal.
5;Wow!;I have always loved the Garden of Eatin' Chili-Lime chips, but these are a close second.  I also ordered the Nacho (which my kids like, but I can't eat).
2;Dry skin;Though it says that this is a deep moisturizer, I am very prone to dry skin especially in the winter if I don't use the right soap. I thought I would give this a try since Dove is known for being a very good body wash.
1;Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!;Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.
1;Aftertaste, multiple ingredients;I wish I had realized that there are other ingredients in this aside from the monk fruit. I am a diabetic, so I have to be more careful than others.
4;Good strong cup of coffee;One of my favorite bold flavors. Many of the K-cups are too weak for us, including the flavored varieties.
5;Great seasoning!;I use a packet or two of this in my Spanish/tex mex rice. It gives the rice a bright orange color and fabulous taste.
5;Like Juicy Fruit Gum! Yum yum!;Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games.
3;If Captain Crunch had an affair with Life cereal....;"I like to eat Kashi Crunch and I was hoping this would be a slightly tastier alternative.  But when they says a ""hint of brown sugar"" they mean it!  These squares were not very exciting when it comes to flavor and I could barely register the brown sugar."
4;not bad;I like the Keurig but finding the right coffee can be difficult as there are so many out there. I got the variety pack and this was one of the better.
5;Lipton To Go Stix Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix;Love this product!  Being a tea lover, I found this to be an easy and quick way to enjoy iced tea.  Am looking forward to trying the other varities in this line of tea mixes.
5;Bear creek soup;This soup is really good! My whole family loves it. The creamy wild rice is our favorite, creamy potato is also good.
4;Too much Fiber than protein;My goal is to gain weight in a healthy way so i need good quality veg protein with a little fiber to promote regular bowels. This product has too much fiber which i feel is not demulcent.
1;Splenda / Sucralose in all flavours...;I'm not a fan of diet soda, and even the Non-Diet flavours have splenda in them.  This does let them have a more concentrated product and therefore a smaller bottle, but I don't like the taste.
2;Too sweet.. most people will like that;Its too sweet. A lot of people will like it, but it is closer to a soda then it is to drinking straight out of a coconut.
5;Tasty Brownies;I picked these up because my wife is trying (sort of) to eat gluten-free.  She loves these brownies, and I have to admit that they are pretty good.
1;Absolutely foul;They aren't sour. They look and taste like a slightly used Lemon Head.
5;Good stuff;Free flowing flake salt, big size means that I had to transfer to plastic bottle to keep dry because box not good for long term storage after opening.  Reccomend using a dry clear plastic juice bottle minimum 2 liter size.
4;yummmm;I bought this to use in my morning cappuccino..
4;Healthy, Versatile, and Filling;Kind's Cinnamon Oat Clusters are some of the most versatile foods imaginable. They can be used as cereal by adding milk.
5;Keeps my dog happy and busy;My cocker spaniel loves these. They are cheaper on here through subscribe and save than anywhere else, even with coupons in stores.
5;Dont let the name fool you...;This is regular Paprika you buy in the grocery store. Its good and a great price.
5;Mighty good tea!;If you're hesitant about trying green tea just because it's good for you, then this is the one to begin with.  Subtle tropical fruit flavors combined with a mild tea equal a delicious cup of tea for any time of day.
5;Great Product & Service;Excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. Was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.
5;Holistic Select is quality;I have purchased the small sized bag of Holistic Select for many years.  My cockapoo really likes this food but his Mom likes the quality ingredients in it.
4;Good Coffee easy;Pod type coffee takes the guess work out of making the morning cup o'joe. D&E Coffee is smooth with a great frothy head.
4;Shipment packing needs to be improved;My husband loves these cookies. We receive a shipment monthly and each shipment has been packed differently.
4;Baby Loved It!;My daughter loved this because it was chunkier than the Earth's Best stage 3 foods.  The only thing is that while Earth's Best is cheaper through Amazon Mom, this is actually cheaper through Fresh Direct, so we get our through them.
5;Very good natural dog food;This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.
4;Good buy .. Lotts of sugar;I bought these with the intentions to use these as a potty reward!!!, NO WAY !!! IF YOU HAVE THE SAME IDEA STOP !!!! These are good for older and adults!, I LOVE them..
5;Charms pops;These are some all time favorites we love these. They are not sold in many stores n box qty so this was a good deal.
5;A little too 'cosmic'..;My half Siamese half Himalayan cat goes crazy with this stuff! I put some on her back, and on the floor around her and she laid and rolled in this stuff for like 10 hours! Although she is an older cat, she really does love this catnip. It helps their digestive system as well!<br /><br />Very good buy.
4;Taste vs Fullness;The Fudge Drizzle Caramel popcorn is really yummy -- the caramel is sweet but not cloying and the popcorn is satisfyingly crunchy.  However, like so many SnackWell products, this is NOT a low calorie snack considering the calories to fullness ratio -- my daughter put away three bags in fifteen minutes as her after school snack after a long hard day at school.
5;Fabulous;We purchased this bread locally through one of our regional health food stores as well as a large national chain. Their prices were forever increasing, and we decided to buy in bulk from Amazon.
5;more uses than you thought!;Our water comes from a well and is super high in mineral content.  So the minerals build up on everything it touches.
5;Very much enjoying the fresh nutmeg;The product was received in a timely fashion.  I am enjoying the whole nutmeg a great deal.
4;Certainly crunchy;"There potato chips are certainly crunchy - but (to me) they have a rather stange 'checmically' aftertaste.  Not as delicious as  ""Kettle"" brand potato chips, but certainly a more consistent color and less oily on the fingers."
1;Disappointing;For the price this product has NO truffle characteristics at all.  I could have been eating black pencil shavings with more flavor.
5;can't stop eating it!;This is the tastiest, smoothest sauce I have ever encountered. I wish I bought more.
3;Misleading!;This product is claimed to be biodegradeable, but it is not.  When the bags arrived, they were clearly different from the originals that we received as a gift, so my wife called the company and learned they had changed the chemistry of the plastic, and they are no longer biodegradeable.
2;I was disappointed.;The dark chocolate truffle flavor overpowers the coffee flavor.  Not the best combination of chocolate and coffee.
5;Just as good as I remembered!;This product has been so hard to find in the grocery stores! I was so excited to see it was available for purchase on Amazon! When I was a child, my mother would make this spaghetti for me and I absolutely loved it. It is my all-time favorite spaghetti, even now.
4;Reasonably good instant coffee;As stated, reasonably good for instant coffee. I think most everyone would prefer a cup of fresh-brewed, but that's not always feasible.
3;Caribou Blend Decaf;So-So coffee.  Okay if you are not into rich, robust coffee.
4;Pretty Good;These are a soft, sweet cookie with a good flavor.  They are great for lunch packs and a quick snack.
5;Mushroom Popcorn;I am a popcorn lover and this popcorn was amazing.  It pops up great, really tasty, and quite a conversation piece.
5;Great Tasting Coffee;I bought this for my hubby, he loves dark rich coffee & Dark Magic offers it. Great convenience of the Kcup makes it that much nicer.
4;Delicious;So hard to find coconut water with pulp.  So much better with pulp.
5;Fabulous taste!;This is my most favorite fall flavor K-cup.  The aroma scents my entire kitchen.
5;Good Halloween candy;You need to be careful of the source as the quality depends a lot on the shipper.  I usually order these by the mini-case.
5;SO much easier to pill my cat with these!!;I bought this brand from Amazon (salmon flavor) and they are absolutely wonderful for me and for my kitty who gets daily pills.  I pinch off a bit of a pill pocket and mould it around the pill (use just enough to coat the pill completely), pop it in the back of her throat and it's gone.
5;They are a hit!;My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.
5;My dogs are loving these, thinly sliced so easy to chew;I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc.
5;Excellent;"This was my first jug and I will re-order. It is a bit thinner than other brands I've tried, but more ""maply"" in taste."
5;Excellent product!;I've taken magnesium for years, quality brands, and know it is helpful for my health problems.  I just tried this brand this time and was amazed at how quickly after drinking it I felt very calm and relaxed.
5;strong enough for 2 cups;This stuff is strong and dark, it's prefect for double pump to fill that 18-20oz to-go cup. After cream and sweetener, it tastes just like a cup of Timothy's Colombian Dorado (Which I love), except you get X2 the amount.
5;Tasty!;I purchased this for one brother on the recommendation of my oldest brother and I could not locate the brand anywhere in my local area.  So, just hoping by chance Amazon would have this item, I scroll through and bingo.
4;Interesting flavor combo/ Tasty yet Pricey;OK - I love this mix, except the honey mustard pretzels. While I love HM pretzels on their own, just not in this mix, flavors don't go together that well,  in my opinion.
5;Best Cat food EVER!!!;This stuff is great. The cats love it ( all flavors actually), and since eating it their coats are softer, shinier, with less dandruff.
5;AWESOME!!;this stuff is delicious..
3;Mint?;This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but .
5;Fabulous!;These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals.
4;Wonderful brand;My dogs and cats love Weruva canned food.  My two dogs don't like the Kurobuta Hero as well as the other flavors they have tried but they do eat it.
5;Even better than I expected;I just tried these recently and I can't get enough of them now.  They don't have the texture of buffalo chicken wings, it's more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizza.
5;Yummy;Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but..
5;Love, Love, Love my Mueslix!!;Don't know why I can't find these in my supermarket but I can't.  You get pack of 5 when you order.
5;Tasty, Tasty Thai Coffee;The one thing that I missed from my time in Thailand was the Nescafe MyCup.  It's just unappologetically sugary sweetened coffee in a stick.
2;bring back the butter!!!;"Barbara's animal cookies used to taste good.  I think they have tried to make them more ""healthy"" which has resulted in a tasteless, boring cookie."
3;damn spoon;this stuff is good in coffee, but good luck getting the spoon back in the tin. Chip Davis, we are disappointed.
4;Cats really are fussy;Cats are tough.  Evan when I thought I'd found a flavor they like, fancy feast florentine collection ,they ended up getting tired of it and leaving alot on the plate.
5;Spicy and delicious;I love jerky.<br />When it comes to fresh organic jerky nothing beats Ed's Roadhouse.
5;Top Notch -- too bad I cant find it that often;These shortbread cookies are AWESOME. I prefer the orange-chocolate chip, as they go well with chai earl grey, but they're all good.
4;Great to have a chance to sample;I love Think Thin bars, but had only tried the chocolate peanut butter.  This seemed like the perfect way to sample a couple other types and still know that I had my favorites on hand.
2;Not Great.;I usually drink French Roast, either Peet's or the Costco variety. This coffee had a distinctive burnt taste, much more pronounced than Peet's.
5;Best Cat Food;"I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his ""spunk"" so I decided it was time to start buying him ""real"" cat food.."
5;Amazon - Fat-Free Gummi Bears;Tastes very good. If you feel an urge to snack, this is the perfect sweet delight.
4;"Awesome ""Hot Wing"" supplement";Ive always been a big Jack Links jerky fan.  I usually buy a couple bags a month, but last month I was in Vegas and they were out of A1 flavor.
3;This Coffee is Not Bad;"This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of ""pods"" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices."
4;Good everyday coffee;I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.
4;Vanilla? or Hazelnut? Good coffee, either way.;"I admit, I'm not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (yes, there are those of out there who aren't), but I do enjoy flavored coffees, so looked forward to trying this Natural Fusions Vanilla-Flavored Ground Coffee from Starbucks. I thoroughly enjoyed the coffee, but I do question whether it is actually ""vanilla"" flavored or hazelnut."
5;Are you kidding me!? SO GOOD!;The words 'protein drink' don't generally conjure up images of something that is both delicious and good for you, but this product is great! It doesn't have the smell of other powders, you know the smell..
5;Good stuff!;Nice, smooth cup of Joe. High recommend.
5;"Great ""Half and Half"" Tea with a Kick";I never liked energy drinks before tasting Monster Rehab.  When I finally got around to trying Rehab at the suggestion of friends, I was pleasantly surprised.
5;a golden choice;I send this coffee to my adopted soldier too with Belgian thins (I try to be coherent) and he told me it was really very good.  He will buy it back to the US.
2;Not strong enough;"I like my coffee to be VERY strong, and this just didn't quite do it for me. It tastes good, but the ""espresso"" is misleading is you like coffee that actually resembles espresso in strength."
5;The name says it all.;I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program.
3;I have a solution to the black mold problem in the Beaba!;Like most of you, I noticed the black mold problem and was horrified. I tried the vinegar solution to no avail.
4;Just plain good!;"I love the cereal on which these bars are based, so I wasn't surprised that these are also great.  The only reason it doesn't get a ""5"" is so I don't water-down that rating by making everything I like a ""5."
4;Pretty good product.;For the most part I am pleased with this product. The flavor and texture is good.
1;Do NOT purchase this juicer;Absolutely disappointed with this product. I was so excited to see it finally at my door.
5;Gum!;Bought this for party. Just put out a big bowl with gum balls in it.
5;A safe and tasty cereal for Celiacs;This cereal is not for you if you're used to sugary junk cereal. If you have Celiac's disease and multiple allergies, however, like me, or if you just want a pure and wholesome cereal without a lot of unhealthy additives, this is definitely for you.
5;OH YEAH!!!!;This was a Christmas gift for a special friend. He absolutely LOVED that I was able to give him an original taste of his home state.
5;Best and easiest Jerk Rub around!;My first time using this Jerk rub..
5;Bali's is indeed the best!;This candy is great and it lasts a long time. The flavor is just like coffee.
5;Yummy AND gluten free!;Very soft and yummy cookies. I bought these for my gluten-intolerant daughter and wound up liking them myself!  They have other flavors that are also very good.
5;Awesome coffee & value!;WE were looking for a  bold coffee that didn't taste bitter..
4;"A ""Must Have"" for our dogs";Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards.
5;Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken 5.5 Oz. Can (24 Pack);We purchased the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken after adding a new kitten to our family. After shelter and vet food recommendations, we had upgraded to the shelter's all-natural healthy brand but the cats much preferred the junk from the grocery store and the senior cat rejected the natural food.
5;Easy!!! if you have a gas oven;If your gas oven is warm inside, you can make yogurt extremely easy.<br /><br />1.
1;Couldn't even finish one cup;I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.
5;Delicious;I am not really much on reviewing candy but these are far by the best gummi bears I have ever eaten.  They are soft and not overly chewy to where you need to work like a cows mouth to chew them.
2;Yuck;I was shocked at how small the boxes of jelly beans were.  The only positive to this product was the excitement on my son's face when he opened it.
1;SUPER SOUR!!!;My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor.
5;Delicious pasta;I like all the Dreamfields pasta, but the linguine are my favorite. I eat low-carb but I love pasta, and good low-carb pasta is hard to find.
3;Add bbq sauce to eat these, then some flavor and less oily taste;My first sardines from here, and I thought they were very good after my disgusting experience with an eastern seaboard brand, all mushy.  Then I tried the Crown Prince ones here, and these Season ones fell in rank, as mushy and flavorless and oily.
4;Pacific Organic Soymilk;Love that this product has only 2 ingredients: filtered water and whole organic soybeans. This is exactly what we wanted
5;Awesome product!;I have been making jams and jellies for many years.  I have always used Low Sugar Recipe Surejel (pink box).
5;No bitterness;This tea is delicious. No bitterness, and great flavor.
5;Outstanding and Convenient;The packets are easy to use with no mess. Very little left unpopped and has great flavor.
3;chocolatey goodness;These haven't been available at the stores near here, so I took a chance ordering them. I'm glad I did.
5;Very Good Pasta;Having tried many gluten free pastas we tried this one.  It is by far the one that tastes most like pasta made with semolina wheat.
3;not very yummy;I normally love this dish. It's one of my faves at the local Indian restaurant I frequent.
5;great snack;This is a very good snack when you are watching your weight. It is better to eat healthy sugar-free snack rather than trying to diet without any sweets where you will then get sugar craving and dive into product that has so many calories.
3;Good but has a harsh edge;This is a good basic white tea.  I really enjoy the flavor but the after taste is a bit on the harsher side like a cheap green.
2;Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee;I love Starbucks coffee, it's about all I drink. I usually buy the beans at Costco's and grind them myself and that might make a difference.
1;Terrible;This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.
4;Impressed! But expensive;"I am impressed with the taste. The first thing the ""almond & cashew"" bar reminded me of was pecan pie, yet it doesn't even have any pecans in it."
5;Definitely works!!;"I have tried this product for over a year now and I strongly claim that it works every time. It does have some side effects, like cramping and diarrhea, but as someone else mentioned before ""no pain no gain"" indeed its true."
5;Wonderful flavors;Fantastic tea and flavoring.  It's got a zing to it and is great either hot or cold.
5;Neon Gumballs;Being an event planner you like to see items before you purchase them. I wanted the colors to match my party decor and be a great addition to the candy bar.
5;Extra Tasty Dog Treats;Both my cat and dog love to eat this! ha ha!<br /><br />I guess you must think the cat is underfed? Or bored? Ooooh, I agree. So, I joined a cat toilet training group on the internet!!! Hey, it gives the lazy cat SOMETHING to do! what does YOUR cat do all day? I'm vegan, so, I'm used to all the negative comments.
2;My dog says bleh;I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still,  I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes.
2;Not the greatest;I was hoping I would be a fan, but I had a hard time getting it down.  It just wasn't what I expected.
4;Better than no Hazelnut instant coffee.;This is my favorite instant coffee.  Still miffed that it is no longer available in a jar whereby you could measure the amount you were needing.
5;Coconut + Chocolate = Bliss!;I love coconut water in all its raw incarnations: Brazilian, Thai, Indian. I'm hit or miss with the fruit juice blended beverages of any brand.
4;worth the try;This is definitely an oatmeal cereal. I did not like the little squares at first.
4;Great taste and product value;"I bought this for my wife and she couldn""t believe the outcome!.."
2;Boyds Coffee 100% organic doesn't taste very good...;Like other reviewers- The best restaurant coffee I've ever had was Boyds brewed in a commercial Bunn machine-<br />This isn't the same coffee, and doesn't taste that good (no date on the bags..
5;Love this product!!;"I heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. They a had a $5 coupon code so I figured ""what the heck!""."
3;More expensive than retail;My cat loves this snack but I found out that I had misread the ad.  I thought I would be 3 packs of 6 oz each.
5;Deliciously Simple;I really got this mainly as a mixer. I tend to lean towards the more complex, dessert-y matcha flavors like Pumpkin Pie and Cheesecake, and Earl Grey seemed like it'd be the perfect compliment to a lot of my favorites.
5;My narcotics!;This is the closest thing to European beer snacks in the US! I used to buy Gardetto's Mix just because of those rye bread chips! Finally, they make 'em separately now. Thank you! Contains MSG though, which I'm not really fond of.
5;Great ginger & vanilla flavor and REAL SUGAR!;I just picked up a couple of cans of this in my local supermarket and had my first one today.  Yesterday I had a Mexican Coke and found THAT a bit too sweet for me--although I think it would make a terrific ice cream soda!  This ginger ale was not quite as sweet, and although it DOES taste a bit different than my old favorite Canada Dry I found the taste refreshing.
5;Sweetest I tried;"I have made my own ghee and purchased various brands of ghee. I have also tried traditional Moroccan ghee ""Smen"" and it can be strong and tangy."
5;"Great for ""on the go""";"It's nice to have a healthier option for ""on the go"" snacks for my 15 month old.  Snacks are generally fresh fruits or vegetables but they are too messy for the car so these are a good alternative."
4;REALLY GOOD COFFEE;We keep buying this as it goes on sale.  For the price, you can't beat it.
3;Not as sweet as they could be;I bought these after seeing some reviews.  I wish I had bought a smaller bag to try first.
5;A cooks dream if you want to reduce sodium.;This is a great seasoning.  My dad taught me how to cook and our favorite basic spice combination for meat, fish and poultry is salt pepper and paprika.
4;Surprisingly good;This is surprisingly good.  For someone on a serious diet, or trying to cut back on fat, this is a reasonable way to get a jolt of chocolate .
5;K Pod Drawer;Sturdy, well constructed drawer of wire mesh of good size to hold most size coffee makers and have plenty of storage for 36 K-cup pods of favorite flavors at your fingertips.  A good investment.
5;good fibre low sugar cookie;We just returned from a bike trip in Italy & these cookies were a staple for refueling.  Yum.
5;Birds Custard Powder;I purchased this product along with ultra-fine sugar from Amazon to make a cake called a Rhubarb Custard Tea Cake.  It called for both this custard powder and castor sugar and I had no idea what either one of them were.
5;Healthy good tasting drink;This is my favorite flavor.  I tried others, but this one is the best.
5;Love this granola!;I am always seeking healthy low-carb products, and this one is delicious! It satisfies my sweet tooth, the ingredients are healthy and no artificial sweeteners. And the low net carb count comes from it's high fiber content, which is a definite plus for those of us watching carbohydrate intake.
5;Great product;Have tried all of the 85% and above cocoa and this is the best.  Great price and with my Amazon prime account a very quick delivery.
5;Awesome Gluten free pretzels;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Yum in  a cup;K Cups over all are a little pricey compared to just buying the regular product, I know! But the machine you use to make it ain't exactly cheap either! Having said that..
5;First marathon, they worked great.;I used these gels while training for my first marathon and finally during the marathon 4 days ago.  They were an invaluable tool in helping me finish.
5;Banned by ignorant minds every where;First of all this is a natural product that is collected from healthy food grade livestock.  So your eating a small quanity when ever you eat meat.
5;mmm!;This is my favorite flavor of water so far! I really like cinnamon and cardamom. This is a perfect blend of herbs and is organic with no calories or sugars.
4;THESE ARE GOOD BUT WERE BROKEN.;THESE BISCOTTI COOKIES WERE GOOD BUT THEY ARE SHIPPED IN THIER ORIGINAL CASE WITH NO PROTECTION.  EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THEY ARE FRAGILE AS EGGS THEY ARE NOT TREATED SO BY UPS.
4;hazelnut!!;I love hazelnut smell in my coffee so I figure it will also be great to have it in a cup of hot chocolate. Unfortunately this product doesn't give me a strong hazelnut feeling, just a little.
4;Xylitol Gum Yum;Enjoyed the cinnamon flavor without all the bad calories. The flavor doesn't last terribly long, but how many gums do? A good value for the price.
5;Quick Service and Fresh Candy;The product was delivered quickly and was well packed.  The candy was fresh and tasted good.
3;OK Coffee;This is OK Coffee.  Definitely not the worst coffee I have had, but not the best either.
5;It even helped ME!;I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc.
5;Tastes better than great!!!;No added sugar, low sodium and high in fiber makes this healthy but it really does taste great. The flakes are small but I don't get why that matters as it did to one reviewer, oh well.
4;Not as crunchy as the other Blue Diamond flavors;I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried.
4;Memories;I did not order this online, but years ago they used to sell this in stores. My father absolutely loves this dinner and so do I! As a fan of spicy food this spaghetti is slightly spicy, but it does not overwhelm the taste.
3;Peas are delicious!  ...But its Amazon packaging is ridiculous...;My husband and I both tasted the peas today and they were delicious!  Huge step up over other baby foods we've tried!  Just wish there were more flavors to choose from..
4;Use a French press;I poured boiling water over the pod and worked it over really well with a spoon until the water was good and dark. This produced a good, full bodied coffee with a rich taste.
5;Just as expected;Not much to say here - it's Quaker oatmeal, just in a bigger box than you'd get at the grocery store. My only problem is that there's plain in the box, but that's clearly visible, and I knew it when I bought it.
4;Good Basic Tea;****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas.
5;Tasty;As far as noodles in a cup goes this is one of the best I've had. Actual recognizable small chunks of dehydrated veggies, mostly mushrooms and onions that I could make out.
5;AYURVEDIC ROAST - ORGANIC CAFFEINE SUBSTITUTE;My Mother-in-law loves her morning coffee.  Because of medical conditions she could not have caffeine at all, which the products for non-caffeine on the market do contain caffeine.
2;Bitter taste, roaches;The packaging had roaches, don't know if that is the seller's fault. We threw away the packaging and washed the cans.
5;Great Price!;I used to head to my local gas station and purchase the individual bottles at almost 3 bucks a piece. A friend told me that she buys them off amazon and they come out to half price! You can't beat that! I only like to drink energy shots when I am in NEED of a quick pick me up.
5;City Ham - the best;I love the City Ham! Burger's Smokehouse has amazing products. The customer service people are extremely helpful.
4;positive;el sabroso salsitas chips.  pleased as i am most of time.
1;Mold?;Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food.
5;All Natural Plant Based Power;I have been using this product for about 8 months and will continue using it as supplement because I am lactose intolerant and need a better natural source of protein. This product does not cause me to come up positive for any drug test because I work in the medical industry who conctantly require all employees to be drug free.
5;Great product!;For the price, you really can't beat this as a safe, healthy and delicious (so it seems) dog treat. My girls loved them, and the smell was enough to get them to come right away.
4;Quick AND free shippng!;This product works perfectly for my pups-one with a grain allergy.  It is very easy for us to purchase, as we would have to travel 45 miles to get grain-free food where we live.
3;Slim Jim Chewing Gum;The first one I bit into was tough as leather and I had to rip it with my teeth. I made the mistake of biting it in half, and then I chewed, and chewed, and chewed.
5;Tasty, healthy product with multiple uses;Though I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating and can now be a little more relaxed about my carbohydrate intake (people slam the Atkins plan for being unrealistic, but it's only the initial phases that are truly restrictive), I still keep an eye out for needlessly excessive carb counts.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds are therefore right up my alley.
5;Great Solution For Carrying Splenda - Highly Recommended;"Splenda Minis are a very convenient way to carry Splenda with you when traveling.<br /><br />I mostly use Splenda since the other non-sugar sweeteners have never tasted ""right"" to me, but not every restaurant or person I'm visiting serves it."
5;consistenly good;I like a more robust flavored coffee and try a few different ones. This Tullys Italian Roast consistently delivers.
4;Grade B maple syrup;I bought this product about a month ago and still have it. Its worth buying the 32oz because who wants to keep going to the store? No one! It tastes pretty good and I recommend it.
5;Better 'n Peanut Butter Review - Original and Chocolate flavor;For those who are counting calories and love peanut butter, the Original flavor is is the answer.  You get the flavor of real peanut butter without all the fat and calories.
4;Great for limited diets;My GSD is on a rabbit & sweet potato limited diet from the vet and these cookies are just about the only treat he can have.  They make ME feel better!  My other shepherd, however, isn't crazy for them, but she loves her cookie at night before bed, so she eats them willingly.
5;Still the one;I've been drinking Stash brand Decaf Earl Grey Tea for years now. Very few stores in my area carry this brand, so I decided to order it from Amazon.
5;Two Paws way Up;My dog loves these treats and they help with her aging dog breath.  These arrived fast and fresh.
4;Best noodles out there!;I love these noodles.  Unlike the traditional instant noodles that consist of a fried noodle you add hot water to, these are already hydrated and not fried or dehydrated.
2;about to expire;They taste ok but so close to being expired, i'll never eat all 24 bags by then. Not sending back such a big bulky item.
1;Simply aweful...;I realize this is healthy food for a baby, but the smell alone is bad enough to make any adult sick to their stomach.  After half a spoonful, my daughter started making these gagging noises and proceeded to projectile vomit three times.
5;Love it;I love this oatmeal.  I can't find it in the stores locally so it's wonderful to be able to buy it in a 4-can pack through Amazon.
3;NOT GLUTEN FREE;"These cookies may be ""wheat free"", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients."
5;Taste Great;I purchased this product because I had been diagnosed with H-Pylori.  I had finished the antibiotic therapy but wanted to be sure I was free of the bacteria.
5;both my 9 month old and my 2.5 yr old loves these;One of the first foods my kids ate 'themselves' as they pretty much melt in their mouths.  Somewhat sticky on th e9 month old yet as she's pretty messy with them, but it keeps her happy in her high chair for quite some time.
5;Better than expected;By looking at the picture, the Mickey Mouse face looked a little weird but I took the chance and ordered anyways.  Glad I did.
5;LOVE fresh step products!;When I had just one cat, I considered this to be the best product ever invented. This product absorbs all of the urine in such a way that it doesn't clump and the peed on litter is still usable.
5;A very nice olive oil.;We have used several olive oils, this one is very nice. I stopped my automatic delivery when the price was automatically increased.
3;how fun!;with so many choices, we were on a caffeine high after choosing one of this..
4;Great taste, magical disappearing act.;I have ordered both the Wintergreen and Peppermint versions and for me, the flavors are excellent.<br />However, they perform a disappearing act--the mints dissolve so quickly that, as other reviewers have mentioned, makes them less gratifying and, consequently expensive.
5;very good!;Very good!  I bought this food at my local Chuck and Don's store as a treat for my cat.  I would consider it wet food even though it's not listed as such.
1;"""Regular"" Cola flavor has artificial taste";The regular cola flavor has a terrible diet taste.  I hate artificial sweeteners, just can't get used to the chemical taste.
5;Manuka Honey seems to be working to heal my ulcers;I've finished one jar and have felt somewhat better,now on 2nd and expect to see even more great results.  Good product  Got is coming on automatic shipments.
4;It's Potted Meat, People... You Know it's Good;I grew up eating this stuff as a kid. We would put it on all kinds of stuff.
5;shumanmom;This is a great chocolate bar. sugar free and low carb and great taste.
5;As good as a bagged chunk of noodles and mysterious powder can be;I've been eating Nong Shim Neoguri for about 20 years..
5;Great item;I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product. However, once tried on my twins and they love it! The all natural ingredients, organic nature, and good calorie count (120 in 4 Oz), makes it very appropriate for my kids.
5;Awesome flavor!;I never knew that rice could have such an awesome flavor. I always assumed that rice took on the flavor of whatever you put on it.
3;disappointed that chicken meal is one of leading ingredients;Chicken meal can be those cute little chicks that would have grown to be roosters. (Excess at the hatchery so the little buggers get ground up -often alive- for animal food).
5;Perfect for mini schnauzer;First let me say that every time i read some of the dog food recipes on the labels i begin to think that there are real bits and pieces of fish in the bag. lol but no.
3;Good snack food;My son has severe food allergies and eating issues and really likes this snack.  It does get soggy unless it is eaten within a day or two.
5;Excellent product;I have tried another brand of one cup coffee making.  These made the job easy and no mess.
3;product changed?;We luved original Zico, but now its taste totally different.<br />When introduced it was pure coconut water which was just pasteurized.
5;Xylitol Mega Pack;I love the precautions the seller took to ship this huge bag so that none of the product would leak out. I love knowing that I can store it safely in the reclosable bag.
4;Butler's chocolate is the real deal direct from Ireland;Nifty hot chocolate discs added to your warm milk or milk alternative is simply yum! Made in Ireland so you know the chocolate is high quality.<br /><br />Ingredients for those that desire it (I think it should be a requirement on any listing):<br />Milk chocolate 29% (sugar, whole milk powder, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, emulsifier:soya lecithin, flavouring: natural<br />vanilla), Cocoa mass 25%, Invert sugar syrup, Sugar syrup, sugar, water, preservtive:sorbic acid), Sweetened condensed<br />milk (milk, sugar).
5;Note to Self: Do not eat a Pound Yourself;This bacon is smokey, tender, and very lean.  It cooks evenly and goes well with burgers, on BLTs, or solo.
5;The absolute best so far!;I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack.<br />For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.
2;Not as great as I thought it would be;I tried EB's other meals and this was not as good. I love their fruits and veggies but this gourmet stuff, my son would not eat.
5;Great tasting cookies!;I guess I will swallow anything according to the other reviewer?  Good to know.  Anyway, this review is based on taste only, not nutritional value or any of the other qualities or selling points of these cookies.
5;VERY tasty!!;We use this coffee at home with our espresso machine and at work using our regular coffee maker. The taste is EXCELLENT! This product truly deserves all the stars it has.
5;Mmmm dead animals;What can I say this turns roadkill into tasty tasty roadkill.  Pity you can't buy it in Australia will have to travel back to USA when I run out.
5;Waited a long time for this product!;With all the health issues I have at least I know spices in food make it a bit more tolerable. Cutting back on salt is a big issue for me, as well as sugar due to diabetes! So, imagine if you can my joy at finding a line of spices that take health into consideration.
5;Great collector's piece;I am a Pac-Man fan from way back and when I saw this can of energy drink, I had to add it to my collection.  It makes a fine piece of memorabilia for any collector of Pac-Man, 80's, or soda cans.
4;I can't call it coffee but it hits the spot when you're stuck;It's not gonna compare to a brewed cu pof coffee, let alone a cup from your local roaster but when I was restricted from caffeine consumption the nose of the Folgers was what I needed to get me through me day.<br /><br />I bring some when I go camping too, since I need that coffee-like start to my day but don't actually want the caffeine.
4;Awesome Chips;I love these chips they are the best chips at a low price to pay because they are baked.Only 3 points for weight watchers member's for 1ounce which is about 20 chips and there are 3ounces in this bag.
5;Never Going Back;Having used clumping clay litter for two years for my older cat, I was tired of the dust and smell. I got a kitten, so that meant double the scooping.
5;This Works to lower cholesterol;This product allows us who can't take Staten's a chance to lower our cholesterol. Flavor is caramel and texture is like a tootsie roll.
3;Fluffy Slenda;Splenda is one of my favorite sweatners but it's diffecult to use because it has the consistancey of ground styrofoam. Exhaling on it can blow it away if it's not wet and getting it wet is not eazy.
5;AWESOME BREAD!!;This flour makes a VERY delicious loaf of bread, which is fast becoming my favorite!!<br /><br />The recipe I use calls for 2 cups of Kamut and 1 cup of white (I use Wheat Montana white).  All four loaves I have made - using my Zojirushi bread maker - have exceeded my expectations.
5;Delicious;These are the best pretzels I've eaten. They taste great.
5;Expensive, but I don't know how to make horchata.;This Horchata drink tasted just as good as the many many Mexican Restaurants I have been to in Texas. It is more on the cinnamon side than most I think.
1;Smells nice, but leaves you dirty;I'm typically a bar soap kind of guy, Irish Spring or Dial depending on the day. I got some of this to try though and I was pretty stoked.
5;A Touch of Elegance;It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in.
5;Great Macaroons;Written review.<br /><br />Coconut macaroons are a favorite of mine and I was delighted to find out that Amazon was carrying this delicious Archway product.
5;Equally healthy and great tasting;Bought these because they had the extra promotion and since i was going back to school, i needed something for the mornings when i'm on the run. These cookies are great.
4;Not an even Variety Pack;You will get 60 cups of cereal.  Each cup gives you enough cereal and space to pour a 6-8oz of milk.
5;Not sweet;My daughter does not like sweets and I don't like foods high in sugar so this works out for both of us. My daughter loves the taste and texture, lightly sweet, soft and much less chewy than Rice Krispies treats.
4;Healthy and convenient;Tastes great and is convenient for those days that I am in a rush and need to bring my lunch to work.  Although it is rather high in sodium, I rinse it well and mix with organic broccoli slaw,and lite safflower mayo for a healthy meal.
5;Strong Chewers Delight;Good Buddy rawhide chews have been a staple for our strong chewing dogs for ages. Before Castor & Pollux took the reigns we purchased the larger rawhide sticks because they lasted a good 15 minutes or more of tough no-holds-barred chewing
1;Yuck!;I still feel sick to my stomach. They are very salty and the aftertaste is terrible.
5;The whole family loves these.;I buy these and the other flavors by the case for my kids. They make the perfect healthy grab and go snack.
2;Not impressed;My 8 month old labradoodle prefers the one that is round (another brand). The square design on this one makes him scoot it around which seems to lose his interest rather quickly.
5;Greenie Treats;My little girl doggie loves these..
5;Good for powerful chewers;I ordered these for my two Boston terriers, both of whom chew and tearup most soft toys. Now I only get them powerful chewing toys, but the chew product must have a flavor or they lose interest fast.
5;Perfect Peanut Butter;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Best natural energy boost I've ever taken;Although this product does have an abundance of vitamin b12, which can be bad for the liver over a long period of using it, it is an AMAZING energy and moood booster.  I use it pre workout when I goto the gym a lot, and it is unreal how fast it will kick in.
5;Exactly what I needed;For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.
5;Great Product!;This is my first time trying this product and it is great.  I'm not always able to buy expresso beans locally so this will satisfy my cravings and be also available for baking.
4;Can't Eat Just One!;Ok after eating Blair's Death Rain Hot Wing chips this is like eating a cracker. That aside, these are a pretty good chip, especially if you don't like `em hot and spicy.
5;MY YORKIES LOVE THESE;MY YORKIES LOVES THESE BETTER THAN THE CHICKEN TENDERS. THEY ARE SMALL AND THEY CAN BE BROKEN UP FOR THEM TO EAT.
5;Delicious;I find I have grown somewhat addicted to having one of these crisps every morning with my coffee - they're not terribly filling because the crisps are relatively thin, but if like me you just need a little something to munch on in the morning these are the perfect pick.  Easy to grab and go, delicious, crunchy, all that you could look for in the morning.
5;You Can't Go Wrong With This;I have a 100# weimer that is a big chewer and he loves this product.  One of the things I loved about it is the product has a money back guarantee and the seller sent a sample of another product they have.
5;Kind Plus Cranberry & Almond Bars;These bars are delicious.  Not heavy on the stomach with just enough sweetness to satisfy.
4;For a whole bean lover, this decaf is pretty good.;This is the first decaf coffee that I have purchased that I actually enjoy.  Purchased on sale and with a $1.
4;Happy Baby Organic Puffs;Love these puffs. Have a lot less sugar than the Gerber Graduates puffs, and baby doesn't seem to notice the difference.
1;Don't Bother;This is something you can pick up at wal-mart for 98 cents (I have, unfortunately). It's hotter than most generic hot sauces, but the taste is terrible.
5;Love this!;I've been eating Hodgson Mill Milled Flaxseed and Soy Hot Cereal for over a year - was on a subscription with Amazon to get it regularly because I really liked it. But I was ready for a change and decided to try the Bulgur Wheat.
5;Great Sauce w/o the extreme heat!!!;I love asian flavor w/o the extreme heat.  I had this sauce w/ some wings at Mellow Mushroom in Knoxville, TN.
5;We Love Nonni's!;We just love Nonni's Biscotti products -- especially the limone!  It's always refreshing -- not too sweet/not too tart.  Finding them on Amazon was exciting because we haven't found them locally since coming to Florida.
4;Wolfgang Puck Coffee - Sumatra Kopi Raya for Keurig;"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon."
1;Disappointing;I bought a huge bottle of this from GFS in order to have it on hand for cooking. Big mistake, this stuff is more savory than sweet and sour.
5;Delicious!;I am very impressed with this green tea. I used to work in a specialty coffee and tea shop and I know for a fact that they spent much more for tea of this same caliber.
1;No ifs, ands or butts;I've got both hands and 9 of 10 fingers on the pulse of my mutt, as I'm sure most people reading this do. One must assume that a person reading reviews on dog treats loves their buddy.
5;Strange Brew's Cooper's Irish Beer Kit;Kit arrived in as described condition. After brewing this kit I'm very pleased with it.
1;Tastes sour;We just got this today and couldn't take more than one sip each. Even smelling it after, it smells like it has gone bad.
5;IT WORKED!;my very VERY fussy cats gobbled up the chicken flavored ones, along with the med inside it! and my cats don't even like their regular food changed. still can't believe it was so easy! used to try everything including tuna with oil (no luck) but i followed the other comments and made sure i molded it around the med so it didn't show.
5;Sadie loves this;My 3 1/2 month old kitten Sadie just loves this food.  She has lots of energy and none of the bloat that other foods gave my other cats.
4;Not Shocked;Good aroma and good flavor, but did not shock me.  I compared this coffee to Starbucks.
5;Wonderful Tea;I use red clover tea a lot and so do my friends, it helps cure insomnia and is also known as a cleanser of the body organs. I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and cheerful after I use it, which is between once a week and once a month.
5;Delicious!;I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.
4;Delicious, but a little pricey;I LOVE THIS SNACK =D Its like eating crunchy chips but they're sweet and so much healthier. I would eat them all the time, but they just add up- but don't most healthy foods? Sad truth :(.
4;Chewy, sweet-n-tart, with a bit of a grassy aftertaste;These are like a funky healthful candy--cherry tart/sweet and chewy. The aftertaste is a bit grassy, which I find a tad odd, but the after-aftertaste is a nice cherry residue--like when you've had a strong tart-sweet cherry candy, like a Jolly Rancher.
5;Great Taste and Reasonably Priced;I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.
5;Consistently Good Darjeeling Tea;I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.
1;Greasy;This stuff has as its first ingredient petrolatum, which certainly sounds like a petroleum product. Then comes mineral oil and then paraffin.
3;Not enthused;I found this product no better than store bought liverwurst.<br />The bead on the can is too small for for my side cutter can opener as well as the old stand by hand crank.
5;she loves it;My 14 month old loves this stuff.  i tasted it and it seems healthy and delicious enough.
5;Best Coffee Outside a Coffee Shop;Of all the coffee flavors I have tried with my Keurig, Rainforest Espresso is the best.  It has great depth of flavor without bitterness.
5;You want fiber?  GG's got tons of it.;It would probably be better to not think of these as crackers so much as a convenient fiber suppliement.  These crackers look exactly like particle board.
5;Amazing Price;We used to buy this Chai in a coffee shop for my wife and it was 10 dollars for a very small bag. This is a great deal.
5;"This salt blows away ""Real"" salt!";I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling.
5;Delicious Salt;What can I say?  The ocean air has a fragrance, and this salt has a flavor--and it is a delicious one.  This isn't a salt for mixing into the pot, but for sprinkling over roasted veggies or anything in which the moist crystaline texture can stand out.
5;Irresistable;This is the ultimate treat for my dogs..
4;Tasty, quick and easy, and a good boost to immune system;I received one tube of this drink mix via the Amazon Vine program.  I mixed it with water and liked the fizzy-ness of it.
5;Vanilla Icecream;I am 70 years old and I have tried a lot of different Vanilla favors over the years and this<br />has the most intense favor.This turns Icecream into heaven.
1;cats won't eat it;Not sure what it is - but our cats won't touch the stuff. They do tend to like seafood more - so maybe that's what it is.
5;Don't be fooled, this is not what you get in the supermarket;"Like so many things in Italy, the Italians have elevated this vinegar-making to high art.<br /><br />This product, ""Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia"", is made from cooked grape ""must"" that is aged over many years while it is transfered into ever smaller barrels of different woods."
5;Very tasty but not very Habanero-y;"This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming."
1;My Black Labrador throws up the new formula of Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food;My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.
5;Wonderful lavender!;This was great Lavender!  My entire room, smelled of wonderful lavender, as soon as I opened the box!  The color was beautiful and the bundles were very large.  I have ordered Lavender several times before from other companies, and the bundles I received were never as large as this!  Also, be aware that I have previously purchased Lavender (which had been ordered, from other rather large companies,) and it was old and smelled moldy upon receipt.
5;Very good noodles;My whole family loved these noodles.  My kids did notice a difference between these and their standard Ramen noodles, but they said they liked them and ate the whole bowl.
5;Awesome;Got these for the holidays because we were having so many people over and I didn't want to spend forever making these by hand so I bought these.  They were excellent, right consistency right mixture would recommend these for anyone who love gnocchi.
5;Good stuff;I'm on a no-sugar diet right now and this stuff is a life saver.  I add about 10 drops to a bottle of water and it gives me the sweetness I need.
2;Not impressed by this tea;I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.
5;Miracle Noodle=WOW;I have used the noodle in several recipes and truly impressed with the versatility.<br />  I started with stir fry and was satisfied with the taste but found the leftovers fantastic.
5;***Miraculous!***;Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems.  Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing.
5;Great cereal even for those who eat gluten;I am a cereal maniac.  I eat it every morning.
3;Not the best;Due to reviews across the net and consumerreviews along with examining the ingredients I switched my black lab, Jade, to this food.  Jade is ok with the taste, not crazy about it.
4;Slim Jims;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great Tea;I love English breakfast tea, but have found some of them bitter.  This is the best one I have found so far.
3;Great Store Bought Cookies;I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try out and ended up really liking them. I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also.
5;Great stuff!;I read a lot of reviews before I had had enough of the overkill. This is good stuff.
5;Good;Can't beat the price and convenience of buying online.  Don't have to waste gas and time going to the grocery store anymore for baby food.
5;Good Flavor;I love earl grey tea, but am very picky & find that the flavor quality varies from each supplier, & some are not so good.  Stash is always consistantly good, and the flavor is just right.
4;Fogchaser Coffee;Bold and rich. LOVE this coffee for a fast wake-me-up in the morning, and pick-me-up mid day.
3;I really wanted to like these more ...;After receiving these today, I once again gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.<br /><br />First, let me describe them.
5;depends on the cat;I bought this for my girlfriend's cat to try to get it used to a scratching post. Her cat could care less about the catnip.
5;Simply Wild dog food;Simply Wild dog food is a tiny kibble, suitable for a small dog like my Yorkie.<br />Better yet, he loves it.
2;where's the taste?;I thought this kettle corn lacked taste.  There was no sweet/salty mix that you usually get with kettle corn.
3;check the expiration date!;When I buy these in the grocery store, I have roughly a year before the expiration date. These however, expire less than 3 months after I got them.
5;Decadently Delicious!!!;All the Larabars I have tried have been wonderful but the Coconut Cream Pie ones are absolutely decadent!!! They taste as yummy as your grannie's Coconut Cream pie did with none of the guilt. The taste is sweet but not overwhelmingly so.
2;Not as described!;The basket was sent to a friend. There was a specific reason why I chose this basket, being the frog -Prince Charming- and they sent a basket with a teddy bear.
1;Wayyyy too salty! Blah!;Wish I didn't purchase so much before trying it first. May be good for a sore throat in small amounts, I suppose, but I would rather have a progresso soup before this again.
5;Very good hot chocolate.;I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.
5;Dog loves Bunny Bits;My dog goes crazy for these bunny bits - I let two bits roll on the tile floor and he chases after them before eating them. He is critter driven so anytime I can make something fun - he is for it.
5;EXCELLENT VALUE;I received the package today with free shipping and no tax.  Expiration march 2012.
3;Just another shampoo;Was excited to try this shampoo due to the volumizing claims. I have very thick, heavy hair that just hangs there, so am always on the lookout for something to pump up the volume! Maybe it would work on someone with finer hair, but it did not give me the hoped-for results.
5;Love it!;This is not flakey like the Murray River Sea Salt (which is more uniform in size), but rather, some flakes, some chunks, not especially uniform, but that doesn't take away from this salt at all. It's very crunchy, and has a great saline flavor that I like.
5;Fresh and Tasty;These sunflower seeds are larger than the standard sunflower seeds you can usually find in your local supermarket (usually the David's brand in my area) so there's more inner seed to eat.  There's also a lighter coating of salt from the brine wash on them, so while there's enough salt to make things tasty, your lips aren't going to go numb from all the salt quite as quickly as with the other brand.
4;Good in a Pinch when on the Go at the Office;I like Green Mountain coffee and have for quite some time. These K-Cup packs seem to lack the punch of freshly brewed Green Mountain in can get at your local neighborhood convenience store.
5;Great Tea Great Price;We drink alot of green tea mixed with our homemade ginger tea.  This was the best priced organic green tea from all sources we tried.
5;Excellent and Different!!;This popcorn is really fresh and yummy! It is very easy to mix together too.  My favotites were the Lemon and Sea Salt and Vermont Maple and Sea Salt.
5;Great customer service;3 of the 4 jars of coconut oil had leaked into the packaging because the lids were not on tight which made the outside of the jars oily.  I had to clean the outside of the jar with hot soapy water.
5;deez nutz.;great deal on these nuts. whole family loves these nuts.
5;Love them!;These are soooo good. You can taste the caramel and the green apple.
1;Why the white tea blend?;I really cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with Celestial Seasoning's having ruined its perfectly good green tea. The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea.
1;Horrible quality;The shipment I received had soooooo much powder it made the tea undrikable.  Looks like all the great reviews are older.
4;The Jalapeno Story;I love the taste of jalapenos but not if they're too hot. My grandfather used to eat jalapeno sandwiches with white bread.
5;Addictive!;These sunflower seeds are incredible.  They are not as hot as one would assume.
5;Brings back memories of my Mother's lemon pies;My sister and I were discussing how delicious the pies (especially lemon) our Mother baked when we were young. We remembered that she always used My-T-Fine  fillings.
5;Best instant, and better price than in-store;A smooth, mellow flavor
5;PB2 LOVE!;I heard about this product through a friend and decided to give it a try. Peanut butter without the fat, yes please! I found this product to be delicious and use it mainly in refrigerator oatmeal.
4;Great cost-performance;This looked like more of a woman's sort of product, so I gave it to the missus to try out. Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level.
1;Worthless;I bought some toys I thought my kitten would play with which didn't have catnip in them. Others I bought did.
5;Great hot tea!;I have always enjoyed drinking this tea and I had a hard time keeping it in stock. So, I ordered enough to last a while at the same price I would have given for it at the grocery store.
5;Greatest Chips;What a treat! I've ordered these several times and keep comin' back for more! Organic, cheesy and delicious..
3;smaller teabags inside the 1150 teabags;"I purchased these teabags thinking they were regular size teabags, as in 2 servings per bag, which at some point in time was how they were made. After I open the large bag 1150 size I notice the actual teabag is much smaller than what I was use to and read on the bag ""one cup pyramid teabags"" written underneath the 1150."
5;An exotic indulgence;"I've loved rooibos tea since I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;A bland hot sauce;For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.
5;Not the hottest, but the flavor is unrivaled.;"This has got to be the best ""hot"" sauce ever where flavor is concerned.  If you buy one of Blair's other hotter sauces you can add a bit of them to increase this sauces heat to your liking."
5;Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams...;The product was fresh and tasty.  Having grown up on Nabisco's Graham Crackers, I found these to have a different texture than Nabisco's.
5;Very good!;I love stevia and was looking for a little something to add some different flavors to my coffee. This stuff smells fantastic! It is great in my coffee, but I discovered an even better use for it.
5;This thing is a Godsend;I own a 3 year old pemmy corgi and this thing is just the best thing since wet dogfood to him. If I put the ball with 2 treats in it in front of him, I know he is going to be busy for the next 2-3 hours just licking it.
5;Very, very gingery;This hot beverage tastes like a liquid version of candied ginger, which I like very much. I liked this drink, too
4;my absolute favorite;this really has a nice, buttery, toffee flavor that comes through. i find a lot of the other coffees are all aroma with weak flavor.
5;Best food for sensitive tummies;Since we first got our dog, a Siberian Husky named River, she always have reactions to everything. She first had a reaction to the chicken in the puppy food.
5;Does anyone NOT like Nutella?;Just YUM! great to have these on the go - I found at a gas station on a monthly 6 hour drive with my daughter. What a hit for us both.
5;Hard to find;Lingonberries are great with rotisserie chicken.  They are almost impossible to fine in the supermarkets.
5;THIS food does taste good!;These are very addicting tortilla chips!  So good, in fact, that we get them automatically every three months now.  Yummy.
5;Rainbow of Lollipops;I love picking up lollipops for myself and as treats for my children for a job well done.  The children can't tell the difference between the sugar gluten free and the ones with sugar.
1;Please bring back old formula....;I will not purchase cytomax again until the old formula is brought back. The new stuff tastes terrible! Please bring back the old formula.
5;Clearly,the best I have tried;My hair was so `fly away' that it had its own zip code. I tried many brands of conditioners.
2;Not so good...;These are just like any other noodles..
5;Good Stuff!;"A friend gave me a couple of these ""energy"" type bars last year and I immediately liked them a lot. But the prices at the local health stores and bicycle/mountain stores prohibited me from buying them as much as I wanted to."
2;Love Coffee People, but Not Jet Fuel;Let me begin by saying I am a huge Coffee People fan.  My wife is from Oregon and anytime we visited her family my first priority was visiting one of their shops.
3;Average Chip...;Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor.
5;Excellent.;My dog loves these.  As far as dog treats go, these are pretty healthy.
5;Kay's Naturals Protein Chips;I love the spicey taste of these snack chips. They have lots of protein and are quite filling.
5;Innovative, healthy and YUMMY!;We love these HappyTots! The flavors are wonderful and the added Salba grain is a great way to add nutrients. My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time.
5;Bubble gum;These are really hard to find in my town so it is great to be able to order them and get what I want quickly. My granddaughters love them so I have to have them.
5;Good value and quality;I have dietary restrictions, so almond flour is about the only flour I can use.  Trader Joe's sells a pretty cheap one, but it's not blanched, which is not as easy to digest for me.
5;Pizza Worth Ordering Online;I've made this pizza kit several times and keep coming back to it.  It is better than the do-it-yourself pizza crusts you can buy in grocery stores, plus it's organic and whole wheat, so I definitely prefer it.
5;Best Stir Fri, Thai Peanut and Gluten Free!;Thai Peanut Is the perfect gluten free meal, easy and quick to make it's very delicious.  The best Thai stir-frys I've ever made.
5;Great Chipolte Flavor;I first found these little cubes at WalMart [our local WalMart no longer carries them, don't know why]. They are great when added to refried beans, Mexican rice, chili and many other dishes.
5;Best Fat Free Hot Cocoa Mix ever!!;Was able to purchase this item in grocery stores in Oklahoma City.  Not so after I moved to Cape Coral.
5;Perfect sweet and wholesome snack!;I love Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds!  These are just perfect sprinkled over yogurt and it keeps you full all morning.  Also, they are just sweet enough without being sticky sweet.
5;fantastic!! My favorite Tea;Wish this was available all year long. This tea is fatastic alone or with cream.
5;Smooth Dark Roast with WAKE-UP Power!;"Really like this bold roast - it isn't bitter at all, and has no ""burnt"" taste like some dark roasts. It has extra caffeine, exactly what's needed at times."
5;The brand makes a difference;I didn't know there was a difference between brands of gelatin.  I had gotten this brand through the Radiant Life company ([.
5;Not bad once you give it a chance;First off don't be put off by the name as so many people are. It is a joke.
5;3 Years & Still Works Great;I received this as a gift back in 2008 and it still works great. I take the batteries out of it between uses and store it in the box it came in.
5;Great tea, when you don't need the caffeine kick!;I'm a regular tea drinker - 5 - 7 cups a day.  I love green tea.
4;Good, but try the Extra Fresh flavor;My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better.
5;rice;Very good rice - fun too.  It is between the texture of white rice and wild rice.
1;Don't be fooled;Don't be misled by the fact that the description says that this is a pack of 10..
5;Good Stuff!;The Stash Tea Company seems to make excellent products.  Everything I've ever tried from them is a quality product.
5;Great bags;I have purchased these bags before and find them perfect for the compost bins that the city of SanFrancisco provides. They are strong and leak-proof and definitely do the job well.
5;My dogs love them;I had been looking for a chicken jerky product that was made in the USA and came across this one.  While the cost is considerably higher than the chicken jerky products made in China, the peace of mind is worth it for me.
2;Starbucks should stick to coffee.;I picked this up at my supermarket thinking the kids and I were in for a real treat
5;BEST COFFEE EVER!!!!!!;BEST COFFEE EVER..
5;Love this;This tastes like the candy Toffifay without the carmel. Love to eat a spoonful of it right out of the jar.
5;Light and tasty;If you appreciate coffee with a social conscience and you want a delicious light blend, this is for you. The little pods are fine for making a 4 oz coffee but anything larger will be too pale for most people's taste.
4;Cat food;This canned cat food is my cat's favorite, and I'm happy to be able to feed it to her. Given what I have read about non-organic cat food, I hope this continues to be available.
2;smells weird;this tortilla has a really weird smell so I couldnt even eat it. It would have been great if it smelled better.
4;Terrible Delivery from Amazon;We usually order this from Petco because our cat has health problems and can only eat specific types of cat food. Ordering online at Amazon is easier and cheaper.
4;Its Worth a Try;50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway.
4;Great alternative to peanut butter!;"I made peanut ""butter"" out of this flour and it was surprisingly good!  You need to put salt and/or sweetner on it, but that is to one's taste.  Personally, I like it just plain."
4;Insanely Hot!;I really liked this hot sauce, it is incredibly hot. It's perfect for pranking friends with, if you're looking for something like that.
5;Chicken Soup for the Cat's Soul;"Although my cat is not a finicky eater, he really loves Weruva's Grandma's Chicken Soup! Because I need to get more liquid into his diet (he has been diagnosed with struvite crystals and needs to ingest more liquid), this soupy food is the perfect way to do that. And finally, I like this cat food because it is ""real"" food, not chopped up by-products like many cat foods."
5;great treats;These are the best training treats you can buy.  My dog is more motivated in doggie class because of these treats than any other dog in class.
5;Tasty!;It's somewhat hard to find a Macadamia Syrup but I happen to love this particular flavor.  My first order off Amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so I gave this one a try and I'm happy I did!  It's quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch.
5;Great Chew Treats for Dental Cleaning!;These chew treats are great and my cat loves them. I have not been able to find them at any retail locations and get them exclusively with KV VetSupply.
5;Excellent Flavor;This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.
5;Restaurant quality Tropical Tea at home;I was in a restaurant in Long Beach the other day and loved the Iced Tea.  I asked the food server what the brand was and he went back and wrote it down for me.
5;Love these;I got these at a store and I love these potato chips, they taste really great. So I thought I'd leave a review on Amazon.
3;Soak the beans!;This product has potential to be 5 Stars, if they would just make one change on the directions.  You need to soak the beans overnight!<br />I made this soup yesterday and after the suggested two hours of cooking, the lentils, peas and beans were still rock hard.
5;Cat loves it!;Our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too. I have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house.
5;AWESOME;Awesome meat substitute. Great taste and texture.
3;Not as pretty as in the picture;It arrived on time and manner, although for the picture I got from the person who received it, is not what I was expecting, the flowers were quite different and it looks a lot smaller. The receipient was happy, but I was not since I expected something else.
5;Great tasting low fat peanut butter;PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks.
3;Not as advertised;This made a nice bread but there were no raisins.  They didn't say to add your own raisins either.
5;Good Stuff;I ordered the 5 hour energy drink from Amazon because it is cheaper than buying it one bottle at a time.  This product is great when you need to stay alert for 5 hours.
2;Quality suffering. Cracks abound.;I have been using Satin Ice for many years, but lately, the quality has diminished. Cracks appear almost immediately.
5;Yummy!! Onion & Garlic;I've tried quite a few different sprout seeds.  This one is hands down the best! The smell as they are sprouting is almost good enough to satisfy a hunger.
5;This tea is tops.;This is one of my favorite teas.  The double dose of Bergamot gives this Earl Grey a wonderful flavor.
5;Gourmet gift basket;Ordered it for my mom's birthday. She lives in Texas.
5;Excellent buy;Very sturdy, nice padding, easy to use. Note - a bit taller than it looks.
5;The best boy fun!;My 8 year old got these for Christmas and loved them every second until they were gone. These are jelly belly jellybeans that look identical to each other- good tasting ones and bad tasting ones.
5;Great Coffee!;I think this is a little known brand of coffee, but it beats Senseo's  by a mile! I'm glad Senseo was on backorder - I was tempted to try The Pod. It's a very full-bodied coffee, but smooth.
1;To salty, dident microwave right.;I am a lover of pork rinds so i was really looking forward to eating fresh ones, neathers to say they dident cook in 5 mins like it says it would and if you put it in that long most would burn to a crisp by that time, another thing that really dident appel to me is that the taste is like they poured tones of salt on them before they packaged them..
4;Short Review Followed by a HEADS UP;I'm on my second order and I can't say much other than i love this stuff. It tastes just like their beef jerky, which comes free with an order of their chew, and it keeps my munchies at bay.
5;Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar;The bar is perfect for on the go on a busy work day or just a delicious and healthy snack. It is made with real bananas and almonds.
5;One of the Best Hot Sauce in my collection;For some reason the local stores I visit no longer carry this brand of hot sauce, not sure why?. I was fortunate to find it online and it was shipped very promptly.
3;Just OK;A little disappointed.  The ravioli taste OK, but too few of them.
5;Kettle chips are excellent;Kettle is the best tasting and healthiest chips I have tried. Keep buying them so Amazon keeps stocking them.
5;Love Via!;I truly love this product and always carry it with me when I travel.  My only complaint is the packaging used on the product which is sold at Costco, which contains 24 packets.
5;Love these a little too much;These are a great little snack and at 110 calories are in my daily calorie range. The problem is they are a little too good.
2;Very disappointed;The filling in both bones I received was unacceptable. The filling was crumbly and fell out onto my floor when I opened the packages.
5;best chewy for your best friend;I breed Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Having young large breed dogs around your home can be a chore all by it's self.
4;My Dog Loves These;My dog loves these flossies.  They are like a bully stick, but a little more of a challenge to chew.
2;Not happy;When the package arrived it contained only a broken ceramic bowl, a pot of dirt, bag of rocks, and two pieces of wire mesh.  No tools, book nor plant was included.
5;Tastes great, no BPA;Tastes great, no BPA in the liner. We like to shop locally but our food co-op doesn't carry these which are the only brand without BPA in the can liner.
5;These will be habit forming!;I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring? Then all of a sudden, within seconds, it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy. As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.
5;BEST. SAUCE. EVER.;Screw hot sauce, I put THIS stuff on everything! Add it to chicken, rice, beef, pasta, your shoe, or ANYTHING you're cooking to add flavorful spice. Hot sauce is alright, but it's actually kind of bland compared to sriracha.
2;Very Large Tin of Grape Vine Leaves;The stuffed grape vine leaves were great. The only problem that I encountered was that the can was very, very, very large.
5;Nourishing, Healthful, Deliscious;Experts agree that conventional salt, sea salt, and himalayan crystal salt are very different substances. All three have been analyzed microscopically and nutritionally.
5;Delicious!;This tea is like having a slice of pumpkin pie without the guilt or calories ..
3;Awesome. I like a sweet n hot BBQ sauce;
5;One of Gevalia's best;I've tried many varieties of coffees from Gevalia, but I keep coming back to this Traditional Roast as one of my very favorites. Highly recommended.
5;good pricing;Can't comment on the cereal itself, as it is Honey Comb cereal, just as you'd buy at the store.  But, I really like being able to save money by getting some food items from Amazon, cause where I live, cereal is over $6 per box.
3;3rd eyelid problem;I have 2 cats that I slowly introduced Evo to.  One cat does fine with increasing percentages of Evo, while the other cat, even with small amounts of Evo, had terrible diarrhea, flatulence, and she started showing her 3rd eyelids.
4;A nice alternative to other breakfast bars;After eating cereal and breakfast bars for so long, I wanted to try something different so I ordered this. Of course, I questioned the idea of a breakfast cookie however, I was pleasantly surprised.
5;This is good stuff!!!;We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him.
4;Not like Grandma's but Quite Good.;Lipton Soup from Canada has another winner in there Veggie Soup. I originally bought the Chicken Noodle with White Meat and thought it was great for a powdered Soup and a quick alternative to coffee.
3;Good Gummis But For The High Price Was Expecting More;After I got the techno gummis along with this I was amazed at how unique the techno gummis taste was and was expecting about the same thing with the mini-frogs, but except for their marshmallow bellies the mini-frogs were just the same as the gummi bears you get at the store and in all to me they were like the shark gummis I can get at the convenient stores as well.  The bag is humongous and holds a great quantity so kudos for that but still I felt a little cheated that for this price I just got what amounted to five pounds of marshmallow gummi bears, and while I loved the techno gummis and have ordered another bag seeing as how my family and I have almost finished the bag I really doubt I will reorder this again unless the price goes a little more down to a reasonable price for this usual treat that's pretty much available at almost every store.
5;REAL pretzels, finally!;"After searching and finding many gross gluten free pretzels, subpar gluten free pretzels, and even ones that ""will do"" because I have to have GF, I've been frustrated and almost didn't buy these.  But, I did."
4;Gluten Free Sugar Cone;Received ontime.  Very sweet taste.
4;bad packaging;The product its self if great, it tastes good in my coffee. However the resealable pouch is hardly that.
5;Delicious!;These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.
5;packs a punch!;First truly full bodied and strong coffee I have encountered with my new KCup machine.  Strong enough for the 11 ounce setting, coming from a heavy Starbucks/ Peets Coffee drinker.
2;Different Wrapper;The wrapper shown is not the exact one we received.  Tangy candy tastes ok.
5;Awesome;We love the Tortuga Rum Cakes.  Never have had a bad experience with their products.
4;Good but had a slightly odd taste;This cereal  is really good, however as I was eating it, I had an odd taste in my mouth. But I couldn't really tell what it was from.
5;Love this tea;This is my new favorite tea. It is absolutely delicious and even after it's sat and gotten cold, it's good.
5;Ragu Pasta Sauce;My favorite one. I am very happy with this spaghetti sauce.
4;Nice beauty product - plastic jar;I use this as a skin moisturizer and love the way it feels and smells!  Does a good job keeping my hands moisturized.  Need to reapply a couple times throughout the day, but it's worth the tradeoff that it's all natural without any weird chemicals, unlike the lotions you find the the personal care section.
2;Tastes a little cardboardy and does contain sugar;I was looking for a good instant organic plain oatmeal and settled for this variety due to added flax seed. I was a little disappointed with the taste.
5;no 'skinny' taste here...just WONDERFUL;These are out of this world.  A welcome treat everyday!  Best 120 calorie snack out there, by far!  Hard to just eat one pouch.
1;Awful!!;"I am so upset that I didn't read the reviews first before buying this coffee.  I ""assumed"" all k-cups had coffee grounds inside."
2;dry tasteless;I bought these on the basis of other reviews and I'm so sorry. They're dry and tasteless at best, weird chemical tasting at worst.
5;Better Bowls sweetened with SPLENDA;Fits perfectly into my diabetic diet without having to consume Nutrasweet.  I'm one of the unfortunate few who should not ingest Nutrasweet.
1;Heartbreaking;Huge disappointment. I had been salivating the entire time from order to delivery but I can't even finish the first box.
5;Top of the samples line;"This coffee came with the ""starter pack"" for our Keurig coffeemaker and was near the last of the pack to be sampled.  It rated 5/5 and #2 of 25 by Dad and #3 by Mom."
5;YUM!;I've always been a huge fan of regular Jolly Ranchers. In fact, when I was in third grade our teacher used to give them to us as a treat, and ever since then I've been a big fan.
5;Dents don't matter;Fine product at a great price.  Seems that some city folk don't understand that dents don't matter, it's not a plasma t.
5;This water contains healing energy.  Love it!;My personal experience is that this water is energizing and increases a feeling of well-being. It has a stabilizing effect.
5;Super Yummy;I love these chips! They are lower in fat but better in taste that most other chips. The price is right too at the case price.
1;THESE ARE NOT VEGETARIAN;I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.
4;Warning: will cause bad breathe (but oh, so delicious);These chips are very very good. The flavoring on them is the perfect bbq flavor.
5;Every thing good for you and tasty too!;Sometimes granola can taste a little like sweetened wood chips with a few nuts and raisins thrown in. It's good for you but not particularly pleasant.
5;Can't live without it!!;Love this brand and wouldn't buy anything different!!  Spices are perfect!  It's best with vanilla soymilk.  Makes my day.
5;Kept my BRT busy;We love this product. We have a BRT puppy who goes through chewies like crazy, and we wanted to get away from using them.
5;Excellent, wish Safeway still carried it;This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.
5;excellent dog food;We have two dogs and they love those shredded chicken parts. I highly recommend this brand because of the high quality of its ingredients.
5;32 ounce GF International Chai Tea Latte;This is a lot of product.  I transferred the powder mixture to canisters to keep fresh.
5;Robust medium brew;Nantucket blend is robust without being harsh. I can use it on the largest setting on my Keurig, and it does not taste diluted.
1;Diarrhea;My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own
5;Great Chew Treat;These chews are great.  My little Shi-Poo puppy Oliver loves them.
4;Rich, Creamy, Sweet...;This is not too bad with rich caramel flavor.  Wish the coffee is a bit stronger with this one.
1;One of the worst antiperspirants I've tried;I used to use Secret Clinical but I noticed it wasn't giving me the same results now that it used to.  I thought I would give Degree Clinical a try.
5;Healthful Tea;There were some issues with the initial order, but it has been resolved.  This product is important to my health and am glad to finally receive it.
5;Great price for a great product;Kernel Seasons products are terrific. They have both sweet and savory flavors, and Caramel is the best of the sweet flavors.
1;CHARMING WRAPPER BUT NO CANDY INSIDE;So far each pack opened has been missing product.  These are individually wrapped and the paper is there but the candy is missing.
5;Best pancakes I've had in long while!;Picked this up at the Milk Pail Market in Mt. View, Ca.
5;VIA decaf Italian;I love this stuff.  It is easy to use.
5;the best;jacobs Kronung Coffee is the only coffee we brew in our house, because it is the best.  If you try it, you will not regret.
5;Uncle Lee's Legends of China Green Tea;I am completely satisfied with Legends of China Green Tea purchase from Amazon.  The tea arrived in a timely manner accoording to my shipping choice.
5;Mushy, no way!;Best brown rice pasta that I ever tasted! It's not mushy at all as you may concern it may be when it comes to rice pasta. Flavor, taste, texture, and pretty much everything, I prefer this pasta over regular pasta! I don't have any problem with wheat or anything, but I keep buying this pasta after I tried once.
3;Chocolately -- but too sweet . . .;Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.
5;Good brand of Coconut Oil;We have tried a couple of brands and have found this one to be one of the best.  This is the one we use in our household.
5;best chocolates available;These country-specific Cachet chocolates are, in my opinion, the best available anywhere. Costa Rica and Uganda tie, for me, as the best darks.
5;Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Food;Bless Paul Newman's heart. His services to the Feline Community are immeasurable.
5;Yummy & Authentic;I was very apprehensive to purchase this product. In the past I found that all the rice based Ready to Eat Indian food (several brands) had either strange aftertastes and/or didn't taste the way they were supposed to.
5;No complaints;Cant beat it for the price.  Will buy again.
5;Great Tasting - Tested for Mecury & Omega 3's - Read the Labels & Research Yourself;I've been using this tuna for many months, buying it here on Amazon, and it has always been excellent! I've given away a few cans to friends and co-workers without mentioning anything, and all of them have came back and asked me for more info about it. It is simply the best tuna I've ever had by far!<br /><br />Read the labels and research yourself where your tuna is coming from, and how it is processed.
4;Nice hot chocolate;Good price with a nice variety to choose from.  It's comparable to the more expensive kcups on amazon.
5;Some of their favorite treats;These treats have more nutritional value than others I have seen.  No guilt about giving them to my kitties and they love them.
5;Easily the best low cal no sugar mix I've had;I was looking for something without sugar/carbs as far as a mix and I finally found it.  Scales Margarita Mix is by far the best I've tasted.
1;I did not like it.;A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb.
5;Berry Good;This is the first time I purchased Goji Berries after reading all of the health benefits they have. The Navitas Naturals Brand through Amazon was the lowest priced I found on the web.
2;Starbuck Coffee Not sold as advertised;I have purchased this coffee from Starbucks store and it was great, however what I received from this purchase was not even in the same bag as shown and the coffee not nearly as fresh.<br />When I opened the new bag from Starbuck it was rich & oily and smelled very good, however the bag I purchased here the beans were very dry and the smell barely smelled like coffee.
5;Love this;We were looking for a replacement balsamic vinegar.  Previously, we had bought one from California which we loved, but shipping became prohibitive.
5;Excellent Product;I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.
4;Lily LIKED It!!;My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours.
3;Made in the US version, not the same recipe as Imported from Austrailia version;I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.
1;This company sells lousy tea!;Alvita  Nettle tea is lousy. It does not taste good.
5;Very popular in the office;I bought this for the office and everyone was very receptive and appreciative.  The 80 cups went FAST!  I would recommend this to anyone for its value and quality.
4;Fruit ropes -good snack;These are tasty, fun snacks. They are easy to take along in a backpack or bag, and are pretty healthful.
5;One of my favorite green teas;As a tea lover, I must say that this is one of my favorite teas of all time. Tazo does a wonderful job balancing out the hints of mint and lemon within this green tea blend.
5;Perfect for Giving Medications to Our Dogs;Every month, we give our three dogs (two Aussies and a Golden/Flat-Coat Retriever mix) pills for flea/tick/worm repellant.  In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.
2;Too Salty;I had a balance left on my gift card and saw that the jerky was on sale.  So I bought a couple of cases.
5;Best treat for catching contests....;These are the best treats ever for tossing and catching. My basset hound is a great catch at home, but tended to drop cookies and things when at houndie events.
5;Best gluten-free dairy-free chips;These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.
5;Great pasta even if not doing the glutten free diet;We found this pasta when my son had to do the glutten free diet. Now that he no longer needs to be on that diet, my entire family still enjoys this pasta and it is a staple at our home.
1;Looks bigger than actual size!;I received this as a gift.  Company enclosed a receipt in box so I know how much the sender spent - had to hunt to see who it was from.
5;I could drink it all day, if it was organic!;I love this tea. I just wish it was organic because I drink so much of it! I only drink it with a little milk and honey.
4;Inexpensive and works great;I bought these to be able to use my favorite coffess and lessen the expensive of the prefilled K-cups.  It little bit more time consuming than the prefilled cups, but if you make several at a time, they work great.
5;Mary;Red Tea Leaf's Espresso Matcha is amazing!<br /><br />This product has helped with the joint inflammation in my hands.  I was told I had arthritis and that it would probably get worse.
5;Love this product but not the price...;I love this gum! However, it is a bit pricey bought this way. I will continue to buy using cheaper options.
5;Discovered Wild Huckleberries;I bought huckleberry syrup on a trip and used it on ice cream, and that was it!  I loved the taste of this berry so much that I have forgotten about many of the other berries.  It is hard to find in stores and I was so glad to find this available on Amazon that I ordered a couple of them.
5;A Caution;My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.
5;Very tastey...and my cat agrees!;This is one of the best tasting nutritional yeasts products I've ever tasted and I've been using nutritional yeast for over 30 years.  I am vegan and use yeast for its cheesey, nutty flavor.
5;First ingredient: beef. And the dog loves it.;We've been trying out some cheaper options for dog food - the overly granola-y stuff from the upscale dog store was getting too expensive. I want something with a primary ingredient of meat, since, well, he's a dog, so I figured this would be a good option.
5;Maxwell House International Coffee;I have been drinking this coffee for over 25 years and still like it best.  I was dismayed to find it no longer sold in food stores I frequent.
1;Disapointed;I had great hopes for this sauce since it had the right things on the bottle.<br />Mario Batali,San Marzano tomatoes, fresh garlic and herbs.
5;Good mushrooms produced in USA;Canned mushrooms produced in the USA are hard to find these days (many are products of China).  Organic canned mushrooms can also be quite hard to find.
5;wild rice;this product is clean and is shipped in a very fast manner. it is absolutely delicious, even my four birds eat it cooked.
4;Received expired product;I was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes I received had already expired.  Luckily enough, the flavors had not yet degraded.
5;Exellent Organic Wheat Grass Seed;The seed is worth every penny.  Though not advertised as organic, it comes organic!  The seed grows great.
5;My sensitive Bichon loves this food. 2012 Update comment on Freshness;I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.
5;Quality Bargain;Very Good product. Made an excellent cup of tea, Strong and Tanic, reflecting it's Vit.
5;Excellent Taste;Twinings English Breakfast Decaffeinated Tea was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the English Breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version.
5;Addicting;I originally bought one regular cornuts pack and one Chili Picante to try. That did it.
4;I am not sure how to do reviews about water;"Like another review said, ""It's water.""<br /><br />Clear, refreshing, water."
5;Delivers what it promises;I don't really have much experience with dried morels.  I can only say that I was delivered exactly what I expected.
2;Weird after-taste for me (try one bag before you buy a box);I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags, because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers, but I really don't care for them at all (though other people to whom I've offered them  munch through them quite happily, and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer).  I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.
4;nice alternative to a larger bone;I give one of these to my golden retriever once or twice a week.  It's just the right size for her to enjoy it for an hour or so, but not so big that she overeats (she'll work at any rawhide until it's gone).
5;Good Stuff;This stuff is good!!  That's all I have to say.  Rich chocolate, sweet but not overpowering, with a taste of cinnamon and almonds.
5;quality comes at high price;quality food but the price is very high.  luv amazon's free ship over $25.
1;Made by gold!;This product is way too expensive.  I paid like more than $34.
5;Ahhhhh Dark Chocolate!;Love this dark chocolate. We could not find it in any store until just lately.
4;Awesome bones;My dogs beg for these treats every night after dinner.  I always make sure I have plenty of supply at hand.
5;Great with a nice olive oil;I bought this along with an oil & vinegar pour for a small Valentines Day present for my boyfriend. He is a great cook and likes to whip up a light appetizer to tide us over when dinner is cooking.
5;Shapes Doesn't Matter;The jelly beans were wonderful with different flavors.  Shapes not perfect did not affect the wonderful flavors.
5;Great product!;I have reordered these four more times now, I really like them.  They are kind of like pork rinds with a lot of flavor, and are healthier than regular chips.
5;Taylors of Harrogate Assam Tea;I was first introduced to this tea at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  I loved it and wrote down the name and looked for it on Amazon.
5;Great Buy;What a buy!!! With the price of these nuts in the store this is an unbelievable price.  I was happy to find the nuts were fresh, good color, great taste!!  Buy the bulk and keep in the freezer.
5;veghead421;These bars are very flavorful and taste great.  i am really inpressed with these bars.
5;Not too spicy;
1;Dish soap for sale.;I don't know why anyone would choose to drink this soap-like concoction, which claims to be made out of pure coconut water. Trust me, nothing in this box tastes even remotely like a coconut, water or anything vaguely natural.
5;great deal.;Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.
1;Awful -10;These are without a doubt the worst Mac & Cheese I have ever had.  I am on a Gluten Free Diet and while most gluten free are not as good as regular food items there are awful.
5;My husband loved it!;I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it was a big hit with him and our children..
5;Amazed;I feed my ancient, grumpy cat a joint suppliment that he just barely tolerates the taste of but is excellent in increasing his arthritic mobility. The suppliment comes in a large capsule.
3;Moisturizes without weighing down;"This a an effective moisturizer that left my natural African-American hair moisturized with a light scent without being uneven or leaving my hair feeling ""tacky"".  The scent is a light non-floral scent that I associate with shea butter or a light almost coconut scent."
5;Darn these are Good!!!!!;Two of my favorite things is cheese & garlic, & to find them together in the same mix made me very happy. They have great flavor & are so easy to make.
1;Some broken jars;When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs.
5;Sumatran;I love Sumatran beans and Green Mountain puts out a good product. Good flavor and very bold.
5;Whoa! That's Sweet!;When they said one drop was equal to a whole packet of splenda, I didn't believe it, until I tried it. Turns out it's super sweet with very little aftertaste.
5;Fantastic cup of coffee!;"This is my favorite of all the CBTL regular coffee capsules! It is a nice dark roast with a very smooth finish. I have a <a href=""http://www."
5;By far my favorite k cup;Green mountain got it right this time! This is one of my favorite k cup flavors and the aroma is amazing. Just like dunkin donuts pumpkin spice coffee but way cheaper to brew at home.
5;Delicious gluten & dairy free bars;These bars are delicious and both gluten & dairy free. The price is a lot cheaper on Amazon, most stores charge close to $2 a bar.
5;quick and Good;excellent, tasty product. Nutricious and nicely packaged.
1;Bad change in taste;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;If you like cloves, you'll love this gum!;I love love love this gum!  I used to find it at World Market, but they have stopped selling it.  It was $1 per pack, so this is a little better deal at 20 packs for less than $18, but not by much.
4;Reasonably Delicious;This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water.
5;Very nice flavor;I really like the flavor.  Its not to light or too strong.
1;APPALLING price -- greedy;I love this tea. I am disgusted by the appalling mark-up this seller has put on it.
5;Absolutely Great!;This is by far my favorite hot sauce to use on just about everything! The key to using this sauce is MODERATION! If you use too much you will be begging for mercy. But when you get it right, it puts just the right amount of heat to get your scalp tingling but not so bad that it takes away from the taste of what your cooking.
5;Cafe Delicato;I was first introduced to Illy in Paris. My friend used it in a drip coffee maker and I couldn't believe how smooth it was, whether the scoop as level or heaping.
1;cats couldn't eat it;I don't know what was wrong with this food, but my cats couldn't eat it.  When they tried they would start chewing and it would fall out of their mouths.
5;Great Taste;Pilao is my favorite coffe. I have tried several brands from around the globe but so far this is the best tasting.
5;A very hard to please little Poodle;I have a little toy Poodle and she is very hard to please when it comes to her food. I tried just about every brand of dog food I could find and she would not touch any of it.
5;Honey Crunch Wheatgerm;I have a recipe for home made crackers that calls for wheat germ.  The Kretschmer Honey Crunch Wheatgerm is a wonderful wheat germ for this recipe.
2;Not so great;I expect a more robust flavor from a Colombian coffee. The Caribou K cup has an OK flavor
1;Not The Item I Ordered;While I'm sure the coffee I received is a good coffee, it is NOT what I ordered.  I ordered Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, but received Robust Bold.
5;Chronic ear infections or skin problems?  No more with Halo!;We adopted a sweet dog from a local animal rescue. His underbelly was red, inflamed looking, and he was constantly scratching.
5;Jack Link's;Years ago this jerky was King B Jerky and was the best Jerky in the world.  Even with the name change, the company, Jack Link's is still the best flavored jerky.
4;Great product, shipping took a while;It was a great deal because this stuff is twice as much in the grocery store. The shipping took much longer than expected and that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
5;Amazing stuff!;This is the only ginseng tea that actually makes me feel better.  Wonderful for energy levels, arthritis pain, and stress relief.
4;handle gingerly.....;Wonderful product.<br /><br />Bag tends to tear lengthwise easily during the usual dispensing procedure.
5;California Lifestyle Flax Soy Bread;I bought mine at Sprouts farmer's market in Orange today.<br />it was really good.
4;Good stuff;
5;Love Green Mountain;The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee is really my favorite K-cup coffee. Not to bold and not wimpy either.
4;Hard to Find;We could not find this product in our local stores, (We tried six different stores including 2 super market chains, 3 walmarts, and 2 pet stores.) so we had to order it here.
5;Makes a Nice, Rich Cup of Coffee;Some reviewers say you can't teabag these pods, because the coffee will be week. However, if you put the pod in a cup, pour boiling water over it, then set a spoon on top of the pod, so it doesn't float to the top, leave it in the cup for about twenty seconds or so, then use two spoons and gently squeeze the pod over the coffee cup, voila, you get a nice, rich cup of coffee.
5;Really spicy;These noodles are great really spicy but not overpowering for me. I usually add some vegetable like peas and carrot.
5;Great high value treat!;My dog does unbelievable things for a Buddy Biscuit! They're soft, easy to eat (no grazing for crumbs), easy to break into tiny pieces (don't want your dog to get fat because of training!), and reasonably priced. I couldn't be happier with them.
5;Great tasting product;Great tasting product. Doesn't really have a 'foam' on the top, but the flavor is excellent.
1;Juniper disappointment;Looked nothing like the picture.  very very small, not much green.
5;Addictive little mints;I used to love Altoids cinnimon mints. But I bought these in Whole Foods once<br />and the flavor was REAL.
1;completely ripped off;after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross.
3;When is rice not rice;Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles.
5;Good morning coffee;Great coffee to start your day. We are repeat customers and the 50 count box meets our needs to reduce waste.
5;Kasho GoLean - love it;We love this cereal - and the Berry flavor as well.  My husband and I eat it all the time.
5;Best peach tea, ever!;I have tried so many peach teas that were either bitter, pale, or off tasting.  This is hands-down my favorite peach tea.
5;best on the grocery shelf chai;I've enjoyed this chai for over six years now and still can't wait to wake up in the morning to a cup (my reason to jump out of bed). The company recently discontinued the spicy mix (orange box), but they would like to hear your comments
5;new zico bottles are FANTASTIC!;Thank you ZICO! i love the new bottles. I was a huge fan of the tetra packs but i couldnt take em anywhere.
5;Use this instead of sugar.. PLEASE!;"Here is the jist:  Sugar = Toxic Xylitol = Healing<br /><br />I'm not kidding. It sweetens just like sugar, feels just like sugar though a bit ""lighter"" in consistency."
5;A great-tasting cup of coffee every morning!;We have owned our Keurig since before Christmas, and have sampled many of the k-cups through the 5-cup sampler packs.  After all of the tasting the Timothy's Italian is my favorite blend.
5;Tasty crackers;My kids really like these.  I suppose they are very similar in taste to Goldfish, but these are healthier, which I like.
5;Great gluten free product!;This is a great product for people who must eat on a gluten free diet.  It mixes up easily and makes nice pancakes of a familiar consistency.
5;Amazing;Amazing chips..
5;Gorgeous!;This subtly flavored, sweet-but-not-too-sweet dessert makes the most extraordinary fruit salad.  Just cook and set it as the instructions suggest, then toss it with tidbits of brightly colored fruit that harmonizes nicely with almond.
3;gotta love garlic;this product tastes real good if used in small amounts.  i put it on salads, potatoes, spaghetti etc.
4;yum;Omaha Steaks collections make a great gift. Especially the non-steak samplers.
1;Disgusting;These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.
1;Received...;Arrived by given deadline and in good condition, but sorry to me they taste like dried throw-up wrapped in salmon. My mom likes it though.
1;DANGEROUS!  Half of the cans were dented and top popping up.;When I received my box of cans, almost half were dented and the tops rounded up indicating that there was bacteria causing pressure.  I would not buy this product again.
4;Good for In A Hurry meal;Have only used a couple of packages but they did the job when there were last minute meals to get on the table.<br />If I had more time I probably would have added a little of this or that to make it even more of a complete meal.
5;Great;These sardines taste great. Very tender meat, no bones, not too much salt.
1;Nothing like Big Easy Bold;Apparently alot of folks like this product, but I have to say..
5;Taste Like Sugar;It taste like sugar. it taste great.
5;Awesome!!!!;The Shirataki Noodles were awesome!!!!  My sister and I purchased 20 bags and they are almost gone, we cook them everyday!!!  Yes, they do have a funny odor when you first open the bag, DUMP THEM IN A STRAINER AND RUN COLD WATER OVER THEM FOR A MINUTE AND THEN BOIL THEM FOR LIKE 5 MINS!!!!  They are totally great!!!  I have made them with spaghetti sauce, stirfried (after being boiled) with veggies and shrimp.  Stirfried with veggies and parm cheese, just some teriyaki sauce and grilled chicken in a skillet!!!!  I can go on and on.
5;Pill Pockets Help Reluctant Pill Takers;We first encountered these at a vet's office and tried them, but recently I have been buying via Amazon for convenience and price. The capsule ones help get various pills, including fish oil, into our two dogs.
5;YUMMY;I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr old son who has allergies to Peanuts/treenuts..
2;Mostly Just Sauce;The variety pack has two flavors and styles of cat food. Chicken Pot Pie:  be careful when you open the can because it is mostly filled with liquid that could easily spill out.
5;Awesome PB;I love this product!!! It really is great. I tastes amazing in my protein smoothies I make after my workouts.
5;Favorite Decaf!;After giving up caffiene it was tough to find a coffee I really loved again. I wanted to avoid the chemicals of other decaf processes.
5;Great Stuff;Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is by far the best gluten free product I have ever used. I recommend it to anyone, even those that do not need gluten free products.
4;A little bitter;Not bad but a little too bitter for our taste. Enjoy Coffee People extra Bold better.
5;Naturally Good vs Good Naturally!;"We were delighted to find that we could purchase this particular brand of rice online because our local store had discontinued selling it. We told the store that they needed to start selling it again but for some ""stupid"" reason they haven't."
4;Treat it as the best tasting cough drop out there;I have been on something of honey jag this year.  It seems to find it's way into everything around me from baked goods to bath products.
5;Love this stuff;We have been using this pancake mix for about 3 years now and it's no longer available at our local stores.  Amazon to the rescue!  When I make the pancakes I add a little protein powder and water, that's it!  They are delicious and a traditional Sunday meal at our house.
5;My favorite, but updated;This is my favorite k-cup - it's strong yet smooth. My backup flavor is Emeril's Big Easy Bold, which is stronger.
4;Mango Pineapple Honey Green Tea;I usually drink Crystal Light and my favorites tend to be the simple flavors. This was neither and that was good.
5;YUMMMY!!!;I tried this cereal with coconut milk and it taste wonderful. It adds just enough sweetness without ruining the whole idea of being healthy.
5;By far the BEST;This is by far the best hot fudge chocolate I have ever had.  Will be ordering more as the two jars I ordered are almost gone.
4;Kid-tested, Mom-approved;My 13-year-old daughter has decided that she likes granola. She's been happy to help me finish off this bag, and it's a good a snack as any for her.
5;Yummy doggy dots;I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to.
5;Really Good;I had received one of these in my Conscience box this month.  I loved it so much so I wanted to try the other varieties as well.
4;Good quinoa, but not pre-washed;This is a tasty red quinoa, but I didn't read the description close enough to note that this quinoa is not pre-washed.  The directions on the package state to wash in cold water several times before cooking.
4;Terrible time opening the can;This is the second time I have ordered a gallon of extra virgin olive oil thru Amazon. The big problem was opening the spout.
5;Yummy!;This flavor is one of my favorite K-cups. When I drink it everyone wants to know who has the great smelling coffee and it taste as good as it smells.
4;Yummy -- but not what I was expecting;This is a delicious drink, but it is not the refreshing beverage you would expect. The chocolate formulation has added sugar and coconut cream, so it tastes like a dairy-free version of chocolate milk.
5;Perfect for the turn......;I love these little power boosts for the turn. I always suffer getting out of the grove at the turn if I have to go in and order food ect.
4;Not quite the best...;In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group
5;Tiny and Tasty Cinnamon Squares of Wheat;Cinnamon roll is a welcome addition to the lineup of available flavors. Kellogg's does a nice job to replicate cinnamon roll taste in this delicious cereal.
4;mocha K cups;Must like it since I am a repeat buyer! Just wish more choc zing. mmmm.
2;barely any vanilla aroma or flavor;"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing."
5;tasty;At 80 cents a piece these are a good deal. They contain all natural ingredients which sounds like something for a tree hugger which I'm not
4;Not preservative-free;These bars do taste great without being too sweet. A much healthier alternative than candy bars or the bars with added processed protein, but they are not 100% natural.
5;Delicious!;I just ordered another 50 packets - this stuff is one of the best inventions out there! I stayed away from the Via when it first came out because I'd never had an instant coffee that wasnt nasty. But when Starbucks ran a big promotion I decided to give it a try and I'm SO glad I did.
5;Good food for English bulldog;We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it.
5;Another good recipe from Progresso;Until my wife and I started a weight loss effort earlier this summer, we hadn't eaten all that much Progresso soup. Because of their variety of flavors and low calories, we decided to give them a try, and I'm very glad we did.
3;A bit of a mild taste;This is a very mild tasting tea. I was sort of expecting it to hit my taste buds and BAM
5;Great Vanilla Flavor;I don't go to Starbucks often, but when I do I usually get the Vanilla Latte.  While this isn't creamy like a latte, it does have a similar vanilla flavor (an great aroma too).
3;One Bottle Won't Do Much;Essentia bottle water taste like most bottled water.  It did not have an after taste or weird finish.
3;Expensive, but it worked!;I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.
5;Five Star, Awesome Oil!;Great & Healthy Oil. Try it out for yourself.
1;Every box had 100 cookies...;I mean cookie pieces very embarrassing gifts. I will not being buying from this product line EVER again.
5;An Excellent Food;Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run.
2;Very Weak Tea;The flavor is okay when using two tea bags.  It is insipid with just one tea bag.
5;Good product, good price;Good for Japanese cooking (dashi), and my cat loves it.  Good price compared with other dried bonito flake sources I've tried.
5;Excellent;Cytomax is the perfect recovery drink.  It mixes easily and tastes great.
5;YUM! NOMS!;Im actlly eating the banana nut bread bars right now. They are so delicious i buy a box every week at my trips to the grocery store.
2;Noodles are all Water!;"I was excited to get these noodles, as I am on a low carb diet, but was sadly disappointed when I opened the package, to find that the supposedly 8 oz. of ""product"" was actually half water, with half noodles."
4;Tastes good;I have no idea if this really works, but it tastes good and makes sure I am drinking fluids.  I was told that I would need to drink 12 cups of this a day to help promote milk production.
1;Now made in China.;And they are DRASTICALLY lower in quality.  Do a brief search on the equivalent of the USDA or Dept of Animal Welfare in China.
5;Worth trying;I am personally trying to eat gluten free. I purchased this product in hopes that I could still eat things like Macaroni and cheese, as long as I could find a suitable alternative for my wheat pasta.
5;Pumpkin Bread;This pumpkin bread was the most favorite of all the tasty treats sent to my son during his time in a military academy.  All his friends would line up to get in his room on the weeks this bread was sent.
5;I wanna kiss the person who invented these!;My 14 month old can feed these to herself.  I throw them in my purse and always have a healthy snack for her.
5;Works with everything;This seasoning is the best thing out there. I cook a lot of food  for a lot of picky people and things they claim they don't like, they eat when i put this seasoning on it.
5;Excellent flavor flav!;As the picture depicts these are not your traditional K-cups however like others have stated it is not a problem. They pop right in your machine.
5;I love, love, love, coffee!!!;I love coffee anytime of day. But sensibly I drink decaffienated coffee during afternoon and evening hours.
5;Healthier Choice;This is the only chocolate syrup product I can find on the shelf at my local grocery store that contains NO SOY and NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. I like how it tastes and how it mixes easily with milk.
1;did not like at all;our family did not leke thast at all. Din not atst lke figs.
5;great!;My dog loves this food, and it lives up to all the others comments and high ratings.  Our vet gave us a list of foods that are highly recommended based on nutritional value and this was one of them.
5;Yum!;"This is a great and delicious way to eat Thia food at home.  Just ""melt"" the entire packet (if you like it spicy) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan."
5;These are yummy;Health Warrior Chia Bars Acai Berry.  I purchased these as a late afternoon healthy snack.
5;Great for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs;I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.
5;Better than Ener-G bread;If you are gluten free, the search for bread and pizza, and maybe bagels, is a real quest.<br /><br />After eating Ener-G for a couple of years, I tried Udi's at my local Trader Joes.
5;Wonderful dog treats;"Our two boxers love these bones. They are ""aggressive chewers"" and we have had the same two Nylabones for over a year."
5;Great Product, Great Service;First, as usual, the product arrived as described, on time.  No complaints at all from this reviewer.
5;Quite tasty and a bit different.;I dont know about its popularity in South America outside of a little I've read online, but i do know it isnt widely known in the U.S.
2;Serious health food;If you're out for sheer health benefits without taste and without desirable texture, this one's for you.  I did not expect much out of it except health benefits, so I wasn't surprised.
5;Torani is the best for my coffee;"I buy Torani on Amazon ever since I moved to the ""middle of nowhere"" and cannot purchase it here.  This is a great value with free shipping."
5;great coffee;This is great coffee, everyone in the family enjoyed it very much. The pods are very well made, the brew is medium, it's smooth and well balanced.
5;Very nice basket;I was concerned ordering a gift basket on-line due to some less than favorable feedback on other baskets and vendors.  This one was very nicely done, and well worth the price.
5;Happy to find on Amazon;I was very happy to find Snyder's unsalted pretzels on Amazon, they can be difficult to find in groceries.  Great price and great delivery.
4;Delicious, yet too high in sugar;This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there.  It tastes like skinny chocolate milk.
5;WOW! GOOD STUFF! Very tasty but not overly tasty;I ordered this not to long ago just out of curiosity and WOW, I'm surprised by the taste and quality in this product. Normally things that claim they are 100% natural have something in there to make it sweeter than it should be.
4;Seriously good soda! The best.;This soda will knock you out it's so good!  I bought one at a specialty shop and had to go back just for another soda! I realized later that the caffeine content is pretty high.  Since then I have sworn off caffeinated cola and if they made a caffeine free version I would give it 5 stars.
1;Horrible packing job;The package of sugar containers was wrapped in plastic, and most of the containers were broken, so sugar was spilled everywhere in the box because not only were the sugar containers broken, but the plastic wrap too! So I opened a box of sugar basically. Horrible packing job.
4;Great Angel Hair option for GF pasta;"We were happy to find an ""angel hair"" version of GF pasta as my husband prefers this style to ""spaghetti"".  Although a box of this is comparable in price to a box of spaghetti, I do find I need to make more - our family of 4 will finish off close to 2 boxes in one meal."
5;This is the BEST olive oil!;This is a superb product!  Excellent service and packaged with care.  I used to purchase this high quality olive oil at the Farmer's Market in San Francisco but have recently relocated to the East Coast so I now must have it shipped to me.
4;Good flavor;I have this on hand mainly for guests who drink decaf.  Sometimes I'll have a cup of this decaf when I feel like having coffee at night.
5;Excellent product!;Best dog food out there!  Good ingredients and my dog loves it.  We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
5;My daughter loves it!;Based on my daughter's opinion, I am giving this tea 5 stars.  She asked me to buy her this as a Christmas gift.
5;Yummy!;A wonderful, delicious, AFFORDABLE way to bring truffles into your life..
5;Duncan Hines Does It Best;If not making a cake from scratch..
5;Best Price you will ever find;We all know Jack Link's is an excellent product. Dates were excellent and you will never find a better price anywhere so go ahead sign up for autoship and enjoy healthy protein anytime.
5;Pricey - yes. Worth it? Definitely.;My dogs are usually fed raw, but it was getting hard to find alternative meat sources for my highly allergic Lab-X. I ordered this and the venison after a holistic vet tech recommended it, and it is AMAZING.
5;Best kept secret;Love Muddy Buddys, just need to know where I can buy them besides Sam's Club, of which I'm not a member.  Been to 3 different grocery stores, a Walgreens and CVS, no one knows what I'm asking for.
5;Exudes Quality;A quality product, served warm with thick whisky/Drambuie cream, it just doesn't get better than this for a mince pie.<br />I purchased a pack and quickly realised that more would be necessary - alas they were sold out and had to wait for them to become available again
2;not what I'd hoped;It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture..
5;DEEELISH!;I used to buy these all the time back home as a good on the go snack cycling or whenever. After I moved I couldn't find them anywhere.
3;Both my dogs refuse to eat these.;Normally, I wouldn't post a review against a product like this that is much healthier than the average dog treat, but since all of the other reviewers have said their dogs love these treats, I thought I'd mention that both of my dogs refused to eat these. I agree with others that they are low calorie and small, so they're better than a lot of other dog snacks, especially if you plan to give multiple treats out.
5;Plocky's Rice and Beans Tortilla Chips;I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.
5;Great coffee!;"When reading the other reviews, I was hesitant to get it, but I am glad I did!  The smell from opening one of the mini bags in the box was amazing, definitely proving it to be a ""French Roast.""  The taste isn't as strong as other French Roast coffees, but that's fine with me."
5;Arrived as described;I ordered these K-Cups with points from my credit card.  They arrived as described, but without much packaging - - they were just sitting loose in the box, which works for me.
3;Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.;"I have noooo idea what the ""blech"" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad."
5;Arrowroot Powder;Previously I had only been able to find this is 1 or 2 oz. packages & had little packets taking up space until they were used.
1;pic is wrong;pic shows grinder, but this is oil, and is not organic. Don't buy based on pic, but on descrption.
5;Great Diabetic Friendly Sweetner! Highly Recommended!;"""Splenda"" is one of my favorite things ever! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for sweet tasting snacks and drinks that will not effect my blood sugar levels. Splenda makes it possible for us to have sweet baked goods, sweet ice tea and coffee again since I don't like ""Nutra-Sweet"" or ""Sweet and Low""<br /><br />Like most diet products it is not perfect and Splenda does not taste quite as good as regular sugar, but it is as close as we have found."
5;Caribou Coffee Blend K-Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers;Caribou Coffee Blend is our family's favorite K-Cup flavor. It's strong and smooth in the extra bold package so you can make a max-size cup without it tasting weak.
5;Wonderful Olives!;"I love, love, love olives in general, but am often disappointed in ""marinated"" olives because they are either very oily/greasy, or the herbs are bitter or unpleasantly ""twiggy"".  These olives are none of the bad things, and all of the good things -- salty, tasty, bursting with flavor."
5;Simply perfect!;Childhood nostagia all over again! I LOVE peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I don't often make them because they're rather messy. These bars solve that problem-- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that's in the bar.
4;Not By The Box;I really enjoyed eating this macadamia delights from Meiji. The chocolate has a great, and not too sweet, taste.
5;Love it!;I bought these along with Cat Crazies. Our cats love them both! I bought these knowing the cats love milk tabs.
5;NOM NOM NOM NOM......;really, that's all i have to say! The chips can be a little..
4;Tasty Grape;This is a good sodastream flavor and tough to find locally. I've found a little less than the measured amount makes a better mix.
4;Very tasty!;I like this product because it basically does what I anticipated. As long as you have a full glass of water with it it will keep you feeling full for a few hours.
2;coffee;I love green mountain coffee and most flavored coffees.  This one is a little weak for my taste.
4;Quality yeast;I've been using it for a couple of months to make homemade bread and it has worked great. Have kept it in an airtight container in the freezer and has continued to work as advertised.
4;Good Taste but Expensive;I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.
5;Convienent for quick sanwiches;I'm the only one in my family who LOVES SPAM.<br />So it's wastefull to open a whole can just to make a quick sandwich or two for myself.
1;Absolutely No Smell No Taste;Not even sure if this is really Dill Weed????? These look like crushed mint leaves or just plain crushed leaves, dill weed looks feathery and the smell and taste is VERY distinct. This item is NOT.
5;Wonderful fruity taste;This fruity herbal tea, made by combining hibiscus flowers and rosehips with dried pieces of berries, has a naturally sweet, rich taste and an enticingly delicious smell. No sugar or honey is needed unless you prefer extra sweetness.
4;Roy C from Columbia, CT;They are everything I expected except for one flaw. I had trouble keeping the lever completely down on the machine.
3;Plain Old Cereal;I bought this cereal thinking I was buying an amazing product for my child..
5;Competitive price and good quality;I have a 12 year old siamese mix who's diabetic. Being able to buy this food online has saved me a little bit of $$$ in vet appointments to get the product.
4;Great if you have B-6 Toxicity;When I found out I was suffering from vitamin B-6 toxicity, this was the only cereal brand I could find that was not fortified with the B vitamins. Now I only wish I could find a multi-vitamin that didn't have vitamin B-6.
5;Excellent plants;We bought these venus fly traps for use in a science fair project. We knew nothing about caring for them when we ordered.
5;great snack;I love these. They're great for a quick snack and you can just have a couple if you don't want a lot, since they're so small.
4;If you like it.;This product was purchased as a gift.  It delivered in excellent condition and I am sure that it was of excellent quality.
1;Good quality, too expensive;I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each - $16.24 with tax, this brand in one 16-ounce pouch $14.
5;Outstanding;This is one of the best mustards I have ever tasted. Found this in 2003 and have been ordering it online ever since.
1;Greenies Made My Dog SICK;Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market.
5;I ate 2 cups of Grape-nuts today;I ate 2 cups of Grape-nuts this morning, on a bet that i couldnt, while wearing a St. Patricks day hat and fake beard.
5;Crack for Dogs;"Like others on here, I got my first bag of Lean Treats for our Shih Tzu, at the veterinarian and he loved them. He knows them as his ""treats."
5;Some Corrections;For those saying it doesn't pass the taste test..
5;The best, hands down!;My mother is on a strict gluten free diet and I'm usually not a fan of the foods but when she made these cookies I couldn't even tell they were gluten free.  I actually liked them better than regular cookies with gluten.
5;a hidden treasure!;I'd had a box of this sitting in my pantry for two years, and I finally tried it last week.  I now refer to it as my 'lazy woman's risotto'.
5;High-quality, convenient K-cup storage;High-quality and convenient, this drawer is even nicer than I expected.  Sturdy, no wobbling.
1;TOTAL RIP OFF!  DON'T BUY HERE!!;No where did it say how many ounces were in these 7 bags, so I assumed it was the larger bag that Sam's Club sold.  Sam's Club also sold the larger bags for about $2.
5;SWISS MISS K CUP COCOA;This product speakes for itself,try it it is very good, and tastes great. I only had one k-cup that was bad there was nothing in the cup, so it probaly happened at the manufactures, when they made it.
5;Great flavor without the Alcohol;Many recipes have Alcoholic beverages used in them. Not all of them cook off the alcohol and I have to make mine (PG) for kids plus I don't drink.
4;Suffering from excessive consumption of these?;If you want to avoid visiting the porcelain throne after eating these, follow a couple of simple rules:<br /><br />- Don't consume these on an empty stomach - have them after you have eaten something first.  An after meal dessert is perfect for these candies, as are any candies containing maltitol.
4;Some Flavors are Good, Others are Great;I really, really love Pop Chips. They are much lower in fat and calories than regular potato chips, plus the texture flavor is much more enticing.
4;Very Good Conditioner;I'm picky about conditioners and usually only use Pantene.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at this product's ability to make my hair shiny and manageable.
5;Good, but eat it quick;"I really like this popcorn, so I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />However, the product Amazon is shipping is only a few months away from the ""Best By"" date code."
5;Oh, WOW!!;I've been using Bob's Red Mill Fava Beans but was looking for a less expensive alternative when I stumbled onto this product. It's so much better.
5;A winner with my cats and my puppy;They all gather around when I reach for this bag. They make great training treats, as my puppy regards them as a high value reward.
5;Very Convincing Meat Replacement;I ate beef jerky every single day at my school cafeteria when I was growing up. I loved the stuff.
5;My Favorite!;I love these payday bars. I carry one with me to work eveeryday.
2;not the best;i really loved the picture and the items but when i got em i was deffently shocked it is not worth the price maybe $20-$25 bucks at the most.the box paper was comming off when i got it a piece was ripped and the box was half filled with red paper so you got the same amount of paper and candy lol the goods inside wernt very impressive either they were like dollar candy couldnt been more then 10 bucks at the most.
4;syrup;I have tried more amber(darker) syrup before and have found that I like this milder flavor more.  Great product will purchase again.
1;Not sweet and too dry??;Sounds weird to say, but you have to try them to understand.  They are not sweet like fresh pineapple.
5;Best healthy dog food ever!!!!;My yorkie has severe alergies. He tears alot and is constantly scratching.
4;coffee to wake the dead;Double Black Diamond is a strong cop of joe. I'm not a morning person, but this DBD coffee gets me going at 5:30 AM.
2;Definitely not for me...;I have enjoyed the KIND bars, but these Almond Cashew ones are definitely not for me.  Much more dense and gooey that the other varieties that I have had, they did have a good crunch.
5;Healthy breakfast choice;I was so happy that this type of cheerios was available once again thru subscribe & save.  I got these once before and they went off the list.
3;Calorie fat free peanut spread;Slight peanuty taste. Does not taste at all like authentic peanut butter but when used with sugar free jelly suffices your craving for peanut butter taste with no calories especially if you are on a diet.
5;Ate half the bag in only one day...and I'd do it again!!;I was craving caramel popcorn lately for some reason, and was lucky enough to come across this flavor purely by accident. To sum up - probably the BEST I've ever tasted! It is sweet but not too sweet, with a little salty undertone from the butter (a perfect balance, at least for me)
5;FANTASTIC!;I agree with the other reviewer. This is the best popcorn ever.
5;Special Marzipan;Delicious Marzipan. Niederegger makes the best marzipan.
5;Just as good as the original;These sugar free Haribo gummi bears are nearly identical to the original.  I'm a huge Haribo fan trying to cut back on the sugar intake.
5;Delicious granola.;The eat,think,smile granola clusters cranberry walnut is absolutely delicious.It is a bit hard but I crumble it up in my vanilla yogurt and ave an out standing breakfast or anytime snack.
4;Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?;I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.
3;Yummy but expensive;These are yummy, healthy little treats for my kids but I won't be buying them again due to the price. I can find them at Target for cheaper and without shipping and handling.
2;"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery";"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive."
4;Nothing that good lasts for ever.;My daughter's 1 year old blue nose pit, Dex, loves these Everlasting Treats. But I wish they would last longer.
3;Varying results for teens;My three teens (110lb - 125lb) loved the effect of this the first time they tried it (at about 5pm in prep. for an evening swim meet).
1;not shipped as ordered;Yes I ordered 5 boxes of 24ct pecan turtles but,<br />what was shipped was 10 boxes of Pecan and Cashew turtles.<br />I E-mailed back asking why they substituted without my approval and their response was: our website clearly stated that the turtles were a combination of Pecan and Cashew turtles.
1;good concept, poor construction;The intention to create recyclable plastic is great, but the construction on these is unreliable. The bottoms fall out with regularity and since I use them for my indoor cat box, not good.
5;Love it!;Unlike most other hollandaise sauce packet preparations on the market, you don't need to add butter or milk or both to this.  This is just water, boil and it comes out perfectly silky every time.
5;Delicious and addictive!;These are the best snack food ever! Spicy AND healthy. The 100-calorie packs are a blessing 'cause I could gorge on them.
2;Watery and thin;I purchased two cases of Native Forest Coconut milk and received the Sir Lanka-sourced product.<br /><br />It is thin, with hardly any fat.
5;Great cookies--don't buy in the summer;These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging.
5;good product;good product for a celiac patient- good flavor, texture..
1;"Not ""All Natural""";"Read the packages carefully before buying.  Cadet is known for ""irradiating"" their products."
5;All four of my cats LOVE the BFF moist foods;My four kitty cats are in love with this food. I have been feeding it to them for about a week.
5;Delicious.  great shipping price from amazon;Excellent delivery time. Great product.
4;Excellent succulent dates;I needed to get my order up to $25 in order to get free shipping so I looked around for something I enjoy that wasn't too expensive. After reading the reviews I decided to try Bergin Nut Company Organic Medjool Dates.
4;Souxsie's food;My cat loves Newman's Own Organic Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats!  She had a picky eating problem and I simply could not find the right food that she would eat regularly.  After trying about 8 brands of cat food I finally landed on Newman's Own.
5;Creamy reduced carb delight;My husband and I have successfully dropped considerable weight by reducing our carb intake. The single thing I missed the most, however, was chocolate.
4;Tea for Me;This tea has a smooth, delicious and delicate flavor. This in conjunction with the health benefits of a green tea.
5;The best dog food!;After finding out my toy Shih Tzu was allergic to practically every dog food, I tried this. Not only is he not allergic to it, he loves it! He finishes every last morsel.
5;Hawaiian Red Sea Salt;Great sea salt!  You don't have to use very much, just a pinch to obtain great results & great taste.  Recommend highly, if you haven't tried it.
4;new favorite snack;I just picked up a tin of this at the minimart because I didn't want chips and I was feeling adventurous. This stuff is surprisingly delicious! I don't like canned sardines, but I love those snack-packages of smoked salmon when I can get them, (which is not often) and this tastes closer to the salmon.
5;Exceptional;I wasn't familiar with this coffee company, but was surprised to find that it makes an excellent product. The Creme Brulee flavor was just the taste I was hoping for, and it made many great pots of coffee.
5;Best Popcorn Ever;This popcorn is better than theater popcorn!  I have bought a couple of boxes from Target in town.  I pop it in the West Bend popper.
5;Best example of a blue cheese I've ever tried;And that is no exagerration!  Roaring 40's Blue is a wonderful mixture of strength and subtlety..
5;Mmmmmmmm...!;David Rio's Orca Spice Sugar-Free Chai is a wonderful treat..
5;Green Mountain Coffee K cups;These are fine fine K cups. I like the BIG box.
3;soda so-so;we loved the pomegranate 7-up flavor that was available temporarily last year, and hoped this one would be as good. It was not nearly as good, we were disappointed.
5;Zuke's Hip action treats;my dog loves them and I think they help her, even though we do have her on medicine for her hips. You can also break them in half if you don't want to give the full treat all the time.
5;SNYDERS OF HANOVER PRETZEL SNAPS, 10-OUNCE BAGS(PACK OF 12);A great tasting pretzel by Snyder's of Hanover of Pennsylvania and very easy between 2 people on a movie night finishing a bag throughout several hours. I got a couple of cases(Pack Of 12) shipped free to my home from Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.
5;Excellent chips!;Love these chips.  Good for a quick snack and I don't fee TOO guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips.
5;Not too sweet and dissolve well;I used a couple of Zym tablets for the first time.  I like them because they have a gentle taste - not too sweet with a pleasant lemon lime flavor.
4;Great concept - wish it was a bit more durable;My two little dogs absolutely LOVE the Everlasting Treats that fit into this ball.  This is a great concept, but the rubber is quite soft.
5;Superior Fruit Slices;These are terrific..
5;Convenient!;These baby corns have a nice texture with the taste that you would expect. Besides being used in traditional stir-friy, can be mixed with chopped onion and some salad dressing/mayo as a quick salad.
4;Good munch to crunch;KIND makes a good variety of these raw food bars. The Almond, Walnut, and Macadamia are very good and can be addictive.
2;Not what they claim to be;I bought these cakes at my local health food store. They look nothing like the images on the box in which they come.
5;2 pictures one product;You have 2 pictures of this item, one says no sodium the other with salt. I tried to order the salt version, had a reabait on the item.
5;Ok Food;I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it.
5;YUMMY!!;I love this product. I have it on auto-ship so I have some all the time.
1;icky;We love garden of eatin.  These are just icky.
5;Best Pretzels Ever!!;These are not sold in stores where I live, so I had to order them online.  They are the best pretzels ever, we eat them all the time.
5;Made in the USA;I recently got a new cat off of Craigslist. The previous owners had said that he was not a very picky eater.
4;Great syrup and free pump;I am grateful that this syrup came with a free pump. The syrup is great and tastes natural and not artificial.
5;just perfect;I just love the flavor of this tea. It has that exotic flair to it and the Mango taste is not overwhelming.
5;Excellent;This mix is slightly sweet and a very nice, smooth dark chocolate flavor. I will likely order more before the hot chocolate season ends.
5;They're a hit..;While they have been very well received, some people like the taste more than others.  (Not everyone has the same tastes.
5;Great Drink;My husband loves Bustello Cool Cafe con Leche! He previously drank Starbucks SF cold latte and prefers Bustello. It is only carried in a few stores not very close to our home.
5;Kelloggs Raisin Bran Crunch;The cereal is better tasting than the regular Raisin Bran.  I can have 1 cup of this cereal for breakfast and it satisfies me for a good 4 to 5 hours.
3;A good cookie but the orange taste is too strong;While Nana's makes generally excellent cookies, this particular formula is quite strange.  The orange zest flavor is incredibly strong and it has oddly crunchy rice-like bits in it that aren't great.
5;Now Foods Maple Syrup;Awesome product looks good and tastes great!  Good price, too.  Bought this one from Supplement Warehouse.
4;Totally fine!;I could not find any source for a variety of actual reviews for the Ariel wines anywhere (some from a few wine snob bloggers- what I did read was very, very negative) so I decided to go ahead and review it here. I was infinitely curious about it and finally broke down and paid the $6 to try it myself, anticipating that I might have to dump it.
5;Awesome.;My wife likes hummus and I didn't so I figered I would try to make it myself and if I needed to I could make it with a flaver that I liked. Didn't have to do alot of trying with these as the base.
5;Lab puppy loves it;My 4 month old lab has been on this for about 2 months and loves it.  I didn't want to feed her any chicken products, so I opted for the lamb.
1;~sugar free yes, low carb no~;I did a search for low carb foods and this was one of the items that popped up! Hooray! The carb content isn't listed but I figured that Amazon wouldn't lead me in the wrong direction. WRONG! I got my order and this is chalk full of carbs.
5;Black tea with mint;Most mint teas tend to be herbals- peppermint, spearmint, and the like.  What I like so much about this tea is that it combines mint with black tea.
5;great gift;I sent this to my friend's brother for his birthday while he is at school. He was so happy to get chocolate chip cookies sent to him at school for his birthday.
1;Where's the Lime?;Tastes like a poor Ranch fav almond. Barely any lime.
5;Great Spicy Snack - Highly Recommended;The Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are great tasting, with a strong smoky flavor and a nice jalapeno bite. These have a decent amount of spicy heat to them, but it isn't too overpowering.
5;Wonderful;The sevice was fast, and the product was fresh. I couldn't get this gum anywere local.
5;My cat loves this cat food;My cat loves this cat food so much that we feed it to her as treats. She has a tendency to get underweight so we feed it to her pretty much on demand (which is frequently).
5;Stevia - awesome sweetener!;My chiropractor recommended Stevia as an alternative to the artificial sweeteners I had been using.  I had been having chronic migraines, which he deduced were a result of my use of Aspartame.
3;I can't decide;I can't decide whether I like this or not. there is a pomogranate taste with lemon and something else i couldn't identify.
5;Great way to get protein;I have tried whey protein and found that it make me feel sick
4;Go away bad doggy breath!;My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.
5;My Cats Love prime filets meaty;I have four cats and they love the filets meaty selections.  It gives them something to chew that is wet food.
5;Pantry staple;I started ordering the turkey snack bites when searching for a no carb snack with a high protein ratio and these fit the bill.<br />Using subscribe and save I get a shipment once a month and pay under $3 a bag.
5;My Favorite Tea;This tea is absolutely wonderful. Every flavor in the assortment is delicious, I can't seem to pick one as a favorite.
5;Utterly marvelous -- best of the Sahale nut snacks;"These match the excellent quality of the same product from a local store, as do the ""Soledad"" almonds.  It is difficult to keep from eating the whole pricey bag at one sitting."
5;This is GRAT pasta sauce;"For most of my life I'd eaten two types of pasta ""sauce"": 1) My mom opened a can of tomato sauce, added a spice or two, poured it on the pasta and said, ""eat it - it's good,"" or 2) When I finally moved out I bought the cheap, store bought pasta sauce - Prego, Ragu, etc. I thought Prego was the best (far superior to the red tomato stuff I had at home), and that there wasn't anything else out there for me to try."
5;Did they change the recipe for these??? Rosemary and cherries?;I have ordered these just a few times for our new puppy and recieved exactly the picture shown (the chicken flavor) but I just re-ordered a new bag and thought I was getting exactly what I had ordered previously but this one is slightly differt.  They have added 'anti-oxidents' to the recipe so it has cherry, rosmary and some other things added.
1;Not my cup of tea;I received my order of Twinings Earl Grey K-Cups today and anxiously tried one tonight. Wow, I am disappointed to say the least.
1;Funny taste;"The flavor of the two does not taste lie strawberries and vanilla in my opinion. For being naturally flavored they do have a ""manufactured"" taste."
5;Happy dogs;I have 2 dogs that love these things.  Nice to get a large quanity, because buying them at the store individually can cost 2-3 times as much.
3;Not at all like the picture on the can!;What a great concept! It had a nice flavor and had good salt/pepper in it. I liked the onion flavor too.
5;Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!;I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.
4;Delicious!  But crumbly.;Compared to other graham crackers, this is much better than your generic brand, but also very crumbly.  It's not as moist, but doesn't dry your mouth, and the taste isn't too strong.
5;Low Cal and Delicious;My dog loves these treats and I love them because they are low calorie.  I was always worried when using other treats during training because I always felt as if I was giving him far too many calories.
5;First batch;Just finished my first batch of oatmeal in my crockpot.  Just tried some for breakfast and I found it to have a much fresher taste then the Mccains' steel cut oatmeal that I have made in the past.
5;great little tree;Its a very nice tree. Smaller then I thought but probably should have read to see the size before buying.
5;Great hot chocolate!!;I bought this multi pack to bring home to Europe in Christmas, and we are loving them all! We have good chocolate here but this is a lot of fun with the different flavors. The chocolate flavor is rich in all of them, and then they have a twist of the specific flavor that makes it really special.
1;Terrible. Worst Mustard Product EVER!;I grew up in Philly and NY and traveled extensively. Dined in so many excellent Chinese restaurants in every major U.
2;Misled;I was extremely happy to see that the sellers package was sent quickly and came the 2nd day of the estimated delivery interval they provided. I was unhappy with the product itself.
2;This was NOT Teavana tea. False Advertising.;This was not Teavana tea. This is false advertising.
5;Excellent corn syrup-free treat;My four-year-old loves fruit snacks, and when I started trying to cut corn syrup out of our diet, she was heartbroken that I wouldn't buy her the regular ones anymore. She's very finicky, and I was afraid she would balk at anything different, but she immediately loved these.
5;All around excellent!;"I am extremely happy with these fruit snacks.  My children love them and are a healthier alternative to other ""fruit"" snacks out there."
1;Contains methyl cellulose - not good!;It contains Methyl cellulose which is a non toxic relatively harmless chemical. However it is the main ingredient in KY jelly, fake semen on porn movies, glue and shampoo.
5;"""The"" way to give a cat a pill";After a week of struggling to get my older cat to take a pill twice a day, I tried these Pill Pockets and now the cat begs for his pills.  I divide it in half and give him one half without a pill, and then give him one with the pill.
3;Decent plant but not from Bonsai Boy, no free shipping;I ordered this from Amazon recently and it just arrived.  It was packed well and survived fine, however it's nowhere near as well trained as the one shown in the picture- it's more or less a ball of leaves and branches, less bushy than the photo.
5;Beautiful roses;These roses were so beautiful. They arrived on time, in perfect condition and lasted for almost a month.
5;The best in the U.S. market today.;"About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it (""they've been eating Wellness for years!""), and end up blaming it on the company."
5;Great Stuff!;I usually use Splenda packets, so this was a bit out of my comfort zone to try. The price and reviews seemed too good to pass.
5;Excellent low salt product;I keep my salt intake very low, and it is cheering to have a catchup I can use. This tastes great--it does have a salt substitute in it, but I'm OK with that, as I don't use any other source of salt substitute.
5;Best crunchy granola bar!;I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks.
5;Much Better than Newmans O!;For those of you who remember Hydrox, the battle continues - now in organic land.  Newman's chocolate creme sandwich is tasteless.
4;Taste of Thai Red Curry Noodles;These noodles are quick, covenient and very tasty. They're nicely spiced with more zing than most packaged foods, although if you're a big fan of hotness, you might want to add a touch of hot pepper sauce.
5;Best service, best price!;The Online Candy Store is just great. The shipping was fast and the gum was securely packaged.
5;The Best Tea!;I love Red Tea by Stash.  It is very difficult to find in my local supermarkets.
1;Lentil Soup - this is YUK!;Are you kidding? 4 stars, this is the worse soup I have bought on amazon, its rare that I write comments, but this deserved a low rating, the pasta in this soup comes across as dumplings, it can't be healthy for you. Try something else, Progresso has a much better flavor.
5;Chihuhua Chew;As always great product.  I have a 11yr old Chihuahua that loves them.
5;Great option for a quick meal!;I've been keeping this type of packaged food around for a couple of years as a quick and tasty meal option.  Before Sanskriti, I used to by Tasty Bites - but Sankriti is so much better! The food tastes fresh, not too oily (like Tasty Bites) and they don't skimp on the ingredients.
5;Powerbar gel;Great taste, I use it mainly for recovering energy when I ride mountainbike. It is easy to digest and 20 mg of caffeine makes me feel great on long rides.
4;Love it;I like a sweet tea and don't like licorice, still this tea is good for me.  I'm on day 4 of my seven day fast and whenever I have the urge to eat or am feeling low on energy I take this tea and voila- instantly I feel better (less hungry and more energized).
5;Good quality at a reasonable price;I love this tea. It's a high quality tea at a reasonable price.
5;Rating a noodle packet?  You betcha!;OK, so I never thought I'd be ordering groceries on Amazon, but this is the thing that got me.  When my local Asian grocery stopped carrying these noodles, I knew I had to find somewhere that did.
3;some good some bad;I love this coffee BUT the last box I got was some good some very bitter. I love this and have been buying for a long time but the last box was not as good.
5;very tasty;Having a peanut allergic son this stuff makes a great substitute.  texture wise it is exactly like peanut butter but with a slight cinnamon after taste quite pleasant.
3;Get the Splash of Pineapple instead!;Though refreshing, I much prefer O.N.
3;Just so-so;With the ingredients listed I thought it would be buttery soft on my lips but it's not.  Has little smell and a bit stiff.
5;My Favorite!!!;absolutely my favorite tea..
5;Zebra Bowtie Pasta;Purchased this pasta online after seeing it in a gift shop at a winery in Napa.  I was throwing a wedding shower for friend's of mine and knew this would be the perfect pasta since the bride's colors were black, white, and red.
5;Delicious, healthy!;I got these as an easy on-the-go snack.  My toddler loves them and will eat them non-stop if I let him!  I even sneak a few of them myself as they are incredibly tasty.
5;Best Price I could FInd;If you love chocolate but want something healthy, trying making a no-cook coconut oil dark chocolate fudge and adding a scoop of Sambazon.  It is wonderful! AND.
4;Very Good but could be Better;I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil.
4;Tasty salami just not as good as it used to be.;First of all, Otto's service was great. Order processing was quick and shipping was very prompt.
4;HImalayan Salt - 5 lb - Fine Ground;Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt!  I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts.  This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet, in moderation.
1;Worst Junk Food Ever;I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.
5;Crunch-a-tize me!;Not only is it a wonderful bowl of cereal to start the day, but its a great snack anytime of the day. I like to sprinkle it on my ice cream and it makes a great cheesecake pie crust too! I just love it with or without milk.
4;Works great for what it is.......;Got this for Christmas about a month ago
5;rich and delicious;I hadn't tried Caribou brand K-cups before and am extremely picky.  I like a rich, intense, well-bodied coffee and this product delivered.
5;Delicious!;I bought the mint chocolate and banana coconut to use in shakes.  They both were very delicious.
4;Would be best if Canola Oil was left out;Great ingredients although, chicken should have been 1st rather than chicken broth, the only thing I do not think belongs in it is Canola oil. Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them.
5;Healthy Kitten Food;I purchased this food on the recommendations of cat nutrition experts in the know. I read about Wellness foods online as being an excellent food for cats.
5;Very Convenient!;When my niece when off to college, I gave her a case of this. Her dorm did not allow personal rice cookers in their bedrooms due to safety restrictions.
5;Dog goodies;"I have 2 dogs who adore these.  All I have to say to them ""Who wants to chicken chips and wow they come running."
5;Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods;Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.
3;Ish;I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full-time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre-packaged foods.
2;So wrong;These snacks are only ok.  Beware.
4;Great snack for adults and kids!;We are gluten free and dairy free at our house and great products are hard to find!  Bakery on Main does GF/DF right!  This gronola is tasty. I have tried many kinds and have no complaints with this one.
3;Could have been stronger;We're really enjoying our new coffee maker, trying different types of coffee. This one wasn't our favorite.
5;Tasty, quick meal!;I love the Tiger Tiger product line, so I decided to give this a try.  Amazing!  I like to add tofu and extra veggies, but it's delicious on its own.
5;Best GF Pasta;Schar is by far my favorite gluten free pasta, it is so much better than brown rice or corn pasta.  Leftover pasta still tastes good for a couple days.
5;Numi teapot and blossoms;I love my little teapot and the tea blossoms that came with it. It came in a bamboo box that is lovely and well made.
1;disappointed;I've been trying to get ahold of you people saying that this wasn't delivered here.  seems it was delivered to PA instead of OR.
5;So good, just skip the toast!;If you like Huckleberries, this one is for you, just grab a spoon (like we did) and skip the toast.  Our only complaint, not enough .
5;Like Crunchy Nut? Caramel might be better!;I freakin' love Crunchy Nut, subtle, sweet and crunchy. But this caramel flavor might just be better, a bit stronger flavor but still complimenting the texture of the flakes rather than dominating it.
5;Refreshing coffee, a hit with the office;deployed in the military doesn't always mean you need to miss out on the finer things in life. Another co-worker and myself enjoy our coffee everyday and talking about the brewing smells that come with it.
1;Can cause bad reaction!!!;Bad side affects!!!<br /><br />It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people this gum has bad side affects. Don't worry, nothing is permanent, and if you've already consumed it and nothing happened, you're fine.
3;Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea;***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas.
2;Once burned, twice shy.;I got these breadcrumbs to make a special birthday meal (paneed chicken) for my boyfriend this past weekend. I scooped some out of the package and they looked, smelled and tasted great! I was so excited to be able to make this favorite dish of mine after not having it for nearly a year.
5;One of the best tasting granolas I have tried (dark chocolate and red berries);Received the dark chocolate and red berries version. From a nutritional standpoint it was a good choice having very low sugar amounts compared to a lot of granola and cereal products (6 grams).
5;Great on-the-go meal;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
5;such great treats!;I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.
5;PB2 - Peanut Protein Powder;PB2 is great.  A serving, 2 T of powder, is 1 point on Weight Watcher's Points Plus system.
1;Burned and Stale;It is definitely stale and burned. All three bags.
5;Nothing but protein;I love that this is pure protein. It tastes like malted milk w/o the sugar.
5;Love these CHIPS!!!!!;These are not just for people watching there weight they are for EVERYONE!!! They have great taste and come in lots of flavors. Try them soon.
4;Great taste - needs some work to make right;"I would give this five stars based on taste alone but I agree with some of the other reviews that the mix and directions out of the box need some tweaking to make it right.  I am in Denver, so altitude can play into it (although the box says it won't) and I find that I need to hold out a few tablespoons of water or add a bit of extra flour to get the right ""look"" to the bread ball."
4;Good for the system.;I bought this product because it was organic AND it contained the probiotic elements that my baby needed to help her digestive issues.  She does not eat it by itself, I add it to the home-made purees I make at home.
5;A most excellent summertime brew - try it iced!;Lipton's Honey-Lemon herbal tea is another winner. This has to be one of our favorite summertime brews for ice tea.
5;Crystal Light;If you like Crystal Light this is a great price and the product is fresh. I wished I would have purchased more.
5;my own lil store;Received package and was just as I wanted plus!  I enjoyed getting a piece of the candy from the box.  It arrived on time and I am ordering another box!  Just wish shipping was not so high but is not their fault.
5;Helped with illness and recovery!;I rescued a 3 year old Doberman Lily a few months ago who was not in the best of health, and after getting a checkup at the Vet, I found out that she has heartworms.  After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.
2;Way too weak for my tastes;What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets.
3;white hot chocolate;This hot chocolate is fairly good, however it is way too sweet for my taste.  Too much sugar taste and not enough chocolate.
5;Natural Calm;This product is perfect for what I needed--something easy on my digestive system that would help with muscle cramps.  It's very effective, and even better, it tastes good.
5;Best natural pain relief out there for severe menstrual cramps;This is a MIRACLE tea!<br /><br />I'm a 24 year old, otherwise healthy & fit woman who has always suffered from severe menstrual cramps. Every month, I used to take LOADS of ibuprofen and pamprin for 3-4 days at a time so that I could function and go to work.
5;Truly Addictive!;I got hooked on these delicious cookies when I found them at our local Costco.  And then they were gone.
5;MMMMMM Raspberry....MMMMM...Chocolate....;Wonderful coffee..
5;One of my very favorite flavors!;I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods.
4;Nice change of pace;Do you love hamburgers? Do you feel guilty about the fat and cholesterol of beef patties? Here's a suggestion--try bison burgers.<br /><br />More and more farmers are raising bison for their meat.
5;Best treats!;Great for training. Also perfect for stuffing in green Everlasting Treat Ball (another great product, especially for big chewers like my pitties).
5;Good Ginger Beer;This is a great tasting Ginger Beer, very full flavored and strong as it should be. Children will not like this soda, but grownups will, well if you like ginger.
5;My dog loves it, so do the cats;I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver.
5;Hard to find at good prices;I used to buy this from Whole Foods but was less than happy about the prices. I found this on Amazon and was able to save $2 a bag.
5;So good, you feel guilty eating it...but it's healthy!!;These Kind Bars are always in my purse. Being Gluten Free there are times when you need something to eat and there is nothing available.
1;deceptive advertising;all the ads state 2 box so to fool you they write with 2 tea bags. I personally noticed before i bought and didn`t buy because of it but others were bamboozled i see.
5;Great Cake Mix Esp. as a base;This is a great cake mix.  Really reduces the cooking time of baking gluten-free from scratch.
5;Exactly what I need to kick meals up a notch.;This is a large container of finely ground Ghost Pepper. I like the fine grind as it allows me to add just a little bit if that is all I want to do.
5;Convenient tea for travel;At home I brew tea and add lime to drink all day long.  When travelling that is difficult and the cold brew mint allows me to still drink my tea all day.
5;Delicious;Very happy with product. Roast is just like I like it, not too light, not too dark.
5;Wow;Love this water. I am so sorry to see it go away since nothing seems to equal the clean, crisp taste.
3;Has sucralose :(;This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.
5;No better cocoa;I don't think there is a better hot cocoa (especially at this price)on the market than Stephen's. It lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x-mas gifts.
5;Pickapeppa Sauce;I've been using Pickapeppa for at least 25 years.  My mother-in-law introduced it to me when she would pour it over cream cheese for an appetizer.
4;xylitol;As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe.
4;Kitchen Table Cheese Crisps;I ordered some of each flavor from Kitchen Table Gormet Wafer Crisps and several were good. The products shipped promptly.
3;Okay, But Could Have Better Taste (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars);I ordered this soda off Amazon Vine, and thought it was a very decent drink. If you ever had the soda Big Red, the black cherry flavor of The Switch tastes almost identical to it.
1;Awful;I am always looking for healthy snacks, and if It's good for me and it tastes bad, I will still eat it.  These are the exception.
4;tasty, east to use;The only mixes I have added to my water before are powdered and need to be shaken a lot. Not with this one.
4;Good coffee, great price.;This is a nice, dark, French roast. I usually buy from Coffee Bean Direct, but can't always find people to split 25 pounds so we can get the free shipping.
5;Great Treat;My dogs love this treat. I use it to train them and just for fun.
5;Good stuff;I had been eating pumpkin seeds for magnesium for a while, but there are times when I want to get the mineral without a bunch of added calories (like late at night before bed). This stuff is great for that.
4;nice...;This is a nice product.  It seems to help as it states it does--to calm and relax.
4;Fat free noodles;Miracle noodles are the best thing around.  I've made spegetti a number of times using miracle noodles and the taste is fantastic.
5;Gummylicious;Second time buying, five pounds is as much as any God fearing  person could or should want.  I'm going to hell.
4;The dogs love it, but the price just doubled.;Initially ordered this at slightly over a dollar per can. These are big cans (22 oz) instead of the smaller ones, so that was a good deal.
1;Bogus nutritional info?;Desired to purchase a very light low calorie higher protein snack for those occasional late night cravings. After some searching and reading of those nutritional statements seems all such amazon products have decided this sausage given the wondeful price would be fine.
5;This is the bomb;I took it for 3 months and now i see the difference..
5;THE BEST;It tastes EXACTLY like Starbucks' and much cheaper. What I like the most is that I can control how much matcha to put in! It'a tinsy bit sweet, but I find Starbucks' green tea latte to be a bit sweet too.
5;No kin to cat food;After checking out the different tunas, I found this product and ordered.  What a treat.
1;MY CATS TOOK ONE LOOK AND...............;My cats took one look at the Scratcher and they said to themselves - nope I'm not going near that thing.  They sniffed it and that was the end of that.
4;Good deal on green tea...;This matcha powder came in very nice packaging with a measuring spoon to use as well.  The quality of the green tea powder was a bit less than I expected (compared to my past experiences with matcha), but I think its all about quantity here - I've done a lot of creative stuff with the powder thusfar, my favorite being the homemade green tea ice cream.
2;Good Beer, slightly confusing directions.;Following the instructions given, I poured the malt into the hot water, and it instantly caramelized. I had huge chunks of rock hard malt floating in my batch.
5;Delicious and soothing;I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.
5;Above and beyond any other jarred sauce!!;I happened up on this at my local natural grocery store and it spoiled me for any other sauce! This is the BEST JARRED sauce I have found - better than Rao's, and better than Francis Ford Coppola's brand (my two previous faves). This tastes FRESH from the garden and can be used for so much more than a pasta sauce.
3;Smells good, but has a flavored coffee aftertaste;I was expecting the flavor of a chocolate glazed donut when you take a bite, but I forgot that this is really coffee. It does smell good, but it has an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about.
5;A GREAT PRODUCT FOR COLD SEASON;I found this product in the grocery store and tried it---cleared up my congestion and chest.  The combination of herbs keeps you clear.
1;Not a good purchase;This was not a good purchase for me. I'm a coffee fanatic and was hopeful of a great coffee experience.
5;Newest Type Dry Food for Persian Cats;I have recently gotten a Persian Cat from a Breeder.  She is 6 yrs.
5;Simply The Best;"These chocolates are much better than 5 stars!<br /><br />We found a Leonidas' Shop during a visit to Brussels, Belgium earlier this year and brought home 4 of the ""kilo"" Assortment Ballotins.  I was ready to call directly to Brussels to place an order for more, but found them in New York City, so."
5;GOOD FOOD!;I have used this product for five years now for both of my shelties. They like the taste, there coats are much smoother and it has lessened the number of seizures my female gets and there severity.
4;Will do, but have had better;This product is creamy and easy.  It is pretty good if you have never had the real thing.
5;Great taste that even the kids love!;I like it because it's not greasy, and not so salty that my lips burn.  Just the right amount of salt to give it some flavor.
5;Favorite K-Cup;Of all the K-Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button.
5;Fruitables (all flavors);"I HIGHLY recommend Fruitables--she absolutely LOVES them, and there's no junk or fillers in them. Made in USA, calories are reasonable, good all-purpose size, and they smell like ""people"" cookies--much nicer to have sitting in the kitchen than, say, liver-flavored snacks."
5;Noirot Orange Flower water;I used this in Baklava.  Smells good and the Baklava tasted great.
5;holy molee this is good;If you like indian food, this is definitely a great base to start with.<br /><br />We have made have made it with chicken, but I have been told that it tastes really good with other types of meat and vegan options.
1;This is NOT the original Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter !;I hate to be the only one with 1 star review here, but I have to warn - I ordered Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter because I loved the original. However, they recently (Sept.
1;Olives arrived slimy and gross;I've purchased bulk olives from Amazon twice before and they where great. These olives I just recieved today must be many years old.
1;food coloring not wanted;This tea tastes okay, but the food coloring is an unnecessary and unhealthy added ingredient. I agree with another reviewer, that there must be other unlisted ingredients, because it doesn't taste like green tea.
5;really good chips;These chips are salty with a hint of sweet. They are crisp and crunchy.
5;Love this tea!;Most mint teas I have tried have either a strong or fake mint flavoring.  I am also not a fan of green teas.
5;Very Good!;Great tasting, love that its fair trade, good company, worth the money. If you like pumpkin you will like this.
5;Awesome;Decent packaging, and amazing for baking. I couldn't believe how much more volume it gave to my gluten-free breads.
5;My favorite cereal -- now called Optimum Cranberry Ginger;Nature's Path just changed the name. But the cereal is identical.
4;Expensive, but Taste Great;I really like these bread crumbs.  Whole grain bread crumbs are hard to find where I live, so I was glad I tried these.
1;The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?;I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered.
3;Peanut Butter Cookies;These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.<br />We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out.
4;Need More Info On Kili's Package;Old Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix was fragrant when added to 8 oz. of  boiling water, and appeared to be darker than in smaller cup in the photo.
2;great idea, needs work;Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.
4;Not as much blueberry as I expected, but still a good cup of coffee;This really just tastes like regular coffee, but has a blueberry smell in my opinion.  Still a good cup of coffee nonetheless.
5;Excellent Product, The Best Oil You Can Use;The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.
5;Mild pleasantly sweet cofee;This is my favorite k-cup coffee. It has a wonderful aroma, and a pleasantly sweet taste in a nice mild coffee.
4;Good enough;This coffee has a nice flavor and aroma and will be well appreciated by folks who prefer their brew to be on the milder end of the spectrum.  I appreciate the company's social responsibility in terms of fair trade and child labor practices although in terms of waste, any single serving coffee product creates more than its fair share.
4;Breadshop's Granola;Breadshop's Raspberry 'n Cream Granola is the best breakfast treat going. Not only is it a healthy food, but it's a delicious way to start the day.
4;Gluten Free French Bread;This bread is very good for gluten free bread.  I used it in my turkey stuffing, and it received excellent comments from those who had also eaten the same dressing made with gluten sourdough bread.
5;Gum;Since the grocery stores don't seem to carry this, I checked here for it and glad I did.  This stuff is awesome.
2;Don't waste your money;This is a good but unremarkable toy for the very light chewer in your life.  It's basically just a fabric bone that you soak in water.
1;Tea?  What Tea?;Honestly, that's what I thought throughout trying this tea.  The smell and taste is entirely of cinnamon.
4;A fine chocolate for mixing coffee beverages;I'm afraid that many of the negative reviews about this product rather miss the point.  They even state on the Tassimo website that these discs are best used with the addition of marshmallows or milk, but even without this information, most people would be able to figure it out for themselves.
4;Husband loves them!;My husband has been dragged into my Vegan world because of our health and he was a great meat and potatoes kind of guy.  However, he loves pasta and noodles of all kind so I have been able to entice him with some of the great products Amazon sells.
5;Awesome;My 2 month puppy had a weak cartilage and I was adviced to give her this product in a week her ear when up thta was amazing. People did not want to buy her because they thought it was a defect and now her cartilage is not weak it is better and I have so mnay people interested in my puppy.
4;Not bad - Had better - I'd buy it again;"The flavor of the the Fog Chaser is pretty good. Bold, yet not ""too"" strong."
5;Amazing!!!;I love this stuff. It tastes just like normal ice cream, which is weird at first because of the different texture from the freeze-drying, but it tastes great! It melts in your mouth when you eat it.
4;Lobster Salad is Delicious;The lobster salad is the main attraction here, nice and chunky with lots of lobster meat. This is not an overly moist salad, the main ingredient is lobster.
5;My favorite beans;These are some of my favorite beans. I've purchased this brand a number of times in various roasts, and I've never been disappointed.
5;The best yet;This coffee is delightful the absolute bee's knees, real deal. I'm happy I found this turkish style coffee on Amazon, no more trips to the Greek store for coffee.
5;A great alternative to K-Cups;Yup not a K-Cup. If you don't like the non-plastic cup, then don't buy them.
5;Gopher Getter;I remember my dad using a similar item (made of wood) years ago to keep our yard gopher free. The new generation Black Box is plastic, but works just as well.
5;Best Chocolate I have Used for Baking;The taste is strong and delish..
5;Good Deal;I love ginger root tea, and one package was almost as expensive as the six pack. I was able to share with friends, and still have two unopened boxes.
3;Good Value, Decent Taste;Good price on Organic Almond Butter. I certainly have no problem eating it, but personally prefer the taste of  Artisana.
4;decent taste with a kick of chocolate in the center;This is a good addition to my evening snacking cereals.  I'm a sugar and chocolate lover
4;Good but not great;Better than Taster's Choice, which it resembles in color and texture, but its a poor second to Starbucks Via Italian. I'm trying to find a lesser priced alternative to Via but Hula Girl is not that.
5;So convenient;Arrived well packaged and just as described.  Also expiration date was not for another 6 months.
4;Love my Chai;I had to give up on coffee because it bothered my stomach and spent sometime in the world of teas before coming across Chai. Chai tea is now my favorite drink.
5;Gave as gift, friend went nuts!;I have some friends that grew up in the South.  One talked about Moon Pies and how much he loved them.
5;The best corn chips out there;Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.
5;Very yummy.;I love Larabars- I like to keep one on me in case I get super hungry when I'm out and about because the protein and fat content makes them very filling. Because I'm gluten intolerant and also do not eat highly processed foods, it can be pretty difficult to find something to eat away from home, but when I get really hungry I get ill anyway.
3;Hard-to-find liquid version;I only use this stuff once a day (coffee), and I probably would fail a taste test vs. other brands.
2;Over Priced;I thought this was a poor assortment as I was looking for coffee, not tea or hot chocolate.  Perhaps I should have read the details a little closer.
2;Didn't work for my corgi;This food made my dog sick with vomiting and diarrhea for even two weeks after the transition from his other food. I've done my research, I think this is a complete kibble but too rich for Charlie.
1;White Chocolate Mousse Calorie Control;The testure is very light and that is good.  The taste is very strong of artificial sweetner.
5;very nice tea with an interesting plus;This orange tea has more orange in it than any other brand! It also tastes the best. I drink it iced and add lemon and pineapple juice.
5;Great Old Fashioned Grits;I'm very pleased with this purchase.  The fact that they are Gluten Free is a bonus.
5;Scored Big On Our Party's Fun Factor;Grandpa Po's Originals scored big on our party's fun factor. These half-baked nuggets of organic popcorn blended with dry-roasted soybeans were a surprise hit with both kids and adults.
5;Delicious, and the packaging is fine.;The tea is delicious, and is truly double-spice. I usually steep my teas for an unreasonably long time to get a strong flavor, and with this one I don't have to.
3;Good but price is way too high;The Cappucino is good, not too strong and not weak.  Hubby likes it more than I did and he's the real coffee drinker around here, I asked if he'd buy it and he said he'd definitely buy it if the price is good.
2;Not that great;I wasn't crazy about this cereal. I thought it would be a little like grape nuts, but it really was like small pieces of their bread dried up and crumbled (I do like their bread, but not this way).
5;gel;I will be using this product a lot this summer when I make jams and jellies.  Can never have enough of this product.
5;Lovely cuppa tea;I love this green tea and the added benefits of Acai berry!  I order this and the pomegranate tea 6 boxes at a time.  No additives no extra flowers etc.
4;dogs loved them, but;my two Goldens loved these, and I am sure that they are good quality, but they downed them too quickly.  I need chews that will keep them busy for a while.
4;Re-Rating;Okay, I jumped the gun, because they were sending me the review information, before I received my chips, so I thought I would be honest, and indicate that I have not received them, and I wasn't happy about not receiving them. However overall, the service is not bad, and my chips are on the way.
5;Absolutely the BEST Sugar Replacement!;I have been extremely satisfied with the quality of Ideal brand white and brown sugar. I have used both the white and brown sugar in everything including drink mixes, syrups, cakes, pies and caramels and couldn't be happier.
5;Gift purchase;I buy Senseo Coffee Pods for my brother.  He can no longer buy it at any local store and it his favorite.
4;Old dog loves these, too;Sure, puppies love these little treats, but I bought them for our 11-year-old mini-mutt that only has 3 teeth.  I needed treats that were easy to break into little bits, easy to chew, and easy to swallow, with enough healthy calories to maintain her weight.
5;yummy;this is a perfect snack for a person who is on the go..
3;Wouldn't buy it again;I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.
4;"The ""price reduction"" is due to smaller quantity per box";Love the cereal and eat it almost every day of the work week.  I just noticed, however, that the newer box of Kashi Whole Grain Puffs sitting on my shelf is dramatically thinner than the box from my last shipment.
4;Good but caution if you don't like the flavor of soy;Yum. I loooove chocolate milk and indulge of plenty of chocolate soy milk because I'm lactose intolerant.
5;I must be nuts;Kar's Sweet `n Salty snack bags are an excellent product.  If you like this kind of trail mix with fruit, chocolate and nuts this snack is for you.
5;Brown sugar can't get more real than this;I've tasted a lot of underprocessed, raw, or natural sugars, and chewed on sugar cane in my day, so I think I know what I like: something that tastes like dried sugar cane juice.  One taste, and I'm pretty convinced this is the real thing, authentic top-shelf brown sugar in convenient, attractive cube form.
5;Canidae is great.;I had read a lot about the health benefits of using Canidae for my dogs.  I think I have seen evidence of healthier skin in my dog with skin issues.
5;Irish Breakfast Tea;Great tasting tea.  Much cheaper to purchase in bulk from Amazon than at the grocery store.
5;Superior Popcorn;This is one of the best of the Orville Redenbacher line.  Flavorful, with just the right amount of salt and butter, it's a classic that never fails to please.
5;Perfect summer tea;this is the best iced green tea I've ever had
5;No more breast milk!;Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply.
2;taste bad;My kids don't like the taste so i have been drinking it. So far I see no difference and it taste bad.
5;Loved the Dark Chocolate;
4;Red Clover Tea;I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.
5;Excellent on toast;If you like anchovies, this will be a hit with you.  Use very sparingly, as they suggest.
4;Dog Preference;Our Cocker Spaniel is spoiled on all kinds of treats including table leftovers but she always has room for a Greenie.  Her dental hygene is also important to us and the Greenies seem to do the job.
5;Best Chips out there!!!;I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc..
5;Good peppers but expired date;"I love peppers and have ordered from different companies including World Specialties but will not again after the sent me habaneros with a ""best by.."
5;Stash has always delivered in quality tea.;We have purchased several different black teas from Stash and have yet to be dissapointed in their products.  Several of their black teas are such favorites with our family and friends that we placed them on an automatic reorder.
5;So Yummy!;I love Next Organic Dark Chocolate Nutes! They are not overly sweet or too hard to chew. The dark chocolate coating is tasty.
5;Best Coffee;We have been using 8 O'Clock Columbian for years. We grind our own with a burr grinder and use a TechniVorm Moca Master brewer and the combination will make the national so-called coffee house stuff taste, well, just like stuff.
4;PROUD DAD;The Chocolates were great to issue to those who don't smoke cigars.  Everyone enjoyed them.
5;Better than Instant;Make an instant espresso latte or add a dash to your regular cup for a smooth flavor.  Once you try it, you'll always want to have it on hand.
5;So far, so good;Arrived on time. Meant to be gifts.
5;Yummm!... what a nice treat!;Let me start by saying that I can't stand hot chocolate mixes that you add water to ..
5;One of my Favorites;Love the strong taste it has. I will reach for this every time when I have it.
4;Organic Chocolatey Goodness!;These bars have a lovely chocolate flavor, but it isn't intense.  There are no chunks or chips or chocolate, but rather just the entire bar is chocolate flavored.
3;It was Okay;This coffee was okay. I enjoy flavored coffee.
5;Tasty!;I fried my first turkey at thanksgiving 2011. I read a lot about the process looking for the best recipes and tips.
4;Nice on-the-go packaging and tasty product;This package comes with 6 eight graham cracker pouches.  The pouches are made of the same type of material (wax paperish) that normal honey grahams come in, so it's difficult, if not impossible, to re-seal them in their own packaging if you don't eat the entire 8 cracker sleeve in one sitting.
5;Great Product....Great Company;I have been purchasing pill pockets for about 6 months now due to my 7 yr old Beagle needing her medicine twice a day.  She is excited to eat them everyday and doesn't have a clue her medicine is in them.
2;Great Chew Toy!;I usually have only great things to say about most Nylabone chews, however, the shape/style of this one I do not like.  It also seems to splinter more quickly than the other products.
5;Delicious candies!;I love citrus candies and am always looking for new varieties to try.  The three flavors in the bag are orange, tangerine, and lemon.
5;Yes, coconut coffee has great flavor.;Coconut and coffee fans applaud - Green Mountain Coffee delivers on quality and flavor. Add some coconut creamer to boost the flavor and you'll want more.
3;damaged can in group;One of the cans arrived damaged with a collection of bugs in it.  The product itself is fine in the other cans, and I am using the rest.
4;Hottest hydration drink - Coconut water;I've seen some of the information about the benefits of coconut water.  I'm sick of drinking Gatorade.
5;Big hooves, great value;The hooves are HUGE, and this is a great price for the amount received. I wasn't sure what 5 lbs would look like, and I'll confess I haven't counted them, but it's at least 30 or so.
5;So expensive now, replaced with Baronet Coffee Pods for my Senseo machine;I enjoyed the Senseo coffee pods for 2 years, and now they become so expensive since Senseo withdrawn from the US market.<br /><br />Google it and found others had the same problem too.
5;Wonderful!!!!;I'm glad I found these because first off i love them and second they are very hard to find in my area. They always arrive fast(they have lighting fast shipping), they're always fresh, and packed perfectly in the box and arrive in good condition.
5;Good taste, more than one small size coffe out of one bag.;I am using this indeed with a Senseo machine.<br />On the directions, it is indicated that one should use one bag for a small coffee size and two for the large size.
5;Super cat food;All the Weruva cat food is great!  It's pricey, but more affordable through Amazon.  I may set it up on subcribe and save.
1;Awful;Good price but the coffee is horrible.  It tastes both sour and bitter.
5;Yummy;By far the best whey protein supplement that I have ever tasted.  Smooth and lump-free.
5;The Best Chips;I was introduced to Madhouse Munchies some years ago and they still as impressive.  From the moment you open a bag of Madhouse Munchies you will be greeted with the crunchiest, tastiest and healthiest potato chips.
5;Amazing!;We're HOOKED on this stuff.  This stuff is really great, and I love that it doesn't have a ton of sugar.
5;delicious!;It took me awhile to decide to order because of all the reviews, but I am so glad I did. This is one of my new favorites.
4;Dog loved it!;My dog loved this brand and flavor.  However, beware of AMZN's packing/handling because I've received dented cans which broke seal making several of the cans in the package go bad.
5;great coffee;I gave this coffee to a friend of mine on her birthday.  She said it was excellent coffee.
5;Gift;I received this item as a gift and was very excited when I got it. It looked exactly as it does in the picture and the food and snacks provided taste really good, and there is so much that I was able to share it with co-workers and still have snacks for at home.
5;I love this puppy food;I had one of my dogs die as a result of the China dog food scandal. Now I won't buy anything but made in the USA.
5;Our Schnauzers Love It!;We have a 4yo miniature Schnauzer and 6mo giant Schnauzer. We only wanted to buy one type of food for both, so this worked out perfectly.
5;great tea;Start your day out right with a cuppa this tea for breakfast! Nothing else comes close to its smoothness. Even the grandkids love it.
5;Good treats!;Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training.
4;Good Japanese Green Tea;I was pleasantly surprised by how good this Japanese green tea blend is.  I feel that many of the negative reviewers are not familiar with Japanese green tea.
5;Tasty and healthy;"This is a great product, very tasty and at the same time having all kinds of good natural nutrients. I buy it on ""Subscribe and Save"" program, getting 5 lb."
2;Purchased explicitly for flea problem......;NOTE: This review is based only on the advertisement of this product as a flea deterrent.<br /><br />With all the rain in the Northeast this summer we are really battling fleas with our two labs.
5;Good Bread - Fair Price;I really appreciated being able to buy Gluten Free Udi's Bread online through Amazon with free shipping.  The closest store where we can purchase this bread is 30 minutes away.
5;Good coffee;Just regular breakfast coffee..
5;dog toy;My dog loves to eat a meal or two from the tugajug. She is very active and this product is just right for her.
5;Good tea!;Licorice Spice is a great tea. A touch of spicy and sweet.
5;Very Tasty!;Needless to say these cookies didn't last long once they were opened. They reminded my wife of the Tagalongs the Girl Scouts used to sell.
5;THERE WAS A DOG WHO HAD A BONE AND DINGO WAS IT'S NAME OH!;My three doggies love these and instead of singing BINGO I sing Dingo and they come a running. They take a little more time than some of these other treats to eat which is always a plus.
5;Great stuff!;I love this stuff and finding it on Amazon is great!  I'm trying to go Gluten free, but live my oatmeal.  This stuff tastes great and helps me maintain my diet.
5;love my litttle dogs;My little ones love their teenie greenies. It is so easy to order them from Amazon.
5;works for my cat!;We have one cat with both a sensitive stomach and hairball problems. I've tried quite a few treats, and these are one of the few I can give her that don't come back up.
4;Does what it says...;I read many of the reviews and had mixed feelings about this product. I am glad I decided to purchase it anyway.
3;Good baby food, but not as great for travel as you might think;I buy this baby food for the flavor combination.  I have tried the Apricot and Pear myself and it's delicious.
2;Not as pictured.;I bought this for a Christmas gift, but I will be returning. There is no box or packaging as pictured, it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes, which would be fine if I was just buying for myself but not for a gift.
5;Baby loves them and so easy;My son loves the flavors and they are so easy for him to eat and healthy. Love them I reccommend them to all my friends with little kids.
4;Smelly and Melty but Tasted Ok;I am a person that if my food smells off, I probably won't eat it. When I opened the wrapper, I got this funny whiff of odd sugary something.
5;Cannot stop eating...;CHOCOLATE. When going GF 10 years ago, I was bummed cause there was suck a lack of store bought goodies.
5;Choc/PB Delight are the best...;These are a staple in our house of one diabetic and one trying to lose weight. We do the subscribe and save here on amazon, and chocolate peanut butter delight seems to be the flavor we like the best.
5;Amazing stuff;I'm so glad I found this - plus with the subscribe & save it's a huge deal for what I love to have post-workout. I sometimes throw it in a salad too!<br />Great to mix with a ton of spinach, a banana or mango, avocado, & some hemp milk/coconut milk/water.
4;Nutty green goo...;I am sure hemp seed butter is good for the body, but the taste is not so good. I got it as a trial and although it tasted a bit on the nutty/bittery side, I would give a 4 stars because of the benefits and the ease of ordering & making a fine product available without putting a ding in the wallet.
5;Really, Really Good;After eating just half of one, I know that I will be buying another box. This is nothing even close to the fruit+nut bars sold in grocery stores.
3;Light mistake;I love coconut.  I love coffee.
5;Delicious;When you need a healthy snack or do not have time for breakfast just grab a Kind bar.  They are so good and are gluten free.
5;great product;I enjoy the syrup from Monin. Glad it is organic and more natural.
5;Hannah's Sausage;Oh boy, These are a winner at my house.  We used to buy them locally, but they are no longer carried.
1;Don't waste your money!;It's amazing that this product is still on the market.  It is so expensive and so disappointing.
5;I Love This Stuff! Great on a Hot Day! Much Better Than Gatorade!;I work out in the hot sun and during the summer months I drink lots of water and in the past sports drinks. I try to watch what I eat and drink and have found sports drinks to loose their appeal after awhile.
5;For Chip Lovers;I love potato chips and when I go at it I always eat more than I should.  A whole bag of chips can be more than 1000 calories and 80 grams of fat.
5;Great Bags;I really like using these bags, as they are waterproof, so no leakage, it also reduces the amount of smell! They are not the strongest bags, but strong enough for the purpose. They will tear if you throw them against wall etc.
4;smoky delicious;smoky delicious with aroma that I am looking for.  I drink it hot in black with blue agave.
5;One of my cat's favorites;My cat likes many of the Whiska's Purrfectly..
2;Poor Product Description On Unilever & Amazon's Behalf;"Had Amazon written in its ""product features"" that Ultra Shea nourishing balm was intended for relaxed and natural hair, I would have known better (buzz words for ethnic hair).  Unfortunately I took Amazon's brief description (scalp dryness) at face value."
5;Best gluten-free dairy-free chips;These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips.  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it's nice to find ones that I can eat.
5;Yum, Yum, Yum;This product brought me back to the old day's that's for sure. It was soooooo<br />good!!!!!! The dark chocolate was absolutely delicious! I know that I will be purchasing more from this company & you should too.
4;Our Long Haired Doxies love em';We have two long haired miniture Doxies, one year old.  They have been raised on Natures Select and Stella & Chewy's since they were 3 months, and chicken is their favorite.
5;Mrs. Wages Bread'n Butter Pickle Mix;This is an extremely hard to find item in my area. My wife is happy for this item.
5;If you love Rooibos - do try this blend;This Provence Rooibos tea blend is quite delicious. 4oz is enough to make loads of tea.
5;These are the best chocolates out there;I truely think these are the best tasting chocolates available on the market. I happen to love hazelnut and chocolate so this is just a heavenly way of mixing both.
4;A Fine Dessert Coffee;I love Starbucks coffees. Always have.
1;Worst Coffee Ever;This is the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. I have drunk many cups of Folgers coffee in my life
5;Just What I Wanted!;I was recently turned on to the health benefits of white tea, so I decided to try it out. Apparently, white tea doesn't have much flavor on it's own, which are why there are so many flavored whites.
5;Good treats;These are low-fat, low-cal. I have never seen a dog who didn't love them.
5;PG Tips Tea: Mum knows best;My English mother-in-law came to visit us in 1968 and, wisely, brought along her favourite brand of tea, PG Tips. So, it's been our house tea ever since, improved only by my spouse's collection of seven or more tea pots collected over time.
1;Pooptacularly Bad;I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.
5;Good, but beans are always cramped in can;I LOVE black beans. It was nice to find them in a BPA free can, so that I don't have to spend hours soaking beans myself if I don't want industrial toxins in my beans.
5;Delish & Reasonable!;Green Mountain Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig pods. I make the big cup, add 1/4 c.
2;Not Organic as advertised!;Amazon list this cereal as being certified organic. It is not organic! The company website only shows 4 of their many cereal products to be organic.
5;Tasty;I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times
4;Really salty, but good.;The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.
5;My daughter really liked this!;I bought this as a study gift for my daughter and she really liked it!  She is away at college and she really enjoyed the nuts and fruit.  It was a nice change from other snack gifts that load up with sugar and other not so healthy things.
5;YUMMY!;We bought this since it is gluten free and nut free. It is PERFECT for Celiacs and for packing in kids lunch or snack for school that limit nuts and peanuts.
5;Excellent Coffee;Makes a great cup of coffee. Rich and mild.
5;K-Cups;This K-Cup coffee is very flavorful, it tastes great straight away. No need  for cream or sweetener.
5;My dog is addicted;I would give these six (or more) stars if I could.<br /><br />My dog is absolutely addicted to these biscuits
5;Delicious sugar free candy;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Terrific Chai;Second time I have order this and is just as good the this time. Good deal ordering thru Amazon and tastier than what I can get at Starbucks.
5;joymuns;A very good flavored coffee.  It is a great breakfast, first-thing in the morning coffee.
4;Nice Blend of Chocolate and Hazelnut;While a hundred bags of tea seemed overwhelming at first, given my two-cup-a-day consumption, it won't take me long to get through. I drink a cup after breakfast and another after dinner.
5;Great meatless protein snack;I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor.
4;Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the 'special' bags.;I think this is the best vanilla tea I have tried. I thought the tea bags made it pretty pricey - so I'll try the loose leaf next time.
4;Awesome!!!!;This is a wonderful item! I add fruit and flaxseed when making the shake. Tastes great! I needed something that did not have the Soy in it.
5;Wonderful Dog Food;We have searched and searched for a food that would meet our dog's nutritional needs as well as address her issues with allergies,this food was totally the answer for us and it's not near as expensive as all of the one's the vet's wanted to put her on. She loves it, we love it and that makes everyone happy.
2;Not for my dog with copper storage syndrome;I purchased this product because it advertised that it contained zinc and it does. My dog is on zinc maintainance because he has copper storage disease.
5;My Favorite Decaf;This is by far my favorite evening cup, you would have to be a very discerning drinker to even know its decaf. Tully's coffees are always superior quality and this is no exception, full-bodied but not overpowering like most french roast decafs.
5;New favorite at our house!;Quaker Oatmeal Squares with cinnamon have an excellent taste, crunch, staying power in milk. Perfect out of hand for a snack instead of potato chips or cookies.
5;Plain GOOD Coffee;I purchased because it was on special, and I did read the other reviews, which were encouraging..
5;Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. It's like magic.;Turns royal icing black, black, black with one squirt. Amazing! Sorry for the repetitions, but it really is fabulous .
5;Needs a little more chocolate and a little less coating flavor;This is getting real close to perfection.  I do agree with the reviews that indicate a need for a little more chocolate and a little less coating.
5;She loves it;Since starting Wellness wet food, not only does my cat love it, but certain problems she has had cleared up - throwing up, and chronic watery eyes have disappeared. One thing - she gets finicky about eating it when it's cold.
3;Nutritionally Empty & Tastes Kinda Funky. Not a Total Wash, Though;Okay. It's a Velveeta skillet dinner
5;Good coffee;I love this coffee and got a good price on it. shipping was very quick and easy.
5;yummm;these things are soo fudgey! I could eat them every day for the rest of my life. Right after I write this review I am going to buy ten more boxes.
4;They like em'....they like em'.;My cats simply just love em'..
5;Kenya AA K cups;The Kenyan highland cooperatives consistently get high marks for their coffee. The Green Mountain product is the only K cup access I've found.
4;Tea;This stuff is really good for you, has provided me with more energy and I am 80, so i recommend it to all ages. Its a little bitter, but you develop a taste, also drink it while eating Ginger snaps.
1;False advertising?;I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written.
5;Excellent;A great source of energy booster. You should have it before you hit the Gym and you will how quickly the energy booster kicks in.
5;wonderful lunch!;I keep these in the freezer for a wonderful lunch. Served with bottled Italian sauce it is quick and tasty one dish meal.
5;Amazing chocolate;For dark chocolate lovers, this is an amazing chocolate bar.  The flavor of the cocoa is very complex, reminiscent of coffee, cherries, almonds.
5;My favorite online coffee;Very nice roast. An aroma to die for.
1;Awful;"These things are awful. I was thinking I would be getting a soft, moist chocolate cake with creamy filling - similar to a hostess cupcake but with the ""oreo taste"" - these things are awful."
5;Fast, Easy & Hits the Spot;I love Crystal Light On the Go.  I really like the Green Tea Rasberry flavor too.
5;Cat Treats;One of our Ragdoll Cats has an allergy to chicken and this is the only treat we could find that does not contain chicken.It is a quality all natural product.
5;Favorite everyday brew;eight O'Clock has been a favorite of mine for years. Loved the convenience of having it delivered instead of having to run to the store.
5;The best pretzel snack you can buy.;These are absolutely mouth-watering.  About 10 nibblers will cost you:<br /><br />-130 calories<br />-3 grams of fat(1.
1;Can't get anyone to eat these.;I bought these for my dachshund, and he wants nothing to do with them.  I tried to give them to a friend's dog, and he rejected them as well.
4;Good product;Really good in hot foods such as oatmeal and coffee. Does not dissolve well in cold foods or cold liquids.
4;Juice;Picante Clamato juice is just right for a breakfast juice drink. Just enough bite for a good flavor and wake up your taster.
1;moldy taste;I thought this product tasted musty or moldy and would not recommend.  As if it had sat in a warehouse too long.
5;Great flavor and flexibility;Great for all sorts of recipes, adds good flavor.  Especially nice mixed with sour cream, cream cheese, etc.
4;My Great Dane Loves it;I bought this item because I wanted a treat that would last a little longer and keep my dogs attention.  I use this treat with this toy as a special occasion treat and my dog loves it every time.
2;Awful to taste.;These taste really awful. I've tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible.
1;Missing candy...;I'm hoping to receive this soon.  I like Swiss Colony's offerings and want to get this candy out and in dishes well before Christmas.
5;Delicious and a good buy.;My wife and son can't eat wheat. This d'Abruzzo variety of spelt has a lighter color and more delicate flavor than the whole spelt variety, so those not used to the flavor of spelt are more likely to enjoy it.
3;yummy but this price is way too much;24 bags for $22? thats very expensive. sure they taste really good especially the strawberry/banana and the fuji apples but they have this variety pack at Costco for $12.
5;Unexpected surprise - makes great appreciation gift!;Each year there are 20 or so people I like to give a little gift at Christmas time to people like ballet teachers, daycare workers, etc.  The costs add up pretty quickly at a time of year when there are lots of other costs, so I am always on the look-out for something that is nice, and affordable.
5;Best Tea Ever;I started drinking red rooibos tea when I gave up caffeine. I especially like the Celestial Seasonings blends because the flavors are satisfying and the price is reasonable.
5;CATS FAVORITE;My Cat just loves Fancy Feast foods. She refuses to even look at any other brand I place in her dish! This is a 23# Feline.
5;a couscous thing;I found what I had been searching for on Amazon
5;great treat;my girls attend a school that has a no-nut policy, so it is imperative that I find food for their lunches that is relatively healthy without nuts. This fits the bill.
5;fresh and good flavor;I got the gum because my dentist recommended it to keep cavities at bay. It arrived quickly and was in good condition.
5;Lili's favorite time of the day from Amazon.com.......Smokehouse chicken poppers treats;"My little 1 year old Lili, who is part mini Dachshund and we think Chihuahua, she absolutely loves these Smokehouse treats, before this product came along, they  ate different treats and had stomach issues, got fatter and sometimes just did not actually eat it. Lili likes to sit up to get one, gives kisses to get one and loves it so much when I roll her one across the living room floor, this yummy chicken poppers makes have a fun too, she chases it down, throws it in the air and her tails wags intensely - it becomes an eatable ""ball"" game."
3;Better than plain water;Overall, not bad.  It is certainly better than plain water, but it tastes a bit like chemicals.
2;Not accurate;"In the description it says ""about 800"" Whenever I received mine me and my wife count all of them and we received 383. This isn't even close to 800 unless you break them in half."
5;Great set but can be bought cheaper elsewhere!;I bought this set at Bed, Bath & Beyond last night for $19.99, plus I used a 20% off coupon.
5;Recommended with orange slices;For purposes of this review, I made a cup of Yogi Green Tea (Pure Green 16 Count Box) and now present my findings.  I used Chrystal Springs Distilled Water, which I brought to a rapid boil and then poured over the tea bag in a medium sized mug.
5;Candy;I live in MS, so its difficult to find the candy that i grew up with in San Diego. I love this candy.
5;Great Product;What a great service to have the large bags of dog food delivered. It came just in time although I won't time it so close next time.
2;not Donut Shop coffee;This is not the same as the 'Donut Shop' coffee that comes with the Keurig Brewer.  It is not very good tasting coffee.
3;Okay but not the best of the MTR soups;The MTR line of soups in the handy and easy-to-store shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  The Mixed Vegetable Italian Style soup is a mild tomato and vegetable broth with a few pieces of overcooked pasta and some small chunks of potato and pieces of cabbage, beans, and peas.
5;Perfect Tea;I LOVE this tea and am so glad Amazon carries it as it is hard to find in the stores. The one place I know that carries it is way more expensive than buying it online.
5;Crunchy and yummy!;These get an A+ from our crew. They were yummy and crunchy with whole grain nutrition.
5;Luv its taste...;I really liked this green tea mixed with superfruits, but beware the green tea doesn't look dark and looks diluted.  Maybe because of the superfruits.
4;Good chips, more cheese;They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture.
3;It gets you clean;To some extent, soap is soap, whatever the form.  What makes this Dove Body Wash better or worse than similar products?<br /><br />It gets you clean:  that's good.
5;Best ever;this is the most flavor I have ever tasted in an Orange flavored tea. Stash really knows what they are doing.
4;Yummy;I love planters peanuts & I'd never had a nut bar before these but I can clearly see that I've been missing out.  These are quite yummy.
5;The best chocolate bar, hands down;I love chocolate.  Good chocolate.
5;LOVE THIS COFFEE!;I just tried this coffee in the Keurig edition while waiting for my car to be repaired and, being the pumpkin coffee junkie that I am, well, temptation just provided me with a new favorite! This coffee has just the right amount of spice - not too heavy or too light, and just makes the perfect cup. Don't try Millstone's - yuck! Had SO much troule just choking that one down.
1;Tastes OK but olives had pit fragments & one package had moldy olives!;The taste of these olives is OK. They taste like Greek olives and are a bit soft.
5;Great for big dogs;I have a four month old st Bernard puppy and have always fed him and my 6 year old German shep hill science.  I did some research and found out how awful that stuff is.
5;Tasty light brew!;Toscana Decaf is a water process decaf.  It has a light tangy taste, brews consistently every cup and is perfect for cold winter mornings and late night after dinner cups.
5;Corn Nuts Tasted Great;The local stores in Hampton, VA stopped carrying Corn Nuts several years ago. I missed them so much I decided to give these a try.
2;Our Dogs Chew On Them, But Don't Finish;I have two Doodles, a brother and a sister, and the male eats just about everything you put in front of him and many things you don't!  He seemed very interested in these and even the female took them into her jaws and scurried off.  Alas, we found most of them later secreted in different parts of the living room.
5;Best decaf tea;This decaf tea is excellent. Best I have ever found.
5;gyro sauce;You have to try this sauce,<br /><br />i have brought similar sauces in fine gourmet stores but they don't compare.<br /><br />It's great.
4;crunchy oat-y cookie;We enjoy this cookie at our house.  I love that they have this wheat free alternative to animal crackers.
5;CDM coffee;We love this coffee and have a hard time finding it where we live. Usually, we either buy it in large quantities when we go back home to South Louisiana.
5;Grandson fav;This is my grandsons fav flavor. He will readily reach for a juice in these conveniently sized containers.
5;great for gluten free;"I was relieved when I found these crackers as they are like ""real"" things that are not G.F."
5;Best deal on Greenies;Most dogs LOVE Greenies, and they are supposed to be great for their teeth, but they are also quite expensive. I found this 96 count package on Amazon for under 25.
5;We LOVE this tuna.;The taste and quality are consistent and to us, it's worth the money. It tastes fresh and never has that canned tuna taste I get from the name brands.
1;anything but fresh. prefrozen little slimmy droppings. dont buy here;the supposed fresh berries came today. slimmy and prefrozen and grey.
1;Horrible taste, falls apart;This stuff has a really weird aftertaste. Even if you cook it per instructions and run cold water over it immediately, it falls apart.
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;So yummy;They taste so good. Easy on my stomach when I am running.
5;Tasty!;A nice case of chips that are quite tasty. I definitely enjoy the Kettle Sea Salt and Black Pepper.
1;Packagine HORRIBLE;I did not get to taste the worms, because when they got to me, the package was OPEN and worms were all out in the cardboard box! Gross! I returned them, but noticed that the plastic container they come in LOOKS like it has a seal on it, but if you try to open it on the opposite end, it opens. So, I didn't know if they were tampered with.
5;The Best Espresso Coffee Ever;I started to drink Lavazza while living in Europe. I am glad that I can order it through Amazon.
5;Fantastic tea;
5;Delicious!;I was recently introduced to coconut water and really enjoyed it, however it was one of the sugar added brands that only had 80% juice (with pulp). After some searching, I found some pure coconut water (for twice the price as the sugar added one) at a grocery store and was eager to try it only to be let down.
5;Best Protien Suppliment Out There!;I've worked for an organic food company and this is absolutely the best protien suppliment I have ever tried.  When I couldn't get it at the local store I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon.
5;Good Product- VERY Slow Super Saver Shipping;My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them.
5;Yummy!;These are wonderful!  Made with organic sugar and all natural ingredients is a must for my family!  Even my 5 year old loves them.  They have a light hint of mint, but mostly taste like chai tea.
5;Delicious whole grain goodness;Healthy grains seem to be in the news recently and cereal bars, granola and other whole grain foods claim to be tasty and good for you.  The people at Kind have mastered both taste and health in their healthy grains product.
5;REAL fruit flavored lollipops! Feel good about giving them to your kids!;Finally, a lollipop without corn syrup, chemicals, artificial colors and flavors! Organic ingredients, fruit flavors, and natural colors are what I'm looking for. The best thing is these taste great too! Kids and adults both love these.
5;Great for snacking or for a small meal!!!;These are great!  They are spicy, but not too spicy.  They taste just like Buffalo Hot Wings but without the bones.
5;Great Healthy Snack!;These crunchy snacks are healthy, addictive, and tasty. I love the crisp texture, the flavors, and the perfect size for a snack.
5;A bit pricey.;These triple ginger snaps are wonderful.  They are amazing.
4;Delicious and affordable Grade B maple syrup;This is the second time I've purchased Coombs Family Farms Grade B Maple Syrup and when we empty this jug, I'll buy another. It's difficult to find Grade B maple syrup where I live, so having it available for purchase via Amazon is great.
5;Even non-diabetics approve!;I purchased these for my husband as he was recently diagnosed as diabetic.  I eat them as much as he does!  There is no strange after-taste as with some sugar-substitute enhanced foods.
5;Dogswell Products.....;We have a Lab/Retriever Mix that we rescued from a shelter about six years ago.<br />Baxter (the dog) developed an allergy to the food he was eating and began to lick and chew on his paws incessantly.
5;Great design;I bought two Nifty 54 Coffee Pod Drawers and am very happy with the quality and space economy these provide. I plan on buying more as my wife loves her Keurig so much and the variety it allows and as such we have quite a few pods.
4;Dogs love it!;My two yorkies LOVES this product! I've had no issues with this product except that from time to time it gets stuck inbetween their teeth or they try to swallow it whole when it's almost gone, but that can happen with any raw hide. I'm only giving it a 4 star because it does not prevent tartar build up for my dogs.
5;Hetrbal Teas,Chamomile;This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
5;Starbucks in West Africa.;I live in West Africa, where there are currently no Starbucks stores and our grocery stores do not sell Starbucks coffee. It will probably be a least 50 years, and I don't plan on being here in 50 years.
5;Good flavor;First time ordering this flavor, with excellent results.  Would recommend to others as a smooth blend.
1;Poor customer service. Dishonest vendor. Would not buy fron again.;Very dishonest vendor. Received damaged package.
4;splendid!;This is a delicate oolong with a good nose and long finish.  It's not as good as the fancy gift box I got from a friend, but pretty close.
5;Nice to get them in an area where it's hard to find them;I don't buy many pre-packaged cookies, but remember really liking these when I lived in Texas.  I decided to get some to have around, and am glad I did.
5;Great tea;I drank this tea when my baby started to sleep through the night however I could not sleep. I love the way it relaxed me.
5;Vino Italiano Wine Kit - Valpolicella;I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info.  I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella).
5;ldh;Purchased the tea bags for bridal shower favors.  I stuck on a customized sticker on the tea bags, and everyone loved it.
5;Lindy and Gracie like 'em;To properly test this product, I had to go to my experts - our dog and her walking friend.  Most mornings, after their walk with their moms, they return to our house to play in the yard.
4;Best buy in this catagory;I bake A LOT. Snickerdoodles, which require cream of tartar, (a.
5;#1 coloring set;This is #1 set of coloring to me you have so many color choice you can make from this set.I like because it is gel not liquid or powder.
5;MAGIC CAT FOOD;I have an extremely large (not fat, just huge) cat, who has major problems with digestion. Every other brand cat food he would barf up his breakfast every day.
5;Convenient & cheap if you wait for the sale price;I watch for this 48-pack of Oreos to drop below fifteen bucks to justify the convenience for the price.  With these small packs of Oreos my kiddos grab them for their lunches (1 is middle school, 1 is HS)and my husband and I also choose them for a small snack.
4;donut house cinnamon roll;The cinnamon roll coffee and flavor is mild.  I use the large size brew button on the keurig so that may have something to do with it.
5;Looks like fish food but taste is right on;My family teases me that it looks like fish food but I don't care.  I mix this with anything with a *little* sugar (honey bunches of oats, cheerios, etc) for a fiber rich breakfast.
5;A Great Tasting and Nutritious Cereal!;This is a great tasting cereal with a texture similar to Grape-Nuts but with a more full bodied flavor. I enjoy it with some almond milk and a handful of nuts or fruit for variety.
5;Great fast meal..;Nuke it for 2 min and sprinkle some cheddar or Cotija cheese. Keep a few in the desk or whatever.
4;Mild coffee but has nice, not bitter or artificial taste;Bought this for my daughter who loved flavored coffees.  This is a good one.
5;This stuff is fantastic!;I started using this product after a cycling buddy told me about it at the gym.  It helps great with muscle recovery after a hard workout.
5;YUMMY;My husband is very picky when it come to flavored coffee.  He found that this was just PERFECT.
5;Dog loves them;These are fantastic ways to get the dog to take her pills.  They work well and make life a lot easier.
5;My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago;My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.
4;Puppies love this!;My 6 mos puppy and my friend's 4 mos puppy LOVED these - they were easy enough to chew since one had mainly puppy teeth and the other had a couple adult teeth that just grew in. We were looking for something for them to chew on but wouldn't be too difficult for puppies.
4;JAW BREAKERS!!!;Bit of a Jaw Breaker Fiend, these are..
4;Good product;Great product.  Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I found it cheaper at Meijers.
5;Great stuff;I love this stuff. I had always been a major eater of salt.
5;Love this tea;Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.
2;not for indoor use;My dog loved the treat but I now have stains all over my house from the product.  I recommend that this be used only outdoors.
5;Great, guiltless taste!;I love these pita chips!  It's not greasy, too salty, or stale, which makes a great snack.  I'm going to try the other flavors and bagel chips as well.
5;Tasty and healthy salt;I've heard about Pink Himalayan Salt from Dr. Mercola pages and after that I have order it.
3;Good Concept;I bought this product (Beef Flavor) to be able to maybe give my dog her medicine more easily, but she won't eat them.  She puts it in her mouth, but then spits it right back out, licks it a little, then leaves it alone.
5;Best hot sauce;I love spicy food, and this hot sauce is the best.  It's nice and spicy, enhances the flavor of the food, adds a good amount of heat, and the flavor isn't overpowering the way Tabasco sauce.
5;The standard by which all other chocolates are compared.;Asbach Uralt the standard by which all other chocolates are compared.<br />That's what my wife says.
4;Pretty good and much better than canned;This tuna is sustainably caught and so far the only sustainably caught tuna that does not come in a can that I have seen. It tastes good and a lot better than canned tuna.
5;Very Good Coffee;I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties.
5;Great deal;I bought these to make dirt and worms for my kids and their friends.These came fresh and are very sour the ones at the supermarket are more sweet.
5;...and my dog thanks you!;Doggie biscuits are made with Barley flour.  I was finding it difficult to find.
5;I can eat bread again;After my diagnosis of celiac diseas, I pretty much just gave up on bread
4;The motto of this drink fits;I have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas. I will never buy Pepsi or Coke products.
5;Blue Mountain is the best;I have been drinking Blue Mountain Coffee off and on for the last 5 years, switching it with Kona (I am a true coffee snob..
5;Delicious combination!;I like many flavors of Tic Tacs, but these are especially good.  There are two colors in the pack, both with a different type of strawberry flavor.
3;Great Taste, Poor Packaging;I bought this item as a gift for my sister. After speaking with her a few days ago, she confirmed that the pretzels are very good and has gone through one of the bags faster than intended.
4;does the job;For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums.
1;False Advertising;I ordered the Tyson Premium Chunk White Chicken Breast and that is not what I received also received Tyson White Chicken. I thought the same attention to detail but after seeing the one review I am beginning to believe there is no Tyson Premium Chunk White Chicken Breast.
5;Good healthy dog food;I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains.
5;Premium Quality Dog Food!!!;We have been using this food for about 6 months now and find it to be just excellent! Other than the fact our two dogs (a Coton de Tulear 15lbs, and Standard Poodle puppy 40lbs) both love the food, but are thriving.  Their coats are in excellent condition and their overall structure is perfect.
5;Just what I need in the morning;Jet Fuel by Coffee People is one of my favorites. Bold.
3;OK, but pricy;It's convenient for the office and taste good, but expensive for home use.  Good value for the office and on the road, but not for home.
4;Better After a Few Bites;My first few bites were a bit chewy and dry.  I didn't enjoy it so much.
5;Great Spice Mix!;A well crafted spice mix. Not too salty
3;Oh Senseo;Senseo, I used to LOVE you, but then your products went dark for nearly 8 months, whats a gal to do without coffee?..
4;Good and convenient;This product is a great way to have a nutritious meal at work when you don't have a lot of time. It is very tasty
5;good;Excellent service, the product arrived on time and same presentation I asked for. Will count for a next purchase with them.
4;Euromild is Truly Mild;"Was delighted to be able to taste Euromild after discovering it was recommended for acid-related health issues. It is indeed ""mild"" but to be fair it is probably just a bit boring for all that!  Having been a black coffee drinker of the french roast persuasion for years until I found the acidity of regular coffee too challenging for my bladder, I was eager to find a good substitute."
5;Taste most like conventional saltines;These saltines taste wonderful. Light, crispy, lightly salty.
4;OK quinoa;This is a good price at which to buy..
2;"Tasty But Aloe Vero ""Floaties"" Put Me Off";Although I am a big tea drinker, both hot and cold, I don't normally drink green tea as I enjoy a nice black tea taste and have never bought it as a beverage. Therefore I didn't really know what to expect when I got the Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea - Passion Fruit flavor.
5;The cats love it....;I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.
4;Excellent Product, But This Is Not the Best Value;I love Bob's Red Mill products and the flaxseed meal is no exception.  I eat this nearly everyday in a hot breakfast cereal.
4;Expensive Beef Chunks;"They are astronomically expensive (check out the ""regular"" prices) but they are quality and delicious. There probably is equal to and cheaper out there but it is nice as a splurge and they are delivered to you so you don't need to go in search of good beef."
5;Great flavor;Can't describe the flavor, except to say it is good. Adds a nice subtle flavor to food, and in some cases an interesting color
4;Chocolate!;"I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite! I can eat it a whole pint at a time. The chocolate Peanut Butter is ""OK"", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste."
4;Great toy!!;I have a 1 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  She has chewed me out of house and home (literally).
5;This is Kitty Crack...the cats LOVE this stuff...;I was skeptical when a friend raved about this treat for our cats, but she was absolutely right!! They love all the flavors--we mostly use chicken, salmon & cod. Great enticement to crumble over their canned food when they think you're giving them inferior food not worthy of their little palates (even when you're feeding the good stuff!).
4;illy issimo cappuccino;Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl.
5;Love the food, hate the price.;We rescued our first dog October 30th and because I was stupid and had never had a dog, we bought back to basics turkey and started him on it right away. No transition.
5;No gas from my Boston Terriers;Boston Terriers are notorious for their gas and mine are no different.  I've fed them many different foods and this is the one food that doesn't give them gas.
5;Fresh as Ever;Not only do I hear (again) how beautiful these flowers are but that they last an amazingly long time.<br />Excellent value for money.
2;Be Careful if using these long term;I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months.  He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets.
4;Hormel Compleats;It was very nice to find these on Amazon.  I eat them for lunch everyday but can't always find the ones I like each time I shop.
5;Glad I read all the reviews!!!!!!!!  That is why I bought it.;Read several reviews about this coffee.  Let me first say it is coffee and not Espresso.
5;A Great Product!;This in just wonderful to cook with. I use it to coat my fired homemade chicken strips.
5;Dog Treats;Healthy treats for our Standard American Eskimo dog. He will do almost anything for one.
1;Unimpressed;I purchased the 3-bag pack for the holidays.  I'm not a pistachio nut aficiando but these are awful.
3;careful with the variety pack;I love Torani and buy more than I care to admit. I will stay away from the variety packs though cause there is always one flavor (raspberry for example) that I hate.
5;WOW...never thought I'd find these!;I'm old-school in the toothpick department. We'd fill old Rx bottles with cinnamon oil that we bought at the drugstore and eat them on the bus.
4;Great product - the dog doesnt like the taste;The product seems to be helping my older dog with hip and leg issues..
4;Least Stinky of These Treats;"First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really ""everlasting"" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href=""http://www."
5;40 packets!!!;I love this ramen and I am so SO happy that Amazon offers it. You get 8 five-packs shipped directly to your door.
5;Staple item in my pantry;I am a professional chef and work on mega yachts all around the world. This is one of the finest authentic Balsamics available.
5;yummy;These are really delicious cookies and they are far healthier than most of the junk in the stores.  They are full of all natural ingredients, no high fructose or additives here.
5;C'MON ITS REESES PIECES!!!!;This is candy, If your reading this youve probably already eaten reeses pieces, you know what they taste like, and if you buy this bag you must be a really big fan of them like i am, ive still got half a bag and i bought them in february/march. Soooo goooooood!! but unless your going to use them for baking or just eat candy constantly, i wouldnt recommend this big of a bag for a single human consumption.
5;Love This Tea;This tea is awesome! It's a little lighter than standard green tea, but still has all the great health benefits. Stash is a quality tea but I have trouble finding this blend of green and white tea at the store, so having it shipped to me every few months is a great way to save time and money.
5;AWESOME!;I ordered a case of these for our fourth of July party. They made it to Afghanistan in perfect shape.
5;This stuff is awesome - VERY TASTY!;I bought the Ostrim with a little apprehension never having eaten any Ostrich meat.  After I had my first bite I KNEW I would be ordering more!  This is one of the best beef sticks (ok beef and Ostrich) that I have tasted, not only that it is very low calorie and high protein (which helps you feel full longer) and is all natural.
3;Brussel's Fringe Flower Bonsai Tree;"The tree is lovely and has many branches to train and many buds, and was a good price.  The subject I want to complain about is how it was packed for shipping:  The potting dish sat in a styrofoam base which held the tree up fairly well and then the box was stuffed with ""peanuts""."
5;Great flavor - Excellent value;I buy organic when possible and have been a fan of McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal for years, but saw the reviews for Country Choice here by Amazon customers and noticed it was a winner in Cooking Illustrated ratings, and I decided to try it.  I found no discerning difference in the flavor.
4;Love this stuff!;I am very happy with this curry rice pilaf.  It's so easy to make, it's healthy, and very tasty.
5;Great Product;my dogs all love these and one has severe food allergies so these are great. I will buy these again.
5;Can't beat the taste for the price!;Half the price of starbucks/peets coffee and tastes just as good!<br /><br />I drink a ton of coffee,  use a french press and always fresh grind.  I'm always on the lookout for a good coffee that is not expensive (starbucks, etc.
5;great portion contolled snack;These are great to have around as a snack..
5;Excellent cat treats;I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love.
5;Napoleon Sour;"I was looking for a ""sour"" hard candy and these fit the bill.  They are a bit on the expensive side but worth it--in my opinion."
5;Cats love it and it works!;This stuff goes down well with my cats, and the number of hairballs is greatly reduced in the long term. Highly recommended.
1;VERY BAD and NOT RELIABLE Amazon service;The product is good, but buying it at Amazon has been a BAD experience.<br />When you buy baby formula, you need reliability of supply.
4;Caffe' Con Gusto!;My wife and I love this Italian coffee since we practically grew up with it..
5;Yogi Tea Relieve, Organic Breathe Deep, Tea Bags;Great for people with asthma! I like the taste and best of all the results. Being able to breathe freely.
1;A raspberry for Haribo Raspberries;Disappointing. Fair to good raspberry flavor with gummi chewy core, but the tiny pure sugar pellets coating (to mimic raspberry form) is sickening sweet.
5;Everlasting Dog Treats -- Love at First Bite!;"This was an instant success for our food- and treat-fussy Siberian, and our ""normal"" voracious Malamute.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Most importantly: If our siberian will accept (as in devour!) these treats, we predict most any other fussy pups will too."
3;Gum had great natural flavor;What I liked best was the flavor, both for spearmint and cinnamon. However, I discovered I had a problem digesting xylitol (as some do), so won't be purchasing additional items made with it.
5;Amazing!;If you're an instant-ramen connoisseur, this is the noodle you've been searching for. Bowl Noodle is far better than any other instant noodle I've had.
5;Great supplement that my dog asks for;My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.
5;Excellent broth for vegan and gluten-free meals, like pho;Tasty and delicious. Has good flavor without having to make veggie broth from scratch.
3;Not the Best;These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.
5;Great for Gluten Free baking;This is a very good product and the cheapest price for a pound that I've seen.  I will be getting from them every time I need some.
4;Good Nutrition, Doesn't Like The Taste Much;It's good and filling for my child but when given to him by itself he doesn't like the flavor. I usually mix it with a banana but I have recently started to buy the mixed fruit cereal which is sweet and mixing one pack of each and that seems to do the trick.
5;Byron's favorite treat;This is the best dog treat for the best price.  Totally pleased with the whole shopping experience through Amazon.
5;Great Popcorn;"This popcorn is a very refreshing change from either the dry ""healthy"" popcorn, or the over soaked ""movie butter"" popcorn.  The pepper is very nice, and can give you a nice burn by the time you're done with the bag (this is a good thing)."
5;Cereals with great ingredients;This is a delicious cereal with cinnamon, toasted almonds, and raisins. I recommend using a table spoon of sugar and a cup of milk with a cup full of cereals.
4;Prefer the rice Earth's Best over this one;We've used this cereal many times for our twins and have had no problems. It's a great brand.
5;Terrific chip!;Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now.
1;Diet Cola tastes horrible;It is hilarious to me that they say to compare to Diet Coke.  It tastes nothing like Diet Coke, and more like crap.
4;Very, very mild;I read the other reviews stating how mild this was, but I was expecting it to have some vanilla flavor. While it smells really wonderful (creamy and slightly spicy), I can only taste rooibos and chamomile when I drink it.
4;Great for Lunch Boxes;This is a small muffin mix.  The package says it will make 5 standard sized muffins
3;Just ok;I have found some of Kay's Natural food to be pretty good.  I wasn't really impressed with these chips, though.
1;TERRIBLE TASTE;I was excited about receiving decaf tea, but it tastes absolutely horrible!  I can't even drink a full cup of it, I tried making it several different ways, but it is not good at all.  Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it.
5;Italian Sausage Success;This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick.
2;Was disappointed with the anise taste.;I looked forward to this tea and I don't know why.  I was disappointed in the flavor and I have made better tea myself by adding a drop of Anise candy flavoring to green tea.
4;Long lasting;We've had this light for a year and it's still going strong.  However, buyer beware that the plastic may bubble slightly over high heat.
5;Bedtime is Greattime Now;Yogi Bedtime Tea totally crushes Celestial Seasonings' SLEEPYTIME tea.  I've tried both and the difference is amazing.
5;same food, less money;Great price, same food! Food arrived well packaged, quick, no problems. My cats like the food (it's really the same stuff) and I am glad to spend less and not have to go to the store.
5;Best trap, it's a real killer;We have gophers and they started eating my veggie gardern so it is war. My dogs know where the gophers are and will start a hole but then just watch the gophers.
5;Great coffee.;Different look but works just fine in my maker.  I love the French Roast flavor.
3;cats were not too fond of this food;They would eat some of it, but not finish it which they do if they really like the food. It is very easy to open and feed as you just squeeze the pouch.
5;Just what I was looking for;These were the only squeeze tubes I could find, but were just what I was looking for.  The only issue I have is with the clips that are supposed to keep the tubes closed.
5;My cat will eat it!;My cat will eat this.  I use it like a pill pocket as my cat will eat this but not the pill pocket.
5;The Best product for Dietary Fiber Intact;OMG, things little treasures are wonderful!!  I LOVE these bars.  I have problems with constipation and these little bars help so much.
4;Here's what the family says...;Overall, I would definitely recommend you try this one. It's a familiar flavor, but somehow different.
5;cat food subscription;excellent service. easy to sign up for subscription and mange frequency of deliveries.
4;tasty little treat;my hubby loves this candy.  There's a story how he got hooked, but thats private.
3;Good tea except for one thing...;It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.
4;tastes great;Packaged well item tastes great can be messy when you attempt to eat that clif bar falls apart. However I want more of this product.
1;YUCK!!!!;I just got this..
5;bons comme chez nous!;I love these cookies! They are just like other French cookies called Pepito. The only problem is that once you open the box you can't just have one.
1;not the same GF brownie mix;The first time I made this mix it was outstanding, to the point I doubted it was actually gluten free.  Today made mix and it was totally different in making it and had totally different taste/texture.
3;chemical candy like flavor;If this had been the first MIO I tried, I wouldn't have risked any other flavor.<br /><br />The concept is great, sugar and caffeine free, portable and an option for people who dislike plain water or who are on sugar-restricted diets.
5;Next best thing to a real Thai Coconut;I used to buy flats of fresh young Thai coconut from the local asian supermarket.  I used hack them to bits with a meat cleaver, to get at the tender flesh and the refreshing sweet water.
5;Breeder Recommended & Cavalier King Charles Puppy Loves It!;"The breeder started our puppy on a combination of this ""small bites"" Natural Balance food along with canned food of the same type and then transitioned him into just this kibble. All the puppies in the litter love the food, and their digestion seems pretty regular."
5;Our twins love it.;We have 9 month old twins and our babies love this baby gourmet juicy pear and garden greens.  That's the true test, if your baby eats it!  Ours eat it every time.
5;Fabulous and Out of this World Delicious Cookies;OMG! The first bite I had I am hooked addicted to those cookies forever. If you eat Oreo then you have this cookie, I bet you'll buy this Late July product from now on.
5;Wonderful Teas;I drink it everyday and it tastes great! Each box came packed in clear plastic and I feel secure buying it again. Good deal for the money.
5;Typo ?;Great little item..
2;Is it really cheese??;Ok, it's spam and I like spam so there's that.  Cheese? I like cheese too so I figured I should like spam with cheese!  I usually slice up the spam and put it on paper plates and paper towels and zap it for a few minutes in the microwave until the edges are crispy.
5;Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended;This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs.
3;could I be wrong;Blk cerry juice is supposed to aid in the aches and pains of joints, although not terrible tasting when mixed with water, it does taste like cough syrup. Has it helped my joint pain, too early to tell, maybe someone using this long term can testify.
3;Tasty;Great little bar. It's chewy and tangy.
5;Very good gluten free pasta;We know all about gluten free foods and this brand is the best gluten free pasta I've had so far.  It has a much better flavor and texture than just plain old brown rice pasta and the nutritional content is better too.
1;Did we get a bad batch?;My cats will eat anything - and I mean anything - probably because of the time they spent in the local shelter before I adopted them.  However, even though they will eat anything, I invest in the best food I can find.
5;Nutro Power!;Our cats have been on Nutro Natural Choice since they were two months old and are very happy. They love all things chicken so this is their favorite food.
3;OK I guess;A bit mushy (which some may like)..
5;Calories anyone?;I love Planters Mixed nuts! I gave them up because I am losing weight, and have to reduce my salt intake. Now I eat walnuts, a few at a time.
4;You can eat ginger snaps again!;These ginger snaps aren't too overpowering on the ginger and go great with some milk. Really enjoyed having these in the house and they are a great buy - so affordable compared to most alternative diet foods.
5;Perfection!!!;Absolute perfection in a chip!  You will not believe it until you taste it..
5;We use this all the time to make dessert.;We use this all the time to make dessert.  We double the amount of water to make a jello like consistency and pour some caramel syrup on it.
5;Prince of Peace Organic Green Tea:  fresh, light-tasting, & no bitterness;I drink a lot of green tea, iced.  I use a Mr.
5;Bernard Jensen Geletin;This is the gelatin that is recommended in the WAPF Wise Traditions 2011 Shopping Guide.<br /><br />I ordered my first bottle of it a month or two ago, and have used it several times to up the nutritional content of homemade broths and soups.
5;Repeat Customer;This is my second order. I think I will reorder every 3 months now.
5;Addictive;Found these in a cupboard in a vacation rental.  Thought i would just nibble on a few and the owners wouldnt notice.
5;A childhood favorite!;A cereal that is difficult to find and of course Amazon had it! A favorite of my husband's while growing up..
5;Love it!;I haven't ordered this online, but I just wanted to say how much I LOVE this tea. I usually get the cardamom or the marsala chai, but I also have a soft spot for the ginger.
4;Tasty, filing and healthy!;"Even though I love the taste of zone bars and the like, they are not made with very good ingredients.  This is a ""whole food"" snack bar--the mix of macadamias and almonds is heavenly!  Cranberries add a great tartness."
5;Product and Service - Great!;I'm outside of CONUS and can't get this locally. A buddy brought it over for me.
5;Dental Chews;Our dogs love these chews. We give them each one a day.
3;"ok, larger crystals than ""normal""";I use this for tea at the office. I think raw sugar tastes better than bleached and this just ok.
5;Dark Chocolate & Ginger;Two of my favorite things, extra special together. The product itself is delicious and I love this shortbread combination.
5;gummi letters;the haribo gummi letters are great.exactly the way gummi candy should be,nice and chewy.
5;dang good;smooth cuz its steam roasted. grab this instead of crappy starbucks.
5;Wonderful apple and cinnamon flavored curd........;I am not big on apple flavored food, but this is an exception.  This curd has a wonderful fresh taste.
5;Udis hot dog rolls;For the first time in 7 years I could enjoy a hot dog in a bun.  Udis Hot Dog Rolls are the best gluten free rolls I have ever tasted.
1;Vita Coco Buyers BEWARE- Mold inside;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand."
5;For your Health;This product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys.  It has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure.
5;Love it.;I drink this tea everynight before I go to bed and it helps to relax me and get the troubles of the day off of my mind.  The flavor and aroma are awesome as well.
5;What a great value!;"Purchasing this product through Amazon is such a great value when compared to my local food stores like Publix. Publix has a section called ""GreenWise"" which does carry this product, but the overall value buying through here makes the difference."
5;Bentley's Tea;"I love this tea! It might be a bit more expensive than some other brands but I think it's worth it.  It has a light flavor and not the strong ""tea taste"" that some of the other brands have."
5;great!;These are some of my favorite bars and are not too sweet and don't melt in the heat.  I throw a few of these in my backpack and they're great anytime i need a quick snack.
4;Great little chip;Bought these to try with our new eating life style and they have proven to be a great little addition. The flavor is super, the blue corn is a favorite and brings its own unique flavor to our dishes.
5;Yum;My on love them.  Try are generous in size and good or him.
5;The Cat's Meow;My cat loves this food.  Admittedly I've never given him anything else for dinner but he's finicky about treats.
5;Great Gift Idea, Fast Shipping;I've ordered about three different fruit gifts for various people since December. Each recipient has expressed to me that the product is quite good.
5;two thumbs way up from our golden retriever, Sammie!;Sammie is what you would call a discriminating eater
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
4;Worth trying if your cat has problems with their current food.;I've been feeding my cat this food for about 7 months without any problems.<br />I mainly tried it because she was throwing up a lot with her previous Purina cat food.
1;Poor Shelf Life!;Don't buy these for your BoB. I just got mine and they expire in July.
5;Excellent Product;I use McCann steel cut Oat Meal as a soaker for natural artisan sourdough breads (Maple Oatmeal Bread) and it adds terrific flavor and texture to the loaves.  The product also makes a great breakfast cereal.
4;Don't Be Afraid to Try It;OMG. I am SO relieved.
5;Kind Bar!;These bars are delicious!!!  I've always been a sucker for coconut and almond so I figured this flavor of Kind Bars would be right up my alley.  I was right.
5;Good stuff;This was EXACTLY what I was looking for, and EXACTLY as advertised. Not stale, obviously hadn't been on a shelf forever.
1;Nice Aroma, Bitter Taste;The hazelnut aroma from this cup of coffee was really nice, but all I could taste was bitterness.  If you don't like bitter coffee this selection is probably not for you.
5;Yum and convenient!;We're not coffee snobs but we like what we like..
3;Not as sweet as other French Vanilla coffees;I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.
5;Great for a sore throat;My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.
5;SToK shots;Really like these. I don't use them everyday, but they are nice to have for certain mornings when I have to wake up for work but went to bed far later than I should have the night before.
5;Haribo Raspberries;What can I say..
1;Disappointing coffee!;"I had previously purchased a 2 pound bag of this brand of medium roast and thought it was too weak.  But this dark roast is also disappointing and in general this ""Community Coffee""  is just not very good coffee and is really not that great a bargain."
5;My puppy LOVES these;These are awesome. My puppy loves them and I love that they made his breath smell better.
5;Great!;Love this chocolate!  It is the best I have had and the flavors are unusal and wonderful.  I will definitely buy again.
5;M&M 12.6oz;This is a great products, kids love it.  Good for cooking!  If you buy them in the store they will cost you quite abit more for a single pack.
5;Great For Ice-Blended Espresso!;I was looking for a frozen beverage base to thicken and help flavor my ice-blended espresso drinks, and Frozen Explosion fits the bill. It enhances coffee flavor so well that I even use it in hot coffee as a creamer/sweetener instead of milk and sugar.
5;Tasty Reduced-Fat;This is the first Redued-Fat Peanut Butter that I have thought was a good peanut butter.  I will buy it again when this is gone.
5;These are nuts!;Pleased with these nuts. Went through them fast and even shared some with friends.
5;Delicious and good for you....;I have always been a huge fan of rice vermicelli, in Asian foods. The only setback is that most rice vermicelli is made from processed, refined flour.
4;Best ever when made with buttermilk;LOve these pancakes when made as suggested. Have made them with buttermilk powder & skim milk -- passable, but not the best.
5;I love this stuff.;I tried Dandy Blend after regular coffee started to hurt my stomach.  I loved it right away.
5;Healthy AND tasty;I originally got these because I thought I wouldn't want to eat as many while trying to lose weight.  I have come to love these unsalted pretzels.
3;Disappointed;There was a hole in the bottom of one of the bags so the entire box was full of chocolate dust. Very frustrating.
5;fat freehot coca mix;I've been buying Nestle's fat free hot coca for years. When my market no longer carried it, someone suggested I try amazon.
5;Don't buy these if you don't alredy know you like them!!;These are my favorite candy of all time. HOWEVER.
1;Very Disappointed;I always hate to write a bad review, but here goes.<br /><br />I don't know how these tomatoes taste.
5;Great Deal!;"I love this stuff!  I'm hooked now,  I'm going to have to get a cappuccinno maker soon!  I got the ""Mocha"" flavor and it's awesome!  I'm not a big ""coffee"" drinker and hot chocolate usually gives me the loose badoodles IYKWIM! lol.."
1;The Expiration Has Not Come, But ...;I love this flavor of International Delight and my grocery store has discontinued it in this single use product.  I was so happy to find it at Amazon, but althought the expiration date is February 2009, most of the containers are sour and not fit to use.
5;The greatest thing EVER;So my cat is very skittish and even though she is comfortable with me holding her head, I simply could not get her to take her pills. It was very upsetting for both of us: she'd start foaming from the pill residue after she spit it out and then run under the bed
5;Spicy and flavorful;This is a great product. It comes in a nice selection with all levels of extreme heat represented.
4;Good stuff but a little too expensive;I have not tried the plain one but the berry one taste very good. I found them on sale at Kroger's and bought 6 bottles.
5;Fabulous Postal and Food Scale;Good price, product works as advertised and is better than most postal scales.  Can weigh my food as well up to 55 lbs.
5;It's a 100% HIT!!!;This food looks and smells DELICIOUS, even to mom's vegetarian nose! Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was.
1;moldy;"I purchased a 6 pack of Conchita Guava Preserve and the third one that I opened was moldy. They are dated ""best by Oct 2012""Today is 7/14/12."
5;Yummy;I ordered these jelly beans for my wedding to use as part of the candy favors. I was trying to find a jelly bean that was somewhat healthy and eco-friendly.
5;Excellent for the office;The lifesavers arrived in a timely fashion and were just as the ad described. Delicious, individually wrapped, wint-o-mint candies.
5;Winner!;My furry little friend, who happens not to enjoy eating and who has turned down many cat food brands, LOVES Spots Stew chicken.<br /><br />The consistency and texture are soft and fluffy, much like mousse.
3;Best organic formula, too bad about constipation;This is by far, the best formula out there. The fact that is uses brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup is a major plus in my book.
2;Small  8oz jar and no special taste;I bought two jars of this blood orange marmalade based on the great review. However, this marmalade does tast great and in fact, is not one of the better blood orange marmalades on the market.
5;Yummy and fast shipping;I bought this for a bridal shower and it came in two days!  The jelly beans are just like what you would get in a store and there are about 400 of them.  Definitely buy if you want strawberry cheesecake jelly beans.
5;Awesome;I absolutely love the taste of this jerky. Arrived very quick within 4 days and I received a sample of teriyaki jerky.
1;Terrible: Walden Farms Ranch Dressing;This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.
2;big chunks;I am a fairly new matcha tea drinker and this is only my second purchase so I do not know if this is normal or not. This is not ground very fine it has big chunks of leaves in it.
3;Nice Aroma, Off Taste;The aroma while brewing was great, but the actual drink felt watered down. I recommend using the 2nd smallest brewing size on a Keurig Platinum - the taste was still a little off, but decent.
5;dogs love them!!;These are a wonderful treat for any dog.  Basically a peanut butter OREO for dogs.
4;Delicious, says my cat;
5;Best gluten free pasta;"This is the best gluten free pasta I have purchased.  It tastes much better than the rice based gluten free I have tried and better than the ""real"" wheat pastas."
4;Love the coconut!;I really enjoy the flavor of the coconut in this coffee. I like Jamaica Me Crazy as well, but I think this one is a little better.
5;Green Tea with Honey & Lemon;Those who like this product should write to Lipton asking them to keep making this product. Haven't found another product as good yet.
5;Delicious low fat treat.;Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.
1;A Snack not worth the swelling;I had a handful of these crackers last night - and though they are tasty, my hands, face, and ankles swelled to a ridiculous size.  I wasn't sure if it was the crackers or something else I ate - so I ate them by themselves at lunch - and again, I am a swollen mess.
4;Great quality and price;My office has a keruig machine, but after a few months our budget was starting to strain with the cost of the k-cups. Many of us who really prefer a good cuppa in the morning (or noon, or night) often buy our own supply now.
5;Wonderful!;I just had to write a review for the Greenies Pill Pockets.  Genius!  My older dog has to take 3 pills, 3x/day.
1;Had a burned taste;I probably would have liked these very much except they are very brown and have a burned flavor.  Apparently since the other reviews were good, they have a problem with quality control.
2;These are okay, but you can do better for your cat & wallet;We have two cats who are addicted to treats.<br />Okay, we made them that way.
2;Phail.;I love The regular Peanut Butter powder and was very excited to see this new product available. Unfortunately, these cookies had a very strong ammonia taste to them.
4;"Fairly tasty...not as ""pumpkin-y"" as I was hoping";I love this time of year..
5;Simply Delicious to eat;If you are on a diet or simply want something that tastes great without eating all that sugar that is on regular chocolates then this is a great product for you.  Tastes great as long as you don't finish the whole box in a day.
4;yummy!;these are great for my joints!  I eat like five a day, hack up half on the white carpet and the rest sure make me feel gooooooooooooood.  if they had catnip ones i would be all over dat!  - but the vet says i gots to lay off the nip a bit.
5;great product from a great company;great purchase and a great value from a wonderful company who stands behind their product.<br />Had four of the trays for about five months, and they were in CONSTANT use.
5;Great Taste and Value;I have tried several other brands of soba noodles from Amazon. So far, Eden Organic Soba and Roland Organic Soba are the best ones I have tried so far.
4;Finally!;I've asked for this flavor in three local groceries..
5;Big flavor.  No calories.;Terrific, bold licorice flavor in a small, no calorie package.  These aren't intended to be eaten by the handful.
1;My dog choked on the Edible Bone;Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.
5;Olave Olive Oil;This is a very fine olive oil with a pleasent green, young, fresh smell.  Olave has been chosen as one of the best olive oils in the world but few people know about it so it is possible to get it at a good price.
5;Holy crow! This sh*t is HOT!! (which is a good thing);I bought a bottle of Dave's Insanity twelve years ago at a hot sauce store in Boulder, CO, back when Dave's was the hottest sauce made. One or two drops in a pot of soup made the whole thing damn near unbearable (yet my roommate managed to use half the bottle in around 2 months).
5;Excellent Coffee;I've been drinking this coffee every morning for the last two weeks and I like it very much. I enjoy the flavor, the aroma and the aftertaste.
5;Best K-Cup I've had so far;My fiance bought me a Keurig last Christmas and I have been trying many different brands.  This one is my favorite and the first one I've decided to re-order.
5;smooth!;I'm no coffee expert but since purchasing our Keurig, I've been trying lots of different kinds of coffees to find an everyday, dependable coffee that tastes great.  Newman's Own is bold without being too bold (I didn't care for the French roasts--too strong for me) and has that restaurant-brewed flavor that's so hard to find.
5;Best facial product;This has turned out to be one of the best facial products I have ever used.<br />I have bought some products for a much higher price that did not work as well.
5;Great Variety!!;I really liked the idea of not knowing what flavors I would be getting almost like a treasure hunt. I was happy with all the flavors I received.
5;nice vanilla aroma;My mother in law loves this coffee. I find the aroma a little strong for my taste, but different people enjoy different things.
5;An Earl Grey Tea for Earl Grey Tea Lovers!;*****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea.
2;Coffee for tea drinkers...;As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up.
1;Tough and Stale;Even though the granola bars were months from expiring they seem stale. I wonder if they were stored in an over-heated warehouse.
4;Fruitilicous;After reading the ingredients on a can of diet soda, I decided to cut way, way back on my consumption.  But sometimes drinking plain seltzer water, regualr water and unsweetened tea can be a bit boring.
5;Great product at a great price.;I've been very happy with the results of this yeast. It's been my yeast of choice for several batches of cider and mead, and it has more than done its job! I love that you get 10 packages for such a low price.
5;Great crunchy sweet treat;These cookies are great!  They have a slight Tapioca flour taste, but I'm very sensitive to that.  The chocolate chip ones are even better.
2;Did not like the taste ... strong with a bitter bite.;I did not like the taste of this canned coffee.  It had a very strong, bitter bite.
4;Mango & pineapple are nice, but delicioso on ice;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:38 Mins<br /><br /></span>The secret to raising Lipton's Mango Pineapple from a 3-star, ho-hum iced tea mix to a delicioso alternative to plain water is serve this Iced Green Tea over finely crushed ice or increase the amount of water used in preparation from 16.9 fl oz to 20 fl oz."
1;Deceptive pricing tactic;This isn't the only vendor who does this, and is only singled out because I thought this was a great deal!  19-cents? Terrific..
3;don't find the cost savings;I'm not sure what most of you pay for your sodas, but here they run around 85 cents a liter plus deposit of .05.
5;My Son's Favorite Cereal !;"My ten year old son eats ""Gluten Free"". This is by far his all time favorite! He has it with Almond Milk."
5;Surprisingly Good;I tried both the Tom Yum and the Kim Chee soups and they both are so good!  The Tom Yum is a bit pungent (whatever is in the salt has quite a smell to it) but it mixes in beautifully.  I could see the flavoring might not be for everyone, though.
5;Very satisfied.;After reading the previous review I was a little wary about ordering this, but I never had this flavor and wanted to try it. The order is fulfilled by Amazon and is shipped free  with Super Saver Shipping, so I figured it should be fine.
5;Excellent quality;I use lots of bay leaves when cooking and find many brands lack the bright pungency that adds a special touch to a dish.  These have a nice bright green color.
5;Wine at its best for the Best Price at Amazon;I have purchased different wine kits from Amazon.com and I have had success in everyone I made up.
4;Wasn't that difficult to install and keeps the rabbits out of our garden;I'm pretty happy with this fence. It's your basic above-ground electric fence, nothing fancy at all, but fine for what I need it for.
4;M&M's in 'My Color' choice;These are just basic M&M's so if you go to the store and look at the bags by the register, you are getting the same product. This just happens to be about 4 times the size for about 8 times the price.
5;Santa Fe Posole Dinner Kit;Bored with our diet, we decided to try the Santa Fe Posole Dinner Kits. WOW! Delicious and simple to prepare:<br />Soak the corn overnight in a Dutch Oven pot.
5;3mo later and your winner is....CAFE ALTURA!;I've tried just about every regular/city/urban roast on Amazon and a few sought after local roasters as well (the coffee holy land - Seattle)..
5;Nutiva Coconut OIl;I have nothing but great things to say for this oil. I use it in two ways, for cooking (it adds a slight coconut essence) and for my hair.
5;Fast, convenient meal;If you need to eat and don't have much time, this is the product for you. Tastes just like the regular canned version yet is ready to eat in less than two minutes.
5;Drink your vegetables with less sodium;It seems like everything these days is loaded with sodium, and way too much of it.  Thankfully, a few years ago a low sodium version of V8 vegetable juice was introduced.
5;A little too lite for my taste;Well let me say what I like, English Breakfast tea, High Mountain Oolong. This tea didn't have enough taste.
4;Don't eat a whole one;One of the only things my mini poodle gets to eat. They don't bother him has long it is in moderation, if he is allowed a whole one it will give him the runs.
3;Actual product is great, but ordering it from Amazon isn't.;I originally ordered erythritol directly from Emerald Forest and have fallen in love with it. For those familiar with xylitol, this is better in almost every way.
5;THE BEST POP ROCKS EVER;POP ROCKS 36 packs Strawberry Sold by candymachines/<br />Penguinmints Thru Amazon, & Free Super Saving Shipping..
5;Wow, I'm impressed even though I don't normally like Timothy's coffees;I picked up a box of this to have around the house for holiday guests. I don't normally like Timothy's coffees, especially their flavored blends because they tend to lack flavor and depth.
4;A bit too sweet;The concept is great. My concern is how sugary they are.
5;Delicious;This is  a really nice coffee that I have come to love.  I have it every morning and it starts my day off happy.
5;I love pop chips;Yhese are awesome. I love the BBQ, my kids love the cheddar.
2;Overpriced:  Make your own mixes at home;This box of mixes is overpriced.  I just bought the same item at Toys R Us for $12.
3;Cat Treat;My cat is not Morris and generally eats the treats we give him.  However, he did not take a liking to these.
5;die nuss ist los;Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida.
4;Good munch to crunch;KIND makes a good variety of these raw food bars. The Almond, Walnut, and Macadamia are very good and can be addictive.
5;This stuff is the crack of salad dressings.;Seriously, this stuff is addictive.  My family argues when it runs out, the same way we would over who finished the last of the milk.
4;Pretty good coffee;This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it.
1;HORRIBLE!! BEWARE! Going OUT OF BUSINESS;HORRIBLE company with HORRIBLE customer service!!!  Hey everyone be careful when ordering from this company!! Where to begin..
5;They really help;My dog loves these treats. He waits for them every night.
5;Love!;I have ordered these chips twice and both times they were delivered in a timely manner and were fresh and delicious.  They are salted perfectly and a great substitute for anyone craving salted banana chips.
3;Meh...;The Buffalo Bleu flavor isn't that great, at least to me.  It is a sort of barbeque flavor with a hint of tang.
1;awful after taste;I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle.
5;Great Heart Healthy Supplement;Great source of omega 3's and fiber.  I take it mixed in water, but it can be added to most hot or cold foods.
1;Do not buy these';After giving my dog one of the bones she became very sick and threw up for an hour later that night. And continued to dry heave for 20-30 mins after that.
5;Lapacho tea tastes great.;I like the taste of this tea. It is supposed to be helpful with a variety of health issues.
4;The chip with a kiss of salt;These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet.
3;Meh...;For the price, I was expecting something more than an average experience. Unfortunately, the product just didn't deliver that.
5;waffle mix;great taste just like I expected.  I have a waffle a day and the 12 year old daughter loves making and eating her own for breakfast.
5;We love this coffee;This is our favorite coffee, we use it every day.  It is very rich tasting and smooth.
5;Great tasting coffee;I like the taste of this coffee. Tried the other brands but got stuck on this one, I also like the ECO friendliness of the company.
4;Simple, Flavorful, Satiating;These satiate my need for either a quick breakfast or something to eat in the afternoon for a snack when I need something I can carry in my purse. I've tried the lemon and the apple pie.
5;yummy!!!;This product is delicious. Its fast and easy to cook.
1;HORRIBLE;I just wasted money on flavorless air.  Actually, they were disgusting and flavorless.
5;Necta Sweet Sugar Substitute Tablets;I like it. It is delicious to use in many different things.
3;No corn syrup or hydrogenated oil!;"I would say ""chewy gooey"" is taking it a little too far but the cookies are soft. I prefer them over the regular hard Chips Ahoy from my childhood."
5;Awesome;This ginger ale is extrememly good.  Nice and crisp, real ginger bite.
1;2nd time ordering this item, 1st time much better product;The 1st time I ordered Hibiscus Tea it was great.  The 2nd time I have to use double the tea to get the same strength.
4;A comparison;"I've been given the opportunity to review four different Clear products. The first, <a href=""http://www."
5;Great candy substitute;I first bought these because I wanted a replacement for the candy bars I found myself eating every afternoon. These have worked so well for that purpose that I have subscribed to get them delivered regularly.
5;Really, quite good...;"I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of flavor and quality of this essentially ""instant"" hot cereal.  I often make their steel cut oats, but it takes an hour to prepare--this was quick and full of flavor with great texture."
5;I bought the quick cooking;for my mother. I use the regular steel cut oats, but mom just didn't like the idea of a cereal that would take about 30 minutes to cook.
1;Positively Disgusting Coffee....;I have nothing nice to say about this coffee.  It was just awful.
3;I do not like the taste.;I did try many different Yogi Tea and this one has terrible taste. Even adding fresh mint or slice of lemon does not help.
3;Weak, tho tasty;I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark.
5;Great!;I had no problems with this. It grows extremely fast! I had to fight with my cats just to keep them out of it while it was still growing.
1;Funky taste to these buggers;Thought I give the dried Cherry and Blueberry a try after really enjoying the dried Cranberries. I'm just not impressed with taste or consistency of the blueberry.
5;Feline Greenies Variety Pack;Our two cats are 4.5 and 7.
4;Earthy protein;This is the first time time that I've tried Hemp protein and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd read many of the comments of how bad it tasted and the consistency, etc.
4;Good Nuts, Well Roasted but too many duds.;"These Marcona almonds were well roasted and generally tasty. My only criticism would be the relatively high number of ""duds"" - the oddball nuts that are bad and taste very bitter."
5;One of my favorite bars;Their banana bread bar is definitely one of the tastier bars in the market for those who like the taste of bananas..
5;Very Nice;I like having this little bottle in my pantry. I was dubious when I first purchased it at a fancy grocery store, but a little bit has gone a long way.
5;Fiber One + Activia;Diverticuli and lactose intolerance resulted in this cocktail:<br /><br />1 cup Fiber One = 28g fiber( I call them rabbit turds)<br />1 cup serving of Activia Yogurt<br /><br />Stir both until all Fiber One is coated evenly in whatever random flavor Activia yogurt you happened to grab today. Shovel it in.
4;Smooth & East to Drink;I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I prefer a robust and gritty coffee.  This was a light and smooth flavored coffee.
5;Tasty.;"You don't have to use the ""beer can"" method.  This seasoning is great in many ways to cook chicken."
5;Iced Tea Peach;I love this Crystal Light ICED TEA PEACH but can no longer find it in my grocery stores. So the other day I ordered it online and maybe because they were out they sent a substitute.
3;Fizzie's are back;Brought back wonderful memories, however, had forgotten that I didn't enjoy the root beer ones then and don't care for them now. I love the lemon ones.
5;Makes you want to sing!;"This tastes like I remember coffee tasting and has a wonderful aroma.  It comes in a box of 25 single serve pods that you just drop in your cup (the pods are marked with ""this side down"") and add hot water."
3;Fair to Middlin';The price of coffee keeps going up, so in an effort to continue drinking coffee, I switched from the<br />stronger variety Dark Roast to this.  It's just as goood, except that you have to use 2 pods instead of one.
5;Wow!;Very tasty. Not too sweet.
5;Best we've tried!  Highly recommend!;This is the best tasting popcorn we've found for our stand popcorn popper.  We've tried a few others and this tastes the closest to movie theater type.
4;Movie theatre popcorn from the microwave at home!;"I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted ""movie theater"" or ""carnival/fair"" popcorn."
4;Love the scent.;The quality of these bags are great.  They are strong, large and have a refreshing scent.
5;Great little treats;"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as ""to go"" packs of honey for our coffee and tea."
4;Calm;Product was as promised. I found that it lessened the cramping I was getting.
5;Addictive!;"Wasn't sure how these would taste - after an initial ""hmm, interesting"" my mouth said ""yummy"".  The rest is history."
1;French Vanilla Cafe's new Maxwell House Blend;"I agree that the new French Vanilla Cafe's new Maxwell House Blend is not as good as the original.  I don't know if you have changed your recipe, but I use to drink it and feel ""ummm""."
5;Refuting the 2-Star Review.;Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review).
5;End GM Forests!;"Unlike most ""Factory Farmed"" maple forests, the forests that Coombs Family Farms use are 100% natural forests. I don't mind paying extra knowing that these trees weren't injected with any growth hormones, grown in high-density sapling nurseries or treated with any petro-chemicals, unlike most Vermont ""Forests,"" where regular, non-organic maple syrup comes from."
4;Easy to make vegan products except of Allergens;This is a nice product. I was going to try this at home and I am glad I did.
4;Helps me get my veggies.;This is a good way I've found to help add a little flavor to the veggies that I'm supposed to be getting every day.  It's pretty low in calories and tastes very good.
5;cast iron pot smokey and chile oil hot;The taste is different. Imagine you poured traditional oriental hot oil into a cast iron frying pan and overheated it:  The result is a smokey component to spicey hot oil.
5;Good and tasty;Excellent breakfast alternative and meets low sugar expectation.  Not sure why this product is not widely available in stores.
3;Greasy;This is the first oil I have used, so it's hard to have anything to compare it to.  I put it on my hair while it was wet and went to bed.
5;Drink healthy and stay healthy;This is a great product. The only pasteurized coconut water we could find and best is it taste great.
1;Hm, so so;Hard to get the timing for these right, and plus they have a funny smell. I am not buying them anymore.
5;Such a hit with my senior dog, I decided to add it to my amazon subscriptions;My 13 yr old lab developed gastro issues over the last 6 months, so I've had to become very picky about his treats. I received a bag of Newman's Own through amazon's vine review program.
5;Great for rewarding your cat;We have 4 cats and have looked for a long time for a healthy treat that they all like. We use this to reward the cats and it works great.
4;Simply Delicious;I received one of these Quaker Soft Baked Cookies in my Influenster Mom Voxbox I was hesitant to eat it as it was 170 calories their are lower calorie alternative snacks out there and cookies but this is as close to homemade as you get i liked that its soft baked and breaks apart easily the overall taste was pretty good as well. Not a purchase for me unless they were to cut about 50 calories from it.
4;Kids love them!;These cookies taste great, my kids love them! I feel good about giving them a healthier snack. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it.
5;Same as any other ketchup;No appreciable difference from any other ketchup you would find on the store shelf. This is ketchup in all its glory.
5;We could eat by the bushel;My daughter who is not a fruit eater loves this brand of dried fruit. She likes the low sugar.
5;tasty filling soup;I like this soup a lot.  It's filling and tasty and at 200 cal it can't be beat.
1;Not as good as true San Marzano tomatoes;The tomatoes pictured clearly state San Marzano, however, the actual cans when received do not mention that the tomatoes come from the region and only specify coming from Italy.  After speaking with customer service, I was assured that the replacement case would be the San Marzano type.
5;Fluffy Popcorn;I love this popcorn.  It really does pop up nice and light and fluffy compared to the ones I've bought in the store.
5;Hot stuff;I love Sriracha and did not know where to purchase it.  I am thrilled with receiving this large (28Oz.
4;Don't fear the No Fear!;This was really good. I don't like soft drinks that are too sweet and my son (16) does.
1;Nasty, don't be swayed by the 5-star reviews;"I have a feeling that Coca Cola is paying people to write 5-star reviews on their ""new"" Zico acquisition. The fact of the matter is that I have been drinking coconut water for over a year now, from Vita Coco, O."
5;Delicious and popular with guests!;This tea has been very popular with guests.  Some guests even specifically ask for it!  The minty addition to the green tea makes for a wonderful drink all year round.
5;Coffee Pod Drawer;A quality product that is a wonderful addition.  It holds the Keurig brewer nicely as well as our assortment of K-Cups.
3;not correc size;This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.
5;Mustard Bath will make you sleepy;Normally I assume that any bath product, other than epsom salt, which claims to be soothing and relaxing is just going to smell good and not be useful. The mustard bath exceeded my expecations.
4;stargazer;This is a very good tasting coffee for being half-caf. I like this because I have to watch caffine because of my stomach.
1;Made Me Sick To My Stomach!;I do not understand how anyone with actual working tastebuds can stomach this drink. I could barely swallow it without gagging.
5;A truly amazing gluten free flour mix;This is THE best gluten free flour mix that my wife and I have ever seen (and tasted). My wife makes some amazing muffins and cakes with this flour following the simple recipes on the back of the bag.
3;Dented Cans;I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery - but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented. I didn't bother with asking for replacement - we had an immediate use for the product (made lots of pumpkin pie), so this is a word of caution to other buyers.
5;these brought hours of sheer glee!!!;My Mother who was bedridden but loved this kind of candy truly got a tear in her eye when this arrived!!!  16 oz. of utter happiness.
5;Very different from other Erin Baker Breakfast cookie flavors;Let me start with:  this is one of my favorite flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast cookies.  That said, my daughter disagrees with me 100%.
5;Coco's Favorite!;These Dog Treats are the absolute favorite of my Shih Tzu, Coco.  She looks at me with her big brown eyes, pouring on the guilt until I go to the cupboard and get her some Peanut Butter Madness Buddy Biscuits.
1;Don't Buy this!;We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig, typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.
5;Excellent Salmon and Sweet Potato Dog food;
5;My 1st choice in raisin bran for 60 years;"The wisdom in the old saying, ""compare apples to apples.."
5;Best Earl Grey;I love this tea.  IMO the best Earl Grey made.
5;grains;I hadn't used millet before - I used it in soups as a thickner.  It doesn't taste to much so takes on the taste of whatever you put it in.
1;Not what expected;This shipment was not as expected.  Yes, there were 24 k-cups.
2;Not pineapples;I generally like Dole fruit products but these were off flavored.  I couldn't identify the flavor but I would never purchase them again they didn't taste anything like pineapples.
1;The BAKED version of these chips is misleading and non-tasty;Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits.
4;Yummy!;"These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Golightly Sugar Free Cinnamon Flavor;I have tried lots of Golightly no sugar flavors.  Although I like several of the flavors, this one is by far the best.
5;Cherry-licious!!;These cherries are great. Plumper than a raisin and nice for snacking.
2;Overprocessed Salt;If there is no wholesome food available, this could do.  However, this is high in salt, low in fiber, high in carbohydrates (tastes like sweet candy), and uses highly processed ground turkey.
5;Unusual and delicious;These don't taste like walnuts at all.  They are the whole shell, picked while still soft and green.
5;DELICIOUS!  These are wonderful!;I love Kit Kat bars.  Always have!  They taste delicious and they have, as another poster wrote, just the right amount of crunch!  Yum yum!<br /><br />These little bars are addictive, as I can attest.
5;Excellent Coffee at a Great Price!;This is a rich, full-bodied coffee. I drink at least a pot a day and I have yet to get a nasty acid kick-back.
4;Good calorie value!;First things first, I was struck by how hard and thin these cookies are. They don't look appealing at all, but somehow got eaten REALLY fast.
5;Great product!!;I bought the Beaba freezer trays along with the Beaba Babycook. Initially I thought why on earth did I spent that money?? However, after making baby food for three months, I can say it was totally worth it.
5;Best Cereal for healthy eating but with a sweet taste;Love this cereal. It came fast in the mail and it is way cheaper then getting it at the store which for some reason makes it taste that much better.
4;Very Strong Ginger Taste with Lemon Undertones;This product is very easy to make. I just popped some water in the microwave for 2 minutes til it was hot, open up the packet, dropped all the crystals in, and stirred.
5;Another satisfied pet owner;We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams.  Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.
5;Better the a Kong;As a triple crown graduate i can say without a doubt this is one of the best interactive toys ever! Some of the top dog trainers and behaviorist in America designed this chew. Its simply the best bang and most fun your dog can have for your buck! not much else to say wish more stores would start caring star mark products.
5;The best Hazelnut out there!;We have tried all of the Hazelnut flavored coffee brands.  This is by far the best.
5;Nutiva Coconut Oil Organic;I actually use this on my skin and have been doing so for over two years. It is a terrific moisturizer that leaves your skin especially smooth, with a lovely fresh smell as well.
4;EVEN IF YOU'RE TIRED OF POMAGRANATE EVERYTHING,  TRY THIS;I'm an adult, I 've never lost my taste for junkfood, but I do try to upgrade the junkfood I eat. Though I am already bored with pomegrantate flavored everything, I gave this a try as I have liked other Newman's Own Organics products.
1;Fish tea;I know nettle tea has a pretty distinct taste, but this particular brand was just unbearable. The smell reminded me of fish food pellets, and it had a fishy taste, too.
1;Stale;I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this.
5;Richard Thomas;We switched to tea sometime back.We brew a pot in the morning and if anything is left over my wife has it as ice tea later in the day,so we waste nothing.
5;gingerAZ;This product is very good to take with Oxy-Powder.  It cuts down on the amount of Oxy-Powder one needs and this is very good for ones budget.
5;Love These and Will Happily Order Them Again!;I bought these in bulk to make vegan burritos for Occupy Philly. They are wonderful, basic flour tortillas.
5;Much better deal than in the grocery store;Other reviewers mentioned some club based big box stores had it cheaper, but this is way cheaper than any regular grocer.  Red Star is quality.
1;Horrid after-taste;Horrible aftertaste! Perhaps I added too much (4 packs) but it was absolutely not edible. I couldn't even drink my morning coffee when I added this.
5;hershey's Cocoa Special Dark;Not sweet at all.  a little bit bitter but it does the job done when I mix with Protein shake.
4;Not a bad candy;This candy tasted good. A real honey flavor.
5;Dogs love it;My Boxers had HORRIBLE gas while on Science Diet & Royal Canin Boxer Formula. I switched to Wellness CORE & now there is no more gas.
5;Nice little enhancer;I will reorder.Nice little addition to go along with my unwinding routine.
3;Tasty, but a bit too much splenda for my taste.;These Lipton To Go Stix are small packets of powder which you mix with water to make a green tea beverage.  I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.
5;Delicious!;Core Power makes some great tasting drinks. I think the Strawberry Banana is particularly delicious, especially served chilled! The drinks are not a good $ value for me though.
5;Organic bliss;I read that tea is the only consumable that is not washed before it is packaged, so it is all the more important that it be organic. This tea is organic, and whole tea, so you get the best buds, not the leftover scraps that often go into teabags, and it tastes like it.
5;Not too soft, not too sweet...just right;I really love these new & very different cookies.  They are crisp yet chewy, not extremely sweet like most cookies.
5;BOLD coffee like it should be!;Emeril's is the only k-cup that makes coffee taste strong and good..
5;Great for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs;I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.
2;Not a bold coffee;This product is not bold in flavor at all. The package is different than what was pictured on the website.
5;Great stuff;Used to love the Irish Cream International coffee. They stopped selling it.
5;Very Good!;Great texture and balance of sweet to butter is just about right. Adults and kids both love them.
5;recevied items much earlier than imagined;Just wait 3 days and I got the items from UPS. Very quickly.
5;Lavazza coffee, truly Italian.;I don't regularly drink coffee but my wife does.  After a visit to Italy a few years ago my wife became hooked on great coffee, and Lavazza is just that.
4;baby approved;Both my children love these and I love that they are made with some veggies. These are a great snack, easy for the babe to hold, and don't make a mess.
5;Love that lemon bite;When I first ate one I thought Wow..
5;Excellent taste!;First, the chips arrived in perfect condition having been double-boxed by Amazon, with the outer box very sturdy.  I have share the chips with friends, and we all love them!  Very unique taste.
5;No problem;Someone was saying these are all dented.  Not a single can of mine was.
5;Beautiful lollipops!;I must say, I was not expecting these lollipops to come shipped so safely and arrive with 0 broken.  These lollipops were packaged extremely well and none of them were broken.
2;Cats didn't like it;I have 5 cats and for some reason -?- Not a 1 of them would eat this food. I personally am impressed with Newman's products.
5;Turned her teeth around;When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better.
5;Best price for K-cups;Amazon is definitely the way to purchase K-Cups. The pricing is the best and all varieties I enjoy seem to be available.
1;bad licorice;This is the worse salty licorice I have ever tasted.  My friend is European and turned me on to Salty Licorice and the store we bought from could not get it in stock.
5;Best Prank Ever;I bought these, and dumped a whole bunch of them in a candy dish, and laid it out for guests. It's hilarious to see their faces when they get the bad ones
5;Great Cup-a-Soup.;This is one of my favorite Cup-a-Soups. I used to buy in stores - hard to find now.
5;Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Red Beans 'N Rice;We ordered these only because the Black Beans and Rice,which we really. really love, was out of stock.
5;Great bars;These are our favorite bars - not too sweet and all natural. We order them by the bulk every time.
5;sesame crackers;They're great crackers made with sunflower oil.  They taste good and don't detract from the taste of whatever you decide to spread on them.
1;This is the foulest Tea ever;These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill.
5;For serious gingersnap lovers;I confess I do not like ginger, I got these for my husband who like gingery gingersnaps, and well..
5;Excellent flavor;When I bought this coffee I was skeptical that it would live up to it's Amazon rating. After I tried it, it exceeded my expectations.
3;great product but the price has DOUBLED!!!!!;I absolutely love bangkok beans with some brown rice. I bought a 6pack of 10 ounces bangkok beans march 23, 2011 for $17 and it qualified for super free shipping.
5;Distinct yet subtle  Maple  taste!;Love this product. Have been purchasing this product  for the past 2 years from this buyer and it never dissapoints!I mix it up with brown sugar and use it for all my baking!! Not a  strong maple taste if that is what you are looking for but adds just enough maple taste to my baking that makes it  so distinct.
4;Good Snack When Dieting;"These pretzels have a good cinnamon taste and are really crunchy. They are a satisfying ""good for you"" snack as you can nibble on them for quite a while."
5;My cat's favorite treat;I have three rescued cats and feed them regular food of course but when they want a treat they will only eat the Whiskas Savory Salmon. I have tried more expensive treats and pretty near every type and brand.
4;Gotta Love Organic Dog Food from Wellness!;I remember when it was almost impossible to find oragnic dog treats online. Amazon rocks when it comes to buying organic dog treats! I ususally get my treats from doggiemunchies.
5;Flavorful organic vanilla;I use this exclusively in homemade ice creams, frosting, eggnog,and other uncooked items. If you want a vivid vanilla flavor, I highly recommend this product.
5;One of my favorites;I love the McDougall Asian Entr&eacute
2;Too small, too much shell & not enough white fluffy part;I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.
3;so so;It is not real macha.<br />I'm kinda disappointed with that.
5;Plate Organic Chicken treats - 16 oz.;Dogs love this treat.  They are very easy to chew no matter how old the dog is.
5;Excellent!;This mix upholds the high standard of Pamela's Products.  It makes the best coffee cake I've ever had, a lovely, flaky biscuit, and wonderful cookies.
5;ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!;I love, love, love this product. I use it for my hair, skin, cook with it and even use for massages.
4;YUP, most of cans are dented.;yes, most of the cans arrive dented, so if you are fearful of that, don't get it.  But pumpkin is hard to find in the stores other than in fall, so if you like to extend your pumpkin usage to other seasons, this is a good buy.
3;Mixed reactions;When I received the Taco Bell Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce from amazons vine program I was excited.  We are taco lovers (have Taco Tuesday every week) and thought this would be a great addition.
5;Best brand out there...;I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.
5;Great Value for a LOT of M&Ms;What can I say..
5;A snack for everyone in the family;Bought it for a gift.  Arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation.
4;Super sparkly sparkling water.;"There is a reason that they call this ""Talking Rain"" seltzer.  It is one of the loudest cans of carbonated beverage that I have ever opened."
5;Spicy Mustard;I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.
4;"they are good (except for the ""rainforest"" flavor)";"These taste very good, but aren't like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The ""rainforest"" flavor one is my least favorites (I don't recommend this particular flavor)."
1;NOT organic;I bought this because I thought it actually had organic ingredients- as the description stated.  It does not.
1;The Cat Hated This;What can I say, he's a very finicky eater.  He's stuck on one kind of cat food and it isn't in this line.
5;Great size, appeal, and food value for SMALL dogs;"Jerky-type treat, too big for my Yorkshire Terrier to swallow whole, which is great, I have worried a lot about the super-mini ""greenies"" but everyone has always been fine.<br />Anyway, at a special sale price, these are GREAT in every possible way."
1;Extremely Disappointing;Bought some ginger ale and black cherry at my local Giant supermarket. Thought they were okay.
4;A Favorite Treat;"Our dog loved the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Good stuff!;Like the other varieties available, these come in individual packets for use with bottled water which makes them really handy. This particular flavor of Blackberry Pomegranate is more intense than some of the others.
5;tea;My daughter turned me onto this tea in LA when I was visiting them a year ago.  We went to an Asian Market to get some for me to take home with me.
5;Best Caribou;This is the best Caribou kcup if you like a dark, hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity.  Will definitely buy again.
5;Great Baby Food;My wife gets these at Publix all the time.  She doesn't get anything else.
4;Great for training;My 4 month old puppy loves these.  I agree with the other reviewer that they do tend to dry out fast so I recently ordered the PB kind to see if they stay soft longer.
5;Hubby loves his Wick Fowler's Chili;I bought this product for my husband, who's living in Kuwait for a year.  He asked  me to send him some Wick Fowler's Chili, but i couldn't find it in any grocery store.
5;Ginger Snap / Vanilla Wafer Nirvana!;If your grandma ever made molasses cookies, they might have tasted like these extraordinary ginger snaps! They're light and snappy, without being a jaw-breaker. The amount of ginger and sugar is just right and the molasses is unsulphured, thus, there's no yucky aftertaste.
5;Excellent Purchase!;I absolutely Love Popcorners, and the Caramel Flavored are out of this world.  My new favorite snack.
5;SOOOOO GOOD!;I'm addicted to the Lemon Feta.  Had these at the Hilton in Orlando on vacation by the pool and could not stop eating them.
5;delicious;It is so delicious and convenience. If you like to try Japanese style home-made curry, I recommend it because it is typical Japanease a home-cooked meal.
3;Bring Back Rosemary and Olive Oil;I am deeply saddened that my favorite flavor, Rosemary and Olive Oil was replaced by Ranch.  The original 3 flavors were all acceptable snacks for my family.
5;Love these toothpicks.;I love these toothpicks. I used to buy another brand, and I won't name names(Thursday Plantation), until they changed their recipe.
5;Great Coffee;This is one of my favorite K-cup coffees.  Love the flavor.
5;My kid hates peas!;If your child is anything like mine, he or she does not like vegetables and it's a constant struggle to get them to even try a bite. The Peter Rabbit Organics makes getting kids to eat their veggies a problem no more! With apple as the main ingredient and an applesauce consistency, my son will finally eat something I want him to.
5;Great Pretzels;I can't keep these away from my family who do not have to be gluten free. They are a little on the harder side, but taste is good.
5;Mushroom base;Jar of mushroom base arrived broken.  It has been replaced by the seller.
4;Taste good, cheap and easy;I like coffee but I'm not afford to drink three cups of the Starbucks coffee everyday! For my case, the Starbucks via is a nice choice. Try it.
1;Did I get a bad batch?;Donut Shop is one of my favorites. Though it is also the blend I get the most failures with.
5;Trappeys;We love hot peppers and many times around here when you buy them they are not as hot as we would like. We stumbled on these at store one day and bought them to try.
5;Delicious Organic Lollipops!;These are so tasty and my kids love them!  I feel good letting them eat something that has no high fructose corn syrup, that is organic, and actually made with real fruit.  Kind to them, kind to the earth.
2;Inconsistent moisture content;We've been giving this treat to our little Yorkie for over two years and she absolutely loves them. However this is the second time we've had to arrange for a replacement shipment because the manufacturer isn't able to provide consistent quality.
5;My tea;Love the ability to order my tea in bulk and online.  Being disabled and transportation challenged, I find this very helpful.
5;Don't want to live without this;My daughter (who worked at a natural foods store as the supplements specialist) recommended this to me to help with muscle spasms, and it's really been of great benefit. After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while.
3;Less than $3 at my local CostCo;The price was less than $3 at my local Costco.<br /><br />Saigon Cinnamon is good in tiny amounts for Vietnamese Pho broth or other hearty broths.
5;great bargain;This is a great bargain - a much better deal than I can get at my local pet store. I use these as special treats for my dogs - not an everyday thing but for especially good behavior or when I'm compelled to pamper them.
5;Great Tasting Bar;Larabar bars are great because they are all natural with no artificial ingredients. This really tastes like a peanut and jelly sandwich.
5;Excellent - don't get the reviews.;This coffee is great - reminds me of what I get in Dubai and the Middle East.  Easy to make.
5;Lame without it.;I have a 14 year old Portugueses Water Dog. If she doens't take HipAction, she will be lame in her shoulder.
5;Please don't stop carrying this Jell-O;This is one of the best flavors that Jell-O makes.  I too could not find it locally except at one store (Brookshires in Texas).
5;Wonderful stuff!;"I am very leery of ""energy drinks."" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either."
5;Yum !!!!!;Very good, nice flavor,a good way to start a cool fall day and no after taste..
1;Are you nuts?;Are you nuts? a 3 oz jar of Knorr seasoning for meat is not worth more than $4.00 Who is coming up with a price of $29.
5;Becareful, you might get sick!;So how does this review work with a title like that? Mainly because when you have 100 slim jims at your disposal. You are likely to eat them at a fast rate! They were fresh and tasted great.
5;DELICIOUS AND VERSATILE;Only 44 calories for 2 thins full of flavor and crunch.  Just the right balance of texture and delicious sesame and corn.
4;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.
5;Great snack!;These chips are more expensive in the store, when you can even find them.  I have ordered them from Amazon a few times and have received them in good condition every time.
2;Disappointed dogs;After reading several satisfactory reviews on Amazon, I purchased the Zuke's Turkey and Taterz mini bakes.  My two dogs are not picky eaters and especially love turkey and potatoes.
5;we love these!;very good crackers.  I have been looking for them in the stores here, and due to a winter storm, I decided to have someone ship them to me!  It's a lot of creackers, but we'll eat them and give some as gifts.
4;Lemon at your fingertips!;These are great for taking with you to restaurants or for home use. Studies have shown that a lare number of bacteria have been found on lemon wedges at restaurants, so these packets are wonderful.
5;Great hard sour candy;These are delicious.  They have the same consistency as a Spree or Runt, and they are sour all the way through.
5;perfect for kids (and adults) on a sugar-free diet;We really enjoy these.  Those expecting the taste of the artificial pops may be disappointed, but if you just wish you can have a freeze pop like your sugar-eating friends -- then, you will be quite satisfied!<br />We just wish that A.
5;Great taste;I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.
5;Whether you're grown or growing, this is the YUMMIEST fruit snack going!;I'm not exactly a kid (born December 5, 1967, you do the math)but I had to try these things when I saw them in my local natural-foods market, and they are PLENTY OF YUMMY. Sweet yet zingy, fruity-fresh flavor, firm but tender texture.
5;Great chocolate snack;This is one of my favorite candies to satisfy my chocolate sweet tooth. The milk chocolate has a nice smooth taste, and the wafer has just the right texture--not too hard or soft or crumbly.
5;Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla;I normally buy this product in a larger city a couple of hours away.  Have not been able to find it in my town.
3;not bad;"as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad.  seems like nothing is really ""good"" so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable."
5;The best chocolate;Milka is das beste chokolate in der World. Tastes so very good.
4;The perfect crunch!;This new product packs the perfect crunch into sweet bar. I love the bits of white chocolate.
5;Greatest hazelnut chocolates ever!;These chocolates are such a great find! I was looking for a special type of hazelnut chocolate called gianduja. I searched for it and found this perfect selection! It is the smoothest, creamiest hazelnut chocolate I have found.
5;"A real ""Blast of butter""";This microwave popcorn is fabulous..
5;Veggie Review?;This is canned corn, It tastes like corn.  It feeds my hungry family of four with enough left for seconds.
5;Delicious source of heart-friendly dark chocolate;The ingredients of this chocolate bar are listed on the package as: sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, cocoa processed with alkali, milk fat, lactose (from milk), soy lecithin, PGPR emulsifier, vanillin, artificial flavor, milk. It is 17% fat (a healthy fat from cocoa butter, with no trans fats), 7% carbohydrates and less than 1% protein.
5;Delicious chips cooked in coconut oil.;I love these chips.  They taste delicious and aren't overly sweet, just a hint of sweetness.
3;A little truth please;"Although the smoked oysters were acceptable, the description was not. I purposely chose this product because the description said ""product of USA."
5;Excellent for a canned soup;I usually make mine from scratch but this is an excellent fast alternative.  I found a full can of milk makes the soup to watered down so I cut back to 1/2 a cup.
5;Great price on a wonderful product;Excellent price on a tea I drink every day.  One of the best Chai teas available.
5;wonderful.;Yes, this is a wonderful flower, I bought what I want. Good quality.
5;Just what I was looking for;Jennifer's review was spot on, I love this French Vanilla cappuccino! This is exactly what I was looking for, yes it's not your Starbucks cappuccino, it's more like what you get at mini-marts or service stations. I'm not a hard coffee drinker and this is just what I was looking for, Thank You, Jennifer.
5;SPORTea;Absolutely love this product. Great taste.
5;Saved my Diabetic Cat's Life;Short version: cat diagnosed with diabetes, insulin & Hill's prescription food not stabilizing glucose levels despite increasing insulin weekly over 4 weeks, switched food to Fancy Feast Classic Turkey and Giblets Feast, glucose levels normal after 1 week, decreased insulin dose dramatically, glucose still stable. May go off insulin completely soon.
1;Mixed Bag of squares;Received this item and was looking forward to enjoying the candy.  But, to my disappointment, the bag did not contain the peanut butter squares that were advertised.
5;If I Recommended Just ONE Product this year, it would be this (regarding pets/yards)!;"I put this on hubby's ""to do"" list and after waiting for over a week, I finally bit the bullet and decided to put this together myself. I dread putting stuff together (I thought that was a perk of getting married!)."
4;Expensive, but small and tasty;The title says it all.  They taste good and let you get your crunch on when you're trying to avoid carbs.
4;Great Value;Not the best Earl Grey I have tasted but certainly acceptable for regular drinking.  The exceptional price makes it a great value.
5;You do it;"You are making it too inconvenient for me to give you a review. Make it easier- "" less customer typing "" or do not ask me to review again."
3;Just okay...;This is a disappointing soda from a quality company( I consider their black cherry to be the best soft drink I've ever had).  The flavor has an unpleasant chemical taste to it somewhat like a Sunkist or the dreaded, undrinkable, Big K.
1;They do NOT work.;I have lots of flies in my house.  I set up the two traps.
5;Kids love them!;My kids have always loved these. They are light with the tiniest hint of sweetness on the outside with a very good flavor.
5;Best Earl Grey out there;I've been drinking Earl Grey tea for years now and I've yet to find a better brand than Stash.  Many have tried.
4;Good but strong;This coffee is good but strong.  If you don't like it on the strong side, use less.
5;Tomatoe Powder from Amazon spice section.....;"If you are a Bloody Mary drinker and you have searched around for the best juice, search no more!!!! it is not the tomato juice you want but the ""tomato powder"" than go from there with your favorite ingredients. It is also good in any dish that calls for tomatoes and you don't want the actual tomatoes but the essence or flavor."
5;my cats favorite treat;My cat would rather eat these treats than eat her meals. She wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to the corner of the table where we give her the these treats.
5;deeply satisfying;I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness.
5;Healthy and Good Tasting;I really love the taste of this cereal. The fiber content is incredibly high.
5;The best for low/no sugar jam!;The best for low or no sugar jams! I have used it successfully with agave, coconut sugar & honey as well. Absolutely will NOT use anything else.
5;Worked!;After years of traps, flooding, poison bait, and gas bombs, I tried this trap based on the good reviews.  Caught him on the first day!  I have not seen any evidence of gophers since.
4;Good for Asian-style food, but pricey per serving;"I purchased 3 types of these noodles at my regular grocery store in the refrigerated area where tofu is sold. The package says ""Keep Refrigerated"", so it is a little puzzling that these can be sold and then shipped with no refrigeration."
5;Two dogs - both love these!;We have two dogs and one is a very picky eater with food allergies. They both gobble these up and the one with allergies has no problems with them.
5;Makes everything more delicious;Fattoria Estense's silver label balsamic vinegar has been my (Italian-American) family's go-to brand for years.  We love how it brings out the flavor of so many different foods, from vegetables to meats to strawberries.
5;The only thing missing that I was looking for is the Subscribe & Save program for this item.;"""Excellent vendor that I would use again. (The only thing missing that I was looking for is the Subscribe & Save program for this item."
5;Excellent Dark Chocolate.;My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar.
5;Very good!;I tried these on the recommendation of other reviews here, and I'm very happy with the product! The taste is smooth and rich, and I didn't have any sediment in the bottom of my cup. The k-cup-type design worked perfectly in my Keurig.
5;German Shepherd's Favorite;My girl has loved these for two years.  When the local retail outlet, Trader Joes, no longer carried them-we found the manufacturer.
1;Gross!;My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy.
5;NO JOKE...The best brownies of my life, gluten or no gluten! Kid tested Mother approved!;NO JOKE..
5;Great gourmet natural beef jerky;Healthy all natural beef jerky at a low price. Snackmasters beef jerky has no preservatives, nitrate free and  high protein snack.
1;Terrible;This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy.
3;Not to my taste;A box of these was included with my new Keurig system. I fear and detest weak coffee, but a 10oz serving of this is still strong, with a satisfying body to it.
2;I liked it at first...;The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it.
5;Yorkie likes!;"It can be difficult writing reviews of pet food/treats for obvious reasons and most everyone can read the nutritional information in the item description area, so I will just say that our large build 12 lb Yorkie LOVED these treats!  There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her ""puppy dog"" eyes."
4;Good cup of coffee;The taste is bold, but smooth, good flavor.  Even when used on the large cup brew (10oz), it still has a great taste, not watered down.
1;Not good;I used the spray for about 10-15 minutes and nothing came out.  It's a bad system that the hose hooks up to and doesn't work.
5;best organic carrots!;These are by far the best organic carrots I have tried for my baby. She loves the bright orange color and flavor Also, since carrots were listed by her pediatrician as one of the foods to not make yourself due to high nitrate levels, I feel good feeding these to her (the pediatrician did not know if organic counted or not and said to be on the safe side avoid making homemade baby food out of carrots, beets, collard greens, and spinach).
2;Did something change?;I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years.  When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.
4;Great crispy crunch and flavor;"My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href=""http://www."
3;A little less than expected;"I was looking for custard powder which would be the equivalent of South African Moirs brand and someone suggested this. It was ok but tasted a little ""powdery"" compared to Moirs."
5;great coffee;the coffe was very good but a little pricey. Well worth it for a good change to your regular coffe routine.
3;The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....;I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.
5;Great Product;My dogs love this dog food and so do I because it doesn't contain anything unhealthy.  I have been feeding my dogs this product for years and they are very healthy.
5;Good and affordable cat food;One of my cat got very sick few months ago and had surgery. $1800 later he came back home very weak and skinny and of course no appetite.
3;Made in China;Sorry to see this product was made in China. After the discovery of the bad dog food from China in addition to other things (lead paint in children's toys), I don't feel completely confident that these treats are not harmful.
5;Brodies' teas are delicious;We enjoy afternoon tea every day, and we are very fussy about the tea we buy.  Brodie's has definitely become our favorite.
1;From concentrate;If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.
5;great tea, great price, great service;"Being British in America and finding a good ""cuppa"" is almost impossible. but I think with the stash breakfast tea I can happily live here forever."
2;Good but SALTY, SALTY, SALTY!!!!!;Very good seasoning blend, but sooooooooooooooooo salty!!! Way over the top salty for my tastes. And the salt free version uses something in place of the salt which seems to make it really bitter.
5;Very flavorful;I purchased these for my family to snack on and I haven't tasted flavor this good since I was a kid. It's worth every penny and you won't be unsatisfied.
5;Cats love it;My Cats love this grass kit. It refillable, it lasts longer, and is cheaper than the stuff at the pet stores.
5;good stuff;Keeps me going for about 3 hrs, Great price, better than drinking carbonated drinks that are bad for me. Easy to carry and low calories.
5;gluten free foods;This is the second flavor of this granola I have purchased. I loved the cranberry flavor so much I decided to try this one as well! I was not disappointed! This granola is as good, if not better,than regular granola.
1;OLD & CRUMBLED;The bars I received were crumbled on one end & light tan in color, which indicates OLD chocolate. That end of the bar tasted awful.
5;My dogs loved it!;3 very picky eaters enjoyed this very much. Arrived extremely fast, and passed the 'taste test' by a dog notorious for starving himself rather than eating food he doesn't want.
2;I like Newman's Own but not this product;I am disappointed to have to give this product an unfavorable review. The licorice has barely a hint of pomegranate yet all the calories associated with a super sweet licorice.
5;"Another ""Good and Good for You"" product";I depend on having a healthy lunch (most days!) at work.  I have found an excellent combination for me:  A big plop of Greek yogurt, a cup of whatever fruit is in season and on sale, and a serving of high fiber cereal.
5;Awesome;Great on the go snacks.  Cinnamon Roll is my favorite.
5;A really delicious tea - lots of rich and unexpected flavors;This is a really excellent tea with reach and subtle flavors.  It's perfect almost any time of day, which is really nice.
1;I'm really dissapointed;Something is not right here. I've been a customer of Amazon for more years than I can count.
4;Nice Gift To Give;Gave this to my cousin and his wife the past two years.  They were very pleased with the cakes they received (and would send me pics of the cakes as they received them).
4;Tastes Great, Even if it is Gluten-Free;Most of the time, gluten free products taste awful.  I don't understand the hype over it, especially if you are not allergic to wheat and don't have celiac disease (which is acquired GENETICALLY, not through a diet).
3;Not really different than regular Hershey's syrup;"I realize this is Hershey's ""Special Dark"" chocolate syrup,and not meant to evoke an actual ""dark"" chocolate (meaning high % of cacao), but it's still just mostly sweet with a little chocolate flavor. I'm not really sure I see the point."
4;It's a classic;
2;not bad;The candy was a lttle tougher than I had hoped.  I had tried some home made version of watermelon flavored twists and got hooked.
4;great and not overly sweet;These are a great snack food when you want something that is semi-sweet but not ultra sugary. They go well with tea or hot cocoa.
1;REVISED REVIEW .....NOT San Marzano ... Description and Picture are NOT correct;The product I received, yesterday (3/18/2011), were the ordinary Italian Tomatoes that you can find any where.  The description and picture with the San Marzano region name name is for a totally different product from Cento .
5;Truffle Oil;The flavor of this is great..
5;decadent treat with less guilt;These peanut butter sandwich cookies had the right combo of salt and sweet. IMHO these taste better and less cloying than Late July sandwich cookies (those are good too though).
4;Good? Yes. Messy? Yes, in Hot Weather;No doubt, this is a good tasting peanut and peanut butter bar. All the kids liked it.
5;discontinued???;Ok, I quit smoking cigs in July of '09 with the HELP of Wrigley's FLARE gum. The Flare has to be the BEST EVER cinnamon gum I have ever chewed.
5;Mentos Cinnamon;Love this candy..
5;Delicious!;I used to live in Germany for many years. I miss the taste of good German cooking.
5;Well trained cats;"My pride of 11 ""rescue"" cats found it easy to help themselves. From the 5 month olds to the 15 year olds, they all love Seafood Medley."
5;Tastes great!;I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.
5;A New Favorite;I'm always seeing everywhere how good green tea is for you and how we should all be drinking it (not too exciting though, I know).  I stumbled across this Stash tea variation that combined my favorite (Chai) WITH green tea.
5;Lard, lard, lard;This lard is the BEST lard that you could EVER..
4;Good assortment;After visiting the Cayman Islands on a cruise and coming back with just one pack of Tortuga chocolate cake, I decided to get this 6 pack to give friends and also try the key lime and original golden cakes.  Key lime was definitely much better than I expected.
5;Pretty good instant coffee.  I'm impressed.;I didnt have time before work to stop by the coffee shop, glad i kept a few of these packets in my desk at work.<br /><br />12oz hot water worked out well.
5;good;My cat only wanted this sliced turkey for several weeks then decided he didn't want it anymore. I keep a variety of flavors on hand because just like people cats don't like to eat the same thing at every meal.
5;Best Peanut Butter Ever;I've had all flavors of Skippy and one jar of every other brand I could find, including the old fashioned ones that separate, and this one was the best for my needs.<br /><br />It tastes as good or better than regular skippy.
1;The most bitter stevia I ever tasted;It tried this in my oatmeal a couple of times. It took me two days to realize it was the stevia.
1;worked for 1 week....;The product worked for a week or so. The cover on the plastic started to come off right at the first time we used it.
5;Whole grains;this product is clean and packaged in a tough plastic bag. excellent way to add whole grains to your diet, and help in losing weight naturally.
1;Makers Mark Bourbon Flavored Gourmet Cherries;They are exactly as titled. But the company was terrible about sending them! They were ordered/paid for a Christmas present in around October and still had not come before Christmas and when called they still took there time sending them and didn't even apologize.
5;A healthy wet cat food at a reasonable price;After the second cat of three cats in my household started having problems with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, I got serious about researching cat foods and decided to try Natural Balance. They make a totally grain-free hard cat food that I decided to supplement with their wet food.
5;Probably the best crunchy peanut butter I've ever had;I don't consume peanut butter very often, but when I do, I usually buy the crunchy kind.  I decided to try Jif Natural Crunchy and I'm not disappointed.
5;Good value for the money;While this rice flour isn't as fine as some, it's fine enough for most cooking.  At Christmas time I used it to make half a dozen different types of gluten-free cookies that family members not on a gluten-free diet said they couldn't tell had been made with rice flour - no grittiness at all.
5;Best mix ever;I grew up eating homemake pancakes from scratch every Saturday and haven't been great about contenting this tradition with my children - until now!!! I recently was turned on to Kodiak Cakes from a relative. Not only are they healthy (whole grains and no fillers!) but they taste unbelievable.
5;Good coffee;Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point.
5;Great snack anytime!;I recently purchased this item after finding out how good Pumpkin seeds are for you.  I really like these because they are not too salty unlike some other brands and they are organic.
5;Sesame Goodness;Over the years I have always enjoyed sesame candies. This tastes so delicious,both the chocolate and sesame flavors come through clearly.
1;HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!;"The product description says: ""Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange.""<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful."
3;This was very tasty but way to fatty!;This rack of lamb cooked up beautifully and tasted terrific (with a whole lot of herbal rub plastered all over it) but it was just WAYYYYY too fatty.  The amount of grease coming off of it astounded me.
4;Good tasting water with electrolytes.;This Essentia purified water is infused with electrolytes, which are ideal for an energy boost.  While a lot of athletes get their electrolytes from Gatorade, this water would be perfect if you don't care for the Gatorade sweetened flavors.
3;they were okay;Very colorful and bright! Perfect addition to my candy table at my wedding. Nerds inside were good but the gum outside tasted horrible.
5;Tasty tea;I'm generally a fan of Earl Grey tea, and this is a good one. The flavor is strong but not overpowering.
5;best brownies ever!;Received these as a gift from a friend..
3;Great Tea, but not what is pictured.;I bought this tea thinking it was the normal Acai Mango flavor, especially since the picture shows it. But in fact read the title carefully, this is the Ice version of the flavor! I now have 6 boxes of the wrong flavor.
5;Excellent bread, especially when toasted;This bread is extremely healthy and wholesome, particularly because the bread is primarily made from whole grain rye.  Whole grains in their whole form are particularly healthy because it takes longer for your body to break them down.
5;Too good to be true, but it is - Just Delicious;This is just the best.<br />This is the only thing that persuaded me to stay on low-carb, would have given up otherwise.
5;Addicted!;Simply addictive. I can't keep a steady supply cause I go through a bottle every 4-5 days and I only use it for Ice Tea.
5;Pamela's is Perfect!;Pamela's Products are perfect for people with Celiac Disease!  The Baking and Pancake Mix is really easy to use, and I use it as a cup for cup substitution in several recipes.  Anything chocolate works great.
2;Too Salty;I love oil cured olives, and these would be fine, except that their is about 5 to 10 times too much salt in them. I cut them up and add them to salads, etc, but as whole olives, again the salt is way too high (think of really salty potatoe chips and then make them 10 times more salty).
5;Yum;Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as jalepeno smoke, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts.
3;Really expensive popcorn. Does not get stuck in teeth as much as other brands.;Really expensive popcorn. Does not get stuck in teeth as much as other brands.
5;Wake up with Pepper Plant Original Hot Sauce;I first had this wonderful concoction on a breakfast table in Carmel California.  It is a wonderful addition to any egg dish and particularly on omelete's.
2;Very salty;I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.
5;Light Not Too Sweet;I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this coconut water. Other coconut waters are way too sweet and is definitely saturated with sugars.
5;Luscious caesar dressing;Lately, I haven't been able to find this salad dressing mix in the stores.  So, I ordered 2 boxes of the Simply Organic Classic Caesar Dressing from Amazon.
5;Stash Tea;Great Service and good price. Arrived in a very timely manner.
5;Great taste!;Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.
5;Pero - Excellent replacement for Postum;My sister-inlaw was looking for a drink (caffine free) substitute for coffee.  We drank coffee flavored Postum and suggested she try it.
4;good but not as good as 2 layer;I like these better than the larger sardines from Portugal or Morocco, but they are not as good as the even smaller 2 layer pack brislings.  The 2 layer cross pack are the best.
3;Tastes very good although not so much of hazelnuts;I have always been a fan of the Lindt Lindor Truffles.<br />The Lindt Lindor Hazelnut Truffles taste absolutely delightful and I could finish the entire box in a single day.
5;Excellent product for travelers;I am a frequent long trip traveler and also choose to eat a plant-based (vegan) diet. The flax paks are travel friendly and allow me to have my omega 3's every morning with cereal anywhere in the world.
2;Ick;This soup is just offensive.  Why does it taste like cinnamon?  Also, it's twice the price of Campbell's and 1/4 the chicken.
4;"The best ""stock"" I've found in the grocery store";I have been on a soup-making kick for awhile now, and while I much prefer to make my own chicken stock, I do it so rarely that it turns directly into chicken soup. So I bought various chicken stocks, mostly organic, and really started to notice a difference in the resulting soups.
1;Had ball out in 2 minutes!;I just brought this home and gave it to my dog(cattle dog mix) and she literally had it out in 2 minutes flat. This is supposed to provide hours of interactive chewing challenge(as it states on packaging) but it didn't even give 5 minutes! I guess if your dog is a master chewed like mine, the extreme kong is a better choice.
4;Very close to the real deal, but are they really worth the money?;I took a chance and bought the case of 6 here on amazon instead of trying out a box from whole foods. I'm glad I did.
5;NOT involved in the recall;I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs. This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues.
1;Came up in K cup search, but not compatible!!!;This product came up in my search for k-cups for the Keurig. However, they are NOT k-cup compatible!!! They are packets of coffee contained in a filter pouch.
2;Of al the Stash iced teas this is the best, and it is still not all that good;What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets.
5;Versatile and not overpowering.;This is one of the best easily available hot sauces for regular people with normal tolerance<br />for spice.<br /><br />Cholula uses a blend of arbol and piquin peppers.
1;Quality control has become a problem;I have loved Emeril's coffee for years. I ordered 4 boxes which arrived a few days ago.
5;LOVE IT!;I love this product..
4;ziwipeak lamb liver treats;My 3 cats, aka picky eaters, actually did sample these treats, and came back for more.  That's the best recommendation there is.
5;Love this coffee;Like so many others, I used Seatle's Best or Starbucks until they opted out. I'm actually happy they did as it forced me to try other coffees, some of which, including Mastro Lorenzo Crema, have become favorites.
5;Dogs loved it!;As far as my two terrier mixes (20 and 30 lbs. respectively and very active chewers) are concerned, this is another great product from FunBites! Finally, a safe, longer-lasting chew that doesn't smell bad, stain the rugs, or leave offensive debris.
5;Great;This is the only cereal that agrees with me and that I eat every morning.  I have Celiac disease so this is very beneficial in my diet and has the right ingredients for me.
2;Oh well...;My friend and I are always looking for a new healthy snack..
1;Very disappointed;Very weak coffee, just a hint of pumpkin spice--would not recommend--get dunkin donuts pumpkin coffee 100% better. I am now stuck with this terrible coffee.
5;Quite delicious;We used to purchase a very similar-tasting English Breakfast organic bulk tea at a local market for nearly twice the price.  Glad we stumbled upon this find.
3;A Little stale;Pkg arrived quick as does most of the items I order thru Amazon. We tryed three packs over the last week and all three tasted a little stale.
1;Not 85%, apparently - or mislabeled;"the wrapper for this so-called ""85% chocolate"" says that in a 40-gram portion (1 serving), 8 grams is sugar.  well that is 20% sugar already."
4;Love the flavors;I am in love with the Rise Bar brand. My favorites are their breakfast bars, which have a chunkier and crispier consistency.
5;Best dog treat ever;Finding these treats was a complete fluke. When on vacation in Hollywood, FL we stopped in a gourmet pet store.
2;Not so;This sauce claims that it makes chinese style barbecue spareribs so I was excited that I wouldn't have to buy out so often if I had some on hand. Turns out it tastes nothing like what you get at the chinese place.
5;Great buy @ Amazon;If you're big coffee drinkers like my family, ordering in bulk like this is great and it never goes stale.  With coffee costing anywhere from $6.
5;My wife and I love these;My wife and I love these. I bought these for her christmas stocking and they lasted about a day.
5;Nestles Crunch Candy Bars;Delicious and the price is cheaper than anywhere else that I know of. Fresh and really delicious tasting.
5;Recommended for Organic Diets;Since my pom was diagnosed with cancer, we have modified her diet to include only organic, high protein, no wheat or added sugar type products. I prefer to buy only USDA treats to be sure of the ingredients.
2;Not very flavorful;Not very flavorful.  Bought after getting high reviews here on Amazon and Kohls.
1;nasty;I am from Jamaica, and I had coconuts straight from the trees and this does not taste natural at all, as a matter of fact this is the worst tasting coconut water I have ever tasted.  I was very disappointed, Zico does not come close.
5;Great for soups;I could not get the quick barley at Albertson's so turned to the internet.<br />Although 12 boxes is a lot of barley, I was able to sell some of them to friends for cost at $3.
5;Sweet tins of tiny mints for purse or pocket!;I purchased this pack of 12 tins of Tropical Fruits mints at the same time as ordering another set that was a smaller variety pack of 6 different tins. ( see my other review )This package of 12 tins are all one flavor, but they are perfect for almost anyone who loves fruits, especially pineapple and other tropicals.
5;Cat goes nuts for this stuff;My cat goes absolutely nuts for Wellness Chicken & Herring!!  It is grain free and high quality.  I've thoroughly researched cat food and this is the best quality at a decent price.
5;Miracle Fruit--Ethan's Garden;Great service, Great product, just awesome. The shipping really is included in the price though that may be confusing, came overnight as said perfect timing and in actuality a little be earlier than said.
4;Nice Cocoa Sandwich Cookie;I brought these cookies by the carton because my husband and I<br />like cocoa imported from Germany and Switzerland.<br />This cookie has a nice cocoa favor with a hard biscuit like cookie.
5;Love this BBQ Sauce!!;The Cattlemens Kansas City Classic BBQ Sauce is phenomenial. Were impressed with the distinct flavor of just enough sweet & tangy combined that leaves you with that savory salivating mood when you think of this BBQ sauce.
4;Cats love the food, but difficult to squeeze out of package;I purchased these to replace the one or two cans of cat food I feed my two very old cats to supplement their crunchy food.  They LOVE the Whiskas poultry combo flavors and seem to have an easy time eating it, but there are always one or two morsels stuck in the bottom of the pouch, and I sometimes get the gravy on my hands when squeezing the food out of the package.
4;Nice selection of Lucaffe products;Lucaffe is good, but Laxazza is better.  The all-Columbian Lucaffe pods are the highlight of this package.
1;Bag arrived opened.;Delighted that the shipment arrived one day early, but disappointed when I opened the box and discovered the bag had arrived already opened. There was Farro all over the bottom of the box.
5;Please get past the taste.;You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.
5;gravy;love gravy on my bread or corn bread. tastes great with a variety of food.
5;Love them, but wish they had a 6 pack instead of a 12.;I love the salt free blue corn chips. When I lived in Florida I ate salsa/hummus/blue corn chips for lunch pretty much every day.
3;Good Price & Quality, but Better Deals Are Available;For anyone who does any cooking that involves poppy seeds, it makes total sense to buy in semi-bulk.<br /><br />For the cost of two, twenty-eight ounces of these high quality Colorado Spice seeds, you might be able to buy a few ounces (6-9 bottles) from your local grocery store.
2;SLOW SHIPPING - LESS FILLING;Shipping is terrible. I've paid for 24 cans of this chew to arrive in two days(due friday) and it arrives the following week monday! But on top of that, it seems that there are a few cans that have less than others.
5;Help for gluten-free diets;These make it easy for me to stay wheat and gluten-free.  I like to keep a box in the car with me or tuck them into my suitcase when traveling.
1;Cake never arrived..;Photo of the cake looks good and I was happy I can send a choco cake to someone really far away from me.<br /><br />I called store to make sure they can deliver item on time (about a week).
5;Better than Secret;I had been a Secret gal for years and years, but decided to give Dove Ultimate Clear a try when I was shopping at Sams Club and they were out of Secret. I didn't realize how effective it truly was until I switched back to Secret after running out of Dove.
5;Great dog food;I foolishly purchased the HARMONY FARMS Healthy & Holistic Adult Dog Food, since it had more for the same price(why it had good reviews is beyond me). My dogs will not touch the harmony farms, yet love this dog food.
5;Great for crafting;I'm using these sprinkles for resin so I cannot comment on the taste or how they would stand up in baking.<br /><br />I use these inside my resin pieces to add cuteness and they work great.
5;Nice tea set;Purchased these as a gift.  I was told by the recipient (an advent tea-drinker) that it tastes wonderful, and the leaves blossom very big.
4;Tasty trip down nostalgia lane;I'm hoping that my co-workers love this candy as much as I do! Also, if you head to the manufacturer's website you might see a different price on their online store..
5;Two paws way up;Both of our picky-eater pugs responded very enthusiastically (I may have to come back and post a video review)! Ordering three more cases today! Love that you can actually identify everything that's in the can. The pop tops are another huge bonus, especially for people like us who travel frequently (don't even need a utensil to get the food into a bowl
5;The doggie equivalent of popping in a new DVD for the kids:  Silence and Peace!;I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths. Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game.
5;Awesome!;This stuff is yummy! I was afraid to try this since I love regular butter so much. I have read about the health benefits of ghee and after ordering this, I am hooked! It's so delicious.
5;Me and the kitties love them;I bought these for hairball control rather than treats, and I wasn't disappointed. My long-hair coughs up a ridiculous amount of hairballs and she is too picky to take any kind of hairball control treat or medication (I've wasted so much money on things she won't eat).
5;A great buy;I am very happy with this purchase.  The only con is that you don't get as much of the good cereal (Kashi, Smart Start) as you would like and get a ton of Flakes, Rasin Bran, and Rice Crispies.
3;My intro to green tea;I gave this tea less stars becaue Im new to green tea and didnt want to be misleading. I liked it all.
1;very artificial flavor;I tried this coffee once and I am throwing away the rest. The taste is very artificial.
5;Num nums!;Wanted my daughter to keep organic as much and long as possible so we tried this brand first & this veggie when she started solids.  It smelled good and from the first spoonfull (it's not so runny it won't stay on a spatula style spoon) she loved it!  This is her fave veggie so far.
5;As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!;This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull.  The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.
5;I love this product!!;This is a fantastic product.  I even use it for regular wheat bread.
1;popcorn dud;I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much. I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest.
5;Knorr Entree Mixes - Goulash/Beef Stew;In my opinion, the best beef stew/goulash mix on the market.  Very reasonably priced, and service through Amazon is great.
5;Excellent coffee, best I've found in K-Cups;I'm always in search of the perfect cup of coffee. Prior to getting a Keurig for Christmas I would make multiple visits a day to a local Starbucks or Seattle's Best for my usual Tall or Grande bold brew of the day served black so I could savor the flavor.
4;nice cup of joe;makes a good cup of coffee at a reasonable cost. not a true k-cup but works well in a keurig.
3;Peppermint Mocha;This drink can be made with water or milk, and I chose milk.  The directions suggest 6-8 ounces of milk or water with 4 teaspoons of the drink mix.
4;Pretty good;So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.
3;Smoked salt:  doesn't deliver;I'm a big fan of smokey foods, so I was eager to try smoked salt, hoping it would add complexity and intrigue to food that isn't, itself, smoked.  When I opened the pack and a lovely, subtle wave of smokey scent rose up, I was optimistic.
4;Nice but pricey;This is a nice item -- chunks of meat, good gravy. My cat is not fond of all the varieties, but it is a nice little treat nonetheless.
5;Wonderful;Perfect. A meal bar that is not just good tasting but nutritious and healthy as well.
5;never go back to salted pretzels again.;crunchy,satisfying and delicious.  They are alsoguilt free with very low sodium snd no fat.
4;slightly less than what I expected;This roast wasn't as good as I expected.  I loved Cafe Altura's French Roast's very intense (almost spicy) flavor and oiliness, which I often use for espresso.
5;Tasty And Good For Us;Wheat germ doesn't need any endosements for its health benefits: they are well known. I use the stuff because it tastes good, adding it to some bread and biscuit doughs and to cereals.
5;Real Green Tea;This tea was recommended to us by some friends from Japan.  They told us that the green tea that is sold in most grocery stores is not authentic green tea.
5;Tasty;Excellent product and excellent service from this seller. Lime pickle is a must-have relish as part of an Indian feast, but my favorite everyday use is as a garnish to tuna salad.
5;very addictive.;Got hooked on these in Australia. Pepperidge Farms is doing a good job making a replacement for Arnott here in the U.
5;My loud mouth cat loves it.;My Cat is coming up on his 13th year and suddenly when we are home he never stops yowling. There is nothing wrong with him medically, he just began demanding an insane amount of attention (he already gets more attention than most children) and begs for food even when he is not hungry because he wants you to come in the kitchen and pay attention to him.
4;tasty treat;this wasn't quite what I expected - the last time I ordered a similar treat, it was thinner crispy banana slices - these are thicker bananas.  my dog loves them, but there is so much banana that I can't give her more than one or two a week - too rich - they give her the runs.
4;Doesn't last long for agressive chewers;I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food.
3;No Caffeine Boost;"Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.  You can taste the blueberry, wine and chocolate characteristics, but this light roast coffee does not offer a ""first cup in the morning"" big caffeine boost."
1;This is not any thing close to being a latte or coffee;I was given this product as a Christmas Gift.  Lets just say this is the nastiest tasting imitation of a latte I have ever had.
5;My 4th favorite flavor;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
5;Excellent product... Delicious too!;i have been using this for several months now and i really like it alot. it is delicious.
5;fine spelt berries;If you need spelt berries in small quantities, this is a great choice.  If you want a better price, you will likely need to buy in 25 pound quantities, or more.
5;Tea-licious!;Who would have thunk that such a simple combination (half iced tea and half lemonade) would taste so delicious?  And Arizona makes the best version of the Arnold Palmer.  Tea-licious!<br /><br />Please note, this review is for the product, not the price.
5;Great for the price & health benefits!;I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet.
5;Great Tasting;Having worked in a movie theater in high school and through college, popcorn is a very nice treat.  That was 40 years ago, and it is still a very nice treat.
5;Pills become a treat;We've used Greenies pill pockets with our elderly kitty for his three daily pills for over a year.  He considers medicine a treat.
1;Really gross;I tried this product and it had the most horrible taste. I really thought it would taste nice.
5;Very Pleased;"I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from ""chronic"" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement."
5;awesome cookie!;These taste really great, are soft, and very thick (about 3/4 inch). I just used a medium gingerbread boy cookie cutter to cut it out and my son LOVES THEM- of course he eats the scraps too! This gives us more cookie for the price than if they were already cut out.
5;a product  that is all as advertized;I bought the bulbs  to use in a laundry room to better spot any stains and a living for better light on dark winter days. I am well pleased with both.
5;My-Kap lives up to promise;These make a great cup of coffee.  Messy cleaning for reusing the original cup, but worth it.
2;koala crispy bars;my kids like all of the flavors but chocolate.  They say they just don't taste very good.
5;Ginger Crystals;The instant Ginger Honey Crystals are great. I love them.
5;Nice autumn taste of coffee;This pumpkin spice can be blended with your favorite coffee adding a brisk taste of pumpkin with your blend of other roasted coffees.  I have blended with Emeril's BIG EASY BOLD Gourmet coffee & Coffee People's Donut shop coffee.
5;Sour! Sweet! Yum!;Bite into one of these
5;mmmmmm tulleys!;My favorite out of all the k-cups! We fell in love with the kuerig in our sunday school class simply for its convenience unfortunately though I honestly am a major coffee lover and somewhat of a coffee snob so when we traded our aeropress (which I recommend 100%, I just want something faster these days)I had a hard time finding a k-cup that was bold enough for me-if you like dark french roasts, you know what Im talking about, well to this day, Ive tried many different k-cups, I even have the eco cup where you can put your own coffee in and nothing matches tulleys french roast..
5;Soup's on!;It's a little spendy but you can't find it anywhere in the stores. It was shipped in a timely fashion with a minimum of packaging and arrived in perfect condition.
1;tartaric acid and cream of tartar;Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid.
5;Great product!;I have reordered these four more times now, I really like them.  They are kind of like pork rinds with a lot of flavor, and are healthier than regular chips.
5;Another Great Product from Clif;I prefer these over comparable granola bars in both taste and texture, and the fact that Clif uses 'Organic' ingredients is an added bonus.  I am an avid hiker, and these have held up better than other brands on my hikes.
1;go ahead and eat aluminum;Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to.
3;Good, and Bad;Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.
5;Great for Weight Watchers;I love these brownies.  I do weight watchers, so these are wonderful when I need a chocolate fix.
5;different labels - same great peanuts;"I have purchased The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brand peanuts with several different labels.  They are consistently perfect, with a taste and texture as close as you can get to the old fashioned ""just cooked, hot out of the oil"" peanuts of my youth."
4;Great, super nutritious raw snack;Kind of a scary thought at first.  These taste great.
5;Amazing;I have come to not expect much from dog toys, but friends recommended this after hearing me complain that my little boxer mix destroys her toys in about 5 min after we buy
3;Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds;The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.
5;So addicted!;I absolutely LOVE these! I'm on my third box.  They taste great and have 9 grams of dietary fiber and only 150 calories.
3;Makes you pucker, but tastes good.;I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.
5;Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You;"This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a ""raw"" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw."
4;Great Tasting, Healthy, Only Downfall is the Plastic Container;Great tasting coconut oil that we use in curries or most everything really! Very healthy alternative to margarine, or other 'fake' spreads. I have never used it as a replacement for butter or anything but I hear it tastes very good.
5;Great Pepper;This is nice quality pepper with just enough zing to add to my recipes.  The pepper grinds nicely and  and stays nice and fresh in the grinder.
5;Great Ginger;These Ginger Snaps aare the best I have found.  They also arrive without brakin in to shreds.
5;Too sweet for me but mix with plain chex and you're golden;I bought this because it was on sale and hey we're in a recession, right?<br /><br />I thought it was too sweet.  Maybe it is my adult tastebuds.
5;Thank you;Thank you It came in 3 days..
5;Delicious!!;This Bashmati Rice was delecious, great nutty flavor. A nice compliment to any main course or hot and spicy Curry dish.
5;LOVE;We've been making Miso soup at home for a few months now and this helps it taste very good. Not all salt and lots of flavor.
2;Wouldn't buy agin;Not a good value for the money.  Not as pictured, not nearly as full.
1;Low Quality. High Calorie and Fat.;I wanted to love this. I was even prepared for it to be somewhat like a cheap Circle K Cappuccino.
4;Pretty pretty pretttttyyy good;Got this @ a discount and I must admit it's not the Ovaltine of my youth. Sure, there are still chemicals, but as far as hot chocolate mix goes, this isn't a bad option, taste- or health-wise.
5;Great Product!;Brandl's Death Pepper Spice is great! Just the right amount of flavor and burn! We use it on popcorn, homemade potato chips, and as a general seasoning. You will not be disappointed.
1;Old and tasteless;This tea was produced in March 2009 and sold to me July 2011. It was totally tasteless.
1;Arrived with ants in it!!!;My elderly mom loves peanut brittle, so this was a little gift/treat for her.<br />Sorry, but the packing of this product was so poor that the<br />white bag with the cellophane window that the candy was in<br />arrived in a box with no protective packing - no styrofoam, no<br />newspaper, nothing.
5;Yummy;I love this protein snack bar. Tastes more like a candy bar than a protein bar and is easy to eat, easy to digest and a very quick & satisfying snack.
5;S'mores!;We love Honey Maid's graham crackers in our family, especially having a toddler around they're practically a staple in our household. The Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are conveniently packaged, but still the same graham crackers we've loved.
4;The dog says it is delicious!;I received a 4.5 Lb.
5;great snack for baby;I decided to give these a try since they are fairly cheap.  They are great!  They do not leave the difficult to clean mess that the Biter Biscuits do, and they're not a big choking hazard like the Biters, either (they are easy to bite and dissolve easy in the mouth).
2;May kill bugs , what about you?;If it works remains to be seen as I have just finished treating the exterior of my home.<br />Unfortunately the red on off knob that you rotate to begin spraying is not permanently affixed<br />to the nozzle housing.
4;Good food, good amazon price;Since I am not the one who eats this I can't vouch for the taste..
5;Another Winner in our House;I have been rotating through the many varieties of THK for several months now (nearly a year) and I've seen much improvement in my girls!  Healthy skin and coat, lots of energy and they love the taste.  Keen is also lower priced of all the formulas, making it very cost effective to feed.
5;The best there is.;I have been using this stuff for over 14 years. Yes that's right over 14 years.
5;YUM;These are nicely packaged in single serving sizes.  However, it takes a lot of will power to just eat one!  I noticed another review saying they could not taste the caramel.
5;oh, so good;You may think six jars of ginger spread is too many, but trust me, it's not. This sweet, fiery spread is great with ricotta cheese and peaches on a waffle, with blue cheese and caramelized onions in a tart, or simply with peanut butter in a sandwich.
5;It is awesome.;My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it.
5;Great Coffee for a great system;Columbian coffee is my favorite, and these pods used in the Senseo coffee pot produce a cup full of flavor.  I highly recommend both the pods and the system.
5;Great mix to keep in the pantry!;My son has multiple allergies (dairy, egg, nuts, sesame, etc) and the CK mixes really make things easier for us! Even though I also have other go-to recipes, we always have the pancake, cake, and cookie mixes in the pantry just in case. All the mixes have easy to follow directions so the kids can help too.
5;An acquired taste...;Let me start by saying these are not for everybody.  In fact, my personal experience is that most non-Indian people don't like them at all.
5;delicious and fresh;I generally buy these at the mall as a treat to myself.<br />I broke down and bought the big bag.
2;Not Potato Chips;I found these finally and was quite disappointed. They are OK at best, nothing like potato chips though.
5;Maggie the mostly lab loved them!;Now I will confess, I'm not quite sure how a human reviews a dog treat.  But I will tell you that Maggie my mostly lab (pound puppy of some questionable lineage) took to these like they were candy.
5;Yumm;I enjoy the mild coffee blends that Green Mountain has.  Great price and fast shipping.
4;Dogs love them - Owners hate paying for them!;My dogs are addicted to these things and it's my fault.  Whether or not they are good for my dog's teeth and digestive health is up in the air.
5;Yummmm;Awesome product..
5;A GREAT chew;If you like ginger, this is a candy for you, in addition to it being benefical for your digestive track. Has a wonderful ginger flavor.
5;CET VeggieDents are Great;My dog loves these. I went to the vet to get a bag today and they were out and did not know if they would get more.
5;good for tummy upset;It works. Everybody at work comes and asks me for this tea when their stomach is upset or when they eat too much or have gas.
5;Yummy!;My birds love these things.  It is much better than paying [.
5;Fantastic Product;First, you can either soak or spray this product.  If you're lazy like I am you can put it in a spray bottle, spray your produce in a colander in the sink, and rinse a bit later.
5;A SUPER HEALTHY VERSATILE FOOD;I've eaten Kasha all my life and I'm 66 years old. We always had it as a breakfast cereal and many times for dinner cooked with onions and chicken broth
5;Best Stevia;I have used Stevia extract on and off for years. The SweetLeaf brands are the best I have ever found.
5;An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name;I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged.  And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.
5;My dogs LOVE them!;These treats are fantastic. Made in the USA, grain free, wonderful ingredients.
4;Great mix. Easy to use;If you need a gluten free mix this one is VERY good. The best price I've found is on Amazon.
4;Smooth cup of coffee.;I am a moderate, one cup a day coffee drinker, so i want that cup to be good. This is my favorite, so far.
5;Excellent balance of taste, crunchiness, and moisture;I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends.  :))  My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side.
2;Love the idea, can't stand the smell!;My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.
5;Best PEZ Dispenser EVER!;With so many different PEZ dispensers out there, how can I say that you ask?  There are a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, most PEZ dispensers are simply that: PEZ dispensers.
5;Yum-O!;OK, I've eaten a lot of granola bars that supposedly contain peanut butter but these are the first one that REALLY taste like peanut butter. Probably the finest compliment I can offer is that if I was going to make a crunchy peanut butter granola bar at home, I'm not sure I could make them better than these.
5;Best K-Cup out there if you like strong coffee;Has the richest flavor. Other K-Cup brands taste really bad after you try this one.
5;Tasty;I was a little nervous about giving this as a gift imaging all the horrible things that could go wrong but I was pleasantly surprised. The package was delivered quickly everything was fresh and tasty I would definitely buy again.
5;Excellent.;I am a major fan of the Cornucopia kits and this kit was the third kit of theirs I bought.  The wine was great, but as one reviewer pointed out, the labels are misspelled.
4;Quite good;I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change.
4;licorice tea;Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
5;Salmon Sticks;My dogs love Salmon and its great for their skin. These treats are perfect for the two of them.
5;Meow Mix is the best cat food in the WORLD!;I love meow mix, my cats love it to. We all eat it togther.
2;Difficult Packaging;The appeal of this specific product is suposed to be the packaging. The individual stacks of crackers are smaller than typical.
5;Tasty cookies;Slightly crumbly, but overall a very good cookie.  In my opinion very similar to Chips Ahoy but more airy, less dense.
5;Great value for beginner bonsai;I recently purchased this bonsai for myself because learning this ancient art is something I have always been interested in. I have nothing but good things to say about the seller and this product.
5;Jamica Me Crazy;This is my favorite coffee flavor and I have not had it in a long time.  Forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k-cups.
5;THE best Jerky around!!;This Sweet Spicy Thai Jerky is the best!! Can't find it in local stores, so I got 2 packs. Not too spicy, but lets you know there is a little heat to it.
4;Marley Coffee;I didn't realize this was a single brew coffee.  However, I cut open four of the filter packs and used it in my drip coffee maker.
4;Delish and Healthy;Searched long and hard for a protein shake that didn't have artificial ingredients (aspartame). Have tried this flavor and Choc.
1;Does this product really deserve another 1-star review? Yes it does.;Believe everything you read here, folks. This stuff really IS that bad.
4;Good nutritional value;This product is very easy to make--just add water and spice packet and 25 minutes later you have lentil rice pilaf.  Very good source of protein and fiber.
5;Great for fishing with the grandson;When I go fishing with the grandson, he takes his cigars (old-fashioned bubblegum cigars) and I take mine.  We have great memories of us catching fish and enjoying our cigars.
5;AriZona Arnold Palmer Half and Half, 1.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6);Best instant tea I've tried. It arrived in expected time.
5;best gluten free pretzels!;We love these pretzels.  They are not always in stock at our local store.
5;Great Coffee!;Of all the coffees I've tried -- and I've tried A BUNCH -- this is hands-down my favorite.  Great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste.
5;Goobled it up;I am going to have to buy this for now on for my dog. I have to say he was very excited to eat this food.
5;Great and intense!;I have been buying this product from my local Mediterranean market, but I started ordering it online when the shop stopped restocking them. The Packaging was great to ensure none of these broke, and the quality of the water is intense and great as always.
5;Knox Gelatin;Since moving, I could not find the 32 envelope box of Knox Gelatin locally.  I checked Amazon and was happy to discover that I could have two boxes sent to me every two months at a saving.
5;Best Brownie Mix Ever...but.....;FYI, i'm shocked at the price here..
5;Excellent coffee;As a lover of flavored coffees this is one of my favorites. Not too strong or too weak.
5;Great coffee;This is currently my favorite coffee..
5;Yummy!;This sauce adds a very nice flavor to my Puerco Asado.  I am sure it will go well with chicken, beef and seafood too.
3;Mostly a product without a purpose;This might be handy for someone who wants a convenient, pocket-able, quick treat in a training situation, but otherwise I fail to see the point of this product.  Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.
5;Wahoo!!!!;I found it, I found it!!!  I've been looking for this for years.  It's not sweet or overwhelming.
5;I'm addicted;My daughter introduced me to this item several months ago and I fell in love with it, so to speak.  Due to health reasons, I can't eat popcorn and I like popcorn very much.
5;Chailicious;It's organic that is the first great thing. It is not just black tea.
1;broken cookies;Bought these for a party..
5;Original gift that brought back memories...;"I ordered this item for a gift for a friend of mine who is an 80's enthusiast.  She loved the packaging (""Do Not Open Unless You Are a Child of the 80s!"") and looked through all the candy going, ""I remember these!""."
5;Smints;I received the order quickly and in perfect condition.  I have been unable to find this product at any of my local merchants.
5;Great Teas;Great product, nice containers - works great in the Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Tea makers.  The tea is very tasty and only a small amount (like a teaspoon full is needed to make a delicious beverage).
1;Sour cream powder;Due to getting a comment which pointed out that I had failed to change the rating, I have now done so. Thank you to the one who brought this goof to my attention.
1;Review of chocolate frog;The crispy frog was delicious but it cost me something like twenty five euros in post and packaging! That is ridiculous. How did that happen? It was only a TINY piece of chocolate.
5;A great snack for chocolate lovers;I'm a chocolate lover, but didn't like the filling in chocolate Pop Tarts when I tried them, many years ago. A few years ago, however, a friend gave me a box (he knows I love chocolate), and I was surprised at how good they are now.
5;Delicious and VERY reasonably priced!;I use a lot of cumin and was spending a lot on spice jars from the grocery stores.  I am shocked how much cumin you get for the money from Marshalls Creek Spices.
1;Fake;This candy is definitely not Chick O Sticks. There isn't any coconut surrounding each piece.
1;Not Gluten Free;This product was listed with a special gluten free foods promotion.  I am glad I read the ingredients first!  Although these cookies sound wonderful, buyer beware! They are not and if you are buying for someone with allergies or intolerances this would not be a wise choice.
4;A good flavored coffee;The name sounded great - chocolate raspberry truffle - but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.
4;Its ok, good but many out there that my husband liked better;Bought it for my husband as a gift.  he liked it but not as much as Tony Roma
3;ehh;What can i say about this..
5;I Lost 25 Pounds and PB2 Helped;I love peanut butter but hate all the calories.  This powder is perfect for adding a dash of flavor to my morning cream of wheat or oatmeal.
5;Very Timely Delivery;They did a very good job with shipping the order quickly..
2;couldn't get the treats out;Neither I nor my dogs could get treats out of this! I shook it and rolled it every which way, nothing came out. It wasn't easy to load, either.
5;Rosemary;From New Orleans use as ingredients for cooking such as red beans and rice.  Use in invocations of protection spells, make essential oils, soaps, natural bath herb crystals, satchels, and other crafts.
5;Cotton Candy;Guh, cotton candy. This was the flavor I most looked forward to, and it's the one I ripped into and gleefully made a cup as soon as the package arrived.
4;Great service, okay baklava;The service was terrific.  Fast, efficient, and communicative.
5;Super convenient;I keep a stock of these for the convenience factor.  Taste is pretty darn good as well.
5;Baby likes it;Our baby likes it more than Enfamil and that s the only thing that matters.<br />We wanted to buy the organic one but a review mentioned that their DHA extraction process contained benzene.
5;Delicious;This is good stuff. I used some to make buckwheat honey butter, some on foods, and some I ate just as honey straws.
5;Yum!;I am a vegan, and it is hard to find a good cocoa that is vegan.  This sipping chocolate is delicious made with soymilk!  You can follow the directions on the package for a 4 oz.
5;It's surprisingly good!;I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing.
5;Great treats!;My vet recommended these for my overweight Scottie.  He loves them and they have helped him lose 4 lbs.
5;A fantastic product for a Peanut Butter lover that needs to cut Calories;I had seen this on Amazon and wanted to order it but was appalled at the shipping +cost of product, but put it in my wish list cart. Later I was at the store and found a different no calorie peanut butter and took it home and tried it and found that it was chemically tasteing and i threw it out.
3;Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be;I thought this would've tasted better than it did. Smelled stronger than it tasted.
1;no treats come out;after the first few treats come out, no more will come out. even I can't get them out!!<br />I have bought buster cubes in the past that have worked fine.
5;The Gold Standard for Pumpkin Pie!;"The best, most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9"" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9"" pies (2 cup volume)."
5;Nice cup of tea!;I am a confirmed tea addict, and I keep a wide selection of regular, flavored, and herbal teas on hand, so the chance to test a new flavor of herbal tea was a no-brainer.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that, though this is an entirely herbal concoction, it has the nice flavor of black tea.
5;Great Product;At the recommendation of my sister, I ordered this product through Amazon and got it within two days on the Prime program.  I Got two bags for less than one I had previous purchased at Wal-Mart.
5;Pretty good;I have to give my yorkie a pill twice a day. I can't give the pills without these since my dog spits the pills out.
5;Ghirardelli chocolate supreme bownies;These are the best brownies I have ever tasted! Perfectly fudgey and oh so deliciously chocolaty. I swirled the fudge onto the top only (instead of mixing it in completely) and loved the results but I'm sure it would have been fabulous as directed as well.
5;Flavorable Tea;Twinings Vanilla Tea is a very flavorable tea.  If you love vanilla, you'll love this tea.
5;Green Mt Keurig, Half Caf;Flavor is fairly good. I got this because sometimes full caf, regular coffee is too much.
5;This Tea is a Must Try;"The flavors of this tea are spicy, rich and complex, but nothing stands out too strong screaming ""this spice is overwhelming.""  When preparing ensure your water is sufficently heated and that you streep the tea for a minimum of 5-10 minutes."
5;Excellent Product;Saw this product on Dr Oz and was not able to find it locally.  It was shipped well protected and the quality and taste was outstanding.
5;Dorkie want a treat;Well my dog seems to like these very much.  Let's see if someone can offer free shipping on these.
5;Finally!;First, let me say ..
5;MMM,MMM, GOOD;"I prefer to eat the ""PINK"" cotton candy and this flavor pink  vanilla is better than great!  You get a lot for your money. My girls also love it!! This is the BEST! When you buy this, I promise you will not be disappointed with this purchase."
4;Big leaves;I haven't had any problems with this tea so I am a notch above indifferent.  I don't regret buying it.
5;AMAZINGLY good tea!!!!!;This is AMAZING tea.  It is very cinnamon-y and spicy, but it is also sweet, not bitter at all.
5;My dog loves them;These are healthy treats, not intended to be a large part of a dog's diet. The ingredients of most of the Wet Noses products are all good for dogs.
4;trigirl;A very enjoyable sweet treat
5;My two cats love Paw Lickin' Chicken;I have two finicky eaters.  They will only eat Paw Lickin' Chicken canned food.
5;Airline cookies;These cookies are served on some airlines. Excellent taste especially with coffee or ice cream
5;Pirate's Booty is the best snack for kids and adults;My husband is a diabetic, my grandchildren are healthy eaters and my 85 year old parents, we all eat Pirate's Booty. It's a great all time, any time snack for all of us.
5;Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea;****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle.
5;SNAILS TO DIE FOR;These snails were great. I thought I was buying wholesale for my business before at $14.
5;Good deal;I don't drink coffee, but I do the shopping.  The price was good and my husband loves the coffee.
5;A substitute for popcorn addicts;I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it I decided to find another source.
5;Delicious;The pickles are extremely delicous.  I finished the jar in about a week and then used the pickle juice to make some pickled eggs.
5;Great healthy treats for the kids;If you were to give your kids a treat, why not offer them the healthiest treat possible.  I've found these lollipops are very tasty for both adults & children.
5;Great Wanchai product;I have purchased several of Wanchai products and all seem to be good.  Only thing you have to buy is the chicken.
4;ZICO;ZICO pure coconut water is a wonderful beverage
5;The Bone That Won't Splinter!;Years ago this bone was recommended to me by the owner of a small pet store. I have a dane/lab mix, Gumbo.
1;They're Not Madhouse Munchies!!!;DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch.
1;Do Not Buy;"I have a 33 pound 8 month old puppy who loves to chew (50% Pomeranian, 50% Australian Shepard). I sure caught the name ""everlasting"" in this product."
5;Different;"Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is different than other ""drizzled"" or dipped or coated popcorn I have tasted in the past.  It seems to have just the right amount of fudge and caramel so as to not turn it into a cookie or on the skimpy side a dusted corn pop."
5;sugar;My husband uses this sugar since he is a diabetic.  He likes it in his coffee and tea.
5;Happy . . .;I do love bold Italian and Spanish espressos ..
4;Great Product But Bad Packaging;Got my McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, but all my cans were dented, and the inflated bags that was suppose to protect the cans were deflated.  One of the cans was opened on the seam.
5;Good product!;I received this product quickly and in excellent condition. No problems at all.
4;Great Sweetner, But Use Sparingly!;I've ordered several bags of this xylitol now and really enjoy it. I must caution that you use it sparingly to see how your digestive system reacts to it.
5;Super Yum!;These were better than I could have ever hoped.  As far as the Weight Watcher plus points goes they are 3 pp.
2;Tiny, gone in a few seconds;These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment.
5;good post-workout snack;This is a great post-workout snack.  As a runner, I burn a lot of calories, so I'm hungry when I finish.
5;Excellent Coffee;Great bold flavor. I love this brand, their French Roast is great as well.
4;Not too sweet;I love the convenience of the single serve pouches and the honey/mango/pineapple flavor is good.  It isn't too sweet or artificial tasting.
5;Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic k-cup;I've been drinking this for quite awhile now and have not been disappointed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, I think you will like this.
1;tastes like paper!;I'm usually impressed with this brand's stevia products, but not with these individually packed ones. These don't taste sweet in the slightest
4;od for you. I enjoy the tastetea;I ordered this tea because Dr Oz said it was good for you.I like the taste .
5;Use this for my Japan Recipe for Sticky rice served with anything;I love this product, My friend who is a associate of mine brought a Dish we all called sticky Rice.<br />We use the Short Grain Rice Product only to put in the Rice Cooker when making this, 2 Cups of Premium SHORT Grain Rice only ( Short Grain Rice is better for you and healthier ) 1/2 Cup of this Mizkan Base into the Rice Cooker along with your 1 and half cups to 2 cups water to cook depending on your taste, When Rice Cooker is finished you can Add a  Bag of Fresh Peas to Blanch Steam in with them and Stir.
5;Great deal - swim fast!;My son has used this product for swimming - since he had his braces put on. He isn't supposed to eat power bars.
5;The best dog treat;Little BITZ chicken treats are the best treats I've found for my little dog. Not only are they good for him but he LOVES them.
2;Somewhat undecided;This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.
1;Yuck!!!;I really hoped that I would like these.  However, I found them to be horrible in taste and texture.
5;PureVia All Natural Zero Calorie Sweetner;Prompt delivery.  Product as described.
5;Mango Passionfruit delight;Wow, this Mango Passionfruit tea is the best herbal teas I have tasted. It is good hot or cold sweetened with a little Agave.
5;MOCAFE SPICED CHAI TEA MIX;My first purchase of this product was made from curiosity. I have been using it for a few years.
5;The best ever!;I grew up with Community Dark Roast in my house!!  But have recently tried just about all of the different roasts & blends.  You have to try Breakfast Blend and Cafe Special.
5;My All-Time Favorite Tully's K-Cup Flavor!;I usually drink Tully's French or Kona, but decided to get this since I had seen some really good reviews on it. It seemed like a lot of people were buying it, so I wanted to find out why.
2;Bad Batch?;We've had several other brands of seaweed snacks and always enjoyed them.<br />I loved the cute, kid-friendly packaging on these, the all natural ingredients, and the flavor options.
5;Star Wars Lego themed 5 yr old Bday pty;these lego look alike's are terrific and very tasty.  the candy is very hard but delicious and no sticky mess.
4;Hmmm...;The Venus flytraps come in a little plastic baggy with a wet tissue wrapped around it at the roots so that it doesn't dry out. It also comes with some moss and instructions on how to set up the Venus flytraps as stated.
5;THE BEST! WOW!;Popcorn PERFECTION! When they say it's premium popcorn they aren't kidding! High quality popcorn with outstanding flavor. The cheese pack is GREAT! Outstanding real cheese flavor without that cheap acidic taste.
5;Puppy Approved!;I have three dogs, all relatively small. While they have no problem handling the size, I don't want them eating such a big quantity all at once.
5;Perfect if you're trying to stay away from caffeine;I got this tea as a gift after delivering my baby. It's perfect if you're trying to stay away from caffeine.
2;Okay alternative, but too sweet!;I was looking for a way to cut back on calories and sugar. The first sip tasted pretty good, but after a few more it is just too sweet.
5;Delicious product - WAY OVERPRICED ON AMAZON;This product tastes just like regular peanut butter. It is great on protein shakes for an extra boost of protein.
5;Great product!;I am sorry but the below reviewer is absolutely talking non-scence. I have 7 cats and 8 bags of these in my cabinets but I have gone days on end without giving these to ANY of my cats and they are absolutely fine.
2;Disappointed. . .;I do enjoy Hazelnut flavored creamers as well as french vanilla creamers in my coffee, I know the flavors aren't exact but  since I enjoyed them in coffee I might like them in cappuccino as well.  I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.
3;Very hot, but you are guaranteed heartburn;If you want the hottest chip available, its right here.  Taste is pretty good, but it is overwhelmed by the heat.
5;Creamy & Rich. The Best Chocolates Around!;I have been receiving these chocolates from my significant other for years now. Every holiday I get a new assortment.
1;Contains MSG!;I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate.
5;tasty Maybe beneficial;My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters.
5;Good Price(?);I love the coffee and was looking to get a good deal on Amazon. My local supermarket sells the coffee for $6.
1;Still not here;I purchased this coffee on 11/4, and as 12/14 I have not received the product.  I would not recommend this seller.
5;A great treat that's made in the U.S.A.;I am new to dog training but I learned real quick that they will respond much better if they love the treats. Our dog really loves these and they are just the right size for training.
5;Jelly Belly Knows Flavor;We recently bought a snow cone machine for my daughter.  I wanted to join in the fun, but I have been on a low-carb diet for almost 2 years.
5;"Family declared the batch I made with this ""the best loaf ever made""";I've been playing with bread recipes for about a year now, both by hand and in our bread maker. After really getting in to studying the science behind a good loaf, I began buying wheat gluten.
5;Best suited for those who like black tea blends.;I really LOVE this tea. I drink a LOT of black tea each day since I don't drink coffee.
5;Great product handling;I am extremely satisfied with the product supplied and the shipping and handling. Everything turned out great.
4;Good;"I was so excited to find these!  My son, who has celiac, had long been jealous that his friends could make mac-n-cheese in the microwave whenever they wanted, but he could not due to his sensitivity.  He says they are just as good as ""regular"" mac-n-cheese."
2;Where is the Bergamot flavor??;"I was expecting a lot more from a tea that is named ""Double Bergamot"". Some other Earl Grey's I have used have more Bergamot flavoring in 1 tea bag then this little tea in 4."
1;Terrible;"I cannot stand the taste of this ""cinnamon"". It doesn't list the kind of cinnamon used on its packaging so I question it's true origins."
5;Tasty and Healthy;I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast. That is, unless of course, there's donuts or pancakes.
4;Please, sir -- may I have some more?;Most of the carbonated juice drinks I've tried have either been far too sweet, far too carbonated, or just plain nasty.  So I tried The Switch with more than a little trepidation.
4;Good Coffee - Great Price;"I caught this as a ""Warehouse"" deal. $18."
5;Sticky and Sweet;Wholesome Sweeteners is one sweet company. They are a fair trade company,and believe in justly compensating their employees,as well as care for their environment.
5;Perfect for babies who want to be social!;I started giving these to my 7 month old daughter because every time her 2 1/2 year old brother had something to eat she looked at his food longingly. She loves them and blazes through them pretty fast.
5;yum;I tried this tea once and for the longest time could not find it again.<br />Once found, i could not resist getting it.
5;Phenomenal Substitute for Peanut Butter;The day of writing this, I found out I am gluten- (and egg!) intolerant.<br /><br />Before any of these findings, however, I had switched to Sunbutter a few months ago, and bought the 6-pack here on Amazon.
1;Gone in 20 min;I have a 2 year old small rottweiler mix. When i bought this toy she was just shy of 1 1/2  and was chewing through everything so after chewing through our third red kong in the matter of a month I was getting desperate and decided to try the everlasting treat ball.
4;DOES NOT GROW MOLD AT ALL IF USED PROPERLY!;This machine does not grow mold at all if you just use some common sense and follow the included care directions.  Immediately after use, you just un-cap the reservoir and pour out any remaining water.
5;No substitute for fresh ground pods, but inexpensive for quick beverages;"When I am making chai or Turkish coffee for friends I always grind whole pods (a quality product is <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Daughter likes it & very healthy!;I have an 18 month old who only has 4 teeth. Needless to say, she still eats a lot of pureed foods.
4;Like it...;Yum. What doesn't go well with Sriracha? Yeah, you can buy this pretty much anywhere nowadays, but I live up in the hills and I'd rather stuff come to me.
1;wrong item;i have ordered love crunch - dark chocolate and red berries, yet i received aloha blend. well, my sweetheart likes it but i am not happy because i received the wrong item.
4;Nice low carb product;Being on Atkins, I needed to find a low carb bread since most bread is not compatible with the low carb diet.  This product has a reasonable taste and texture and I will be buying more.
4;Lasts a long time;Got these for my two papillon pups who are always looking for something to get into/destroy.  They love their Ziggies and Lobos but they fly through them so fast - they're gone in under 5 minutes!  I wanted something that would keep them busy for a while.
5;Tasted great!!;Love this product. I use it to make salad dressings that are low in sugar and calories.
5;the best jasmine tea;I've tried other brands of jasmine tea, and none is as good.  This is just delicious tea, doesn't go stale quickly (ie, will last on your shelf for several years if you go in and out of tea-drinking phases), and reminds me of being in Montreal because so many of the restaurants in the Chinatown area serve it.
3;Packaging Needs Better Instructions;This brown rice vermicelli is okay.  The taste and texture is very similar to the Thai Kitchen Original Pad Thai noodles I've used before, but these do seem somewhat healthier.
3;Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillet Helps Create a Simple Meal;A simple meal is often welcome when your working life takes up a good portion of your day and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger offers exactly that. It contains the basic ingredients in a box, ready to prep and serve with minimal effort or culinary skill.
5;Cheese;We use this product to make a tasty cheese butter for baked potatoes. It is very hard to find in local superrmarkets, so when I found it on-line, I puchased it.
5;Great and Very Fresh;This is a really tasty collection.  I wasn't sure about the cookies and cream, but the white chocolate has a lot of flavor.
2;Yuck!;The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture.  It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.
5;dog friendly food;this graiin-free food changed my dog's life for the better.  his system with dog food containing meat by-products and grain was stressed.
2;Dissapointed.. NOT Chewy;Was excited to find a product that worked to prevent bladder blockages.  My cat was excited when I opened the package, the smell alone had him jumping all over me.
5;Amazing Taste!;Purchased this bar along with the almond bars.  Both were amazing and I will purchase again.
5;Best Peach Tea Available;Though I'm a peach tea connoisseur and I've tried many brands over the years, St. Dalfour  is the best.
2;Pretty Bad;I do most of my own baking, but I decided to order these out of curiosity. They all ended up in the trash.
5;Tastes Great!;I bought these for my special needs son so that he could have a variety of flavors.  We can only buy the vanilla and chocolate in stores, but no one carries the strawberry.
5;Superb!;I developed a liking for butter toffee peanuts when I was on vacation in Michigan one year.  Up there they are available in the nut aisle of pretty much any grocery store.
3;Skeptical because of cost.....;I hardly ever even buy bottled water because I am cheap!  $22 bucks for 12 bottles?  Why not squeeze your own fruit flavor in some filtered water if that's all it is?  Sometimes I freeze lime juice or lemon juice in ice cube trays and pour water over that..
2;Eh.... doesn't fool me;This doesn't really taste like a Mojito on its own - perhaps if you used it as a non-calorie mixer. Adding alchol would add colories.
5;Yum!;These are so good, when I first bought them I thought they would be more like granola clusters but they are actually little round flat 'chips' that are very good for you. Packed with all kinds of healthy stuff, my kids have no idea they are eating healthy and getting some of their daily fiber! I eat mine with yogurt in the morning and it helps keep me full until lunch.
5;Very tasty;I dilute the cereal just with plain water and it still tastes pretty good. My baby loves it.
1;Couldn't be any worse;These tasted like molasses and preservatives. This is how close to being okay it was: I ate one piece and then threw out every bag.
5;Van Houtte chocolage rasberry  K-Cup;This coffee has a wonderful aroma.  I usually don't drink coffee with cream and sugar but I like this particular flavor better with a little cream and sugar.
5;my wife wanted them;my wife wanted these laughing cow light blue cheese's but could not find them in any of the stores near home.<br />so me being the dutiful husband and OTR truck driver i happened to notice them in a Meijers store in Illinois, so of course i picked up a couple for her and put them in my cooler, she was so pleased when i called her.
5;good powder with chennai flavor;I have used this for some time and the sambar comes out tasting good. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to cook sambar quickly and easily.
2;Bought based on reviews ... no more;We picked these up based on the glowing reviews. My fault, my mistake.
5;Love my flytrap!;The seller definitely cares about the plants sold, he contacted me to let me know around when they'd be there and what to do when they arrived. The package came with thorough, easy-to-follow instructions and the plants.
5;Happy first time eater!;Hello all from a sunny morning on an island in Maine. Had Weefulls for the first time this morning, in the waffle fashion.
3;Food Writer;I was writing on candy and it tended to run out every so often. I kept having to switch pens.
5;Dessert Tea!;This is a terrific dessert alternative.  Without all the calories, I get my chocolate fix & my sweet ending.
5;great;i will order this product again when i run out.Great price,resonable shipping time,great taste and enough to last a few months.
5;Super Gummi Cola, Super Taste & Super Savings!;First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy.
5;Who doesn't love Chef Boyardee?;Convenient and tasty. Pop it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap, and microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
5;HIMALAYAN SEA SALT;The Spice Lab is a completely wonderful company!!!<br />I received my order promptly. The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.
5;Peaceful Thoughts...;"""A single cup of Tazo Calm has been known to have the same effect as sitting for 45 minutes in a mountain meadow on a sunny day with your shoes off."" ~tea packet<br /><br />Drinking this particular tea blend almost begs for 32 ounces of water."
4;Great cookies!;I absolutely love these cookies. I bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite I fell in love.
5;Excellent;I have tried all the flavors, except coffee & cookies & cream.  And the maple vanilla is is one of my top 2 favorites (the other is the pumpkin).
5;Flavor;When I was on the HCG protocol, this was a life saver.  It puts flavor where you need it most for the best price.
5;Absolutely LOVE these!  Handy, healthy, fantastic flavor!;Like another reviewer, I became familiar with Oloves in a snack pack during a flight.  Ever since I have selected the snack pack to get the olives.
4;Less Mess, Less Fuss;These puffs are our go to trip food.  They're not too messy and they taste fresh and not too sweet.
4;After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.;My household has this tea stocked up at all times..
5;Great for summer salads;A great penne pasta that substitutes well for traditional wheat penne in hot or cold recipes.  The price was competitive.
5;Natural Treats;
4;cajun coffee??;Never tasted any of the cajun coffee but this is what it must taste like.  The coffee is beyond strong, more like 2 shots of espresso.
4;not bad;So far so good. My dog seems to love this things.
5;The Wonders of Fresh Fiocchetti Pasta;"For those of us lucky enough to have eaten at Quattro Leoni, a great neighborhood restaurant on the ultra Arno in Florence, there is a menu item we always return for - the pear and ricotta filled fiocchetti (""little purse"") pasta in taleggio cream saunce with asparagus.  It is absolutely divine."
5;Merrick is one of the best...;I come from generations of veterinarians, vet technicians and professional dog trainers and breeders. Proper nutrition equals fewer vet visits and fewer lower vet bills.
5;Excellent convenience;Very satisfied.  It was delivered earlier than expected.
5;Gevalia Crema T-Discs;We received a Tassimo coffee machine for Christmas, and are enjoying the convience and taste of these wonderful T-Disc.  My wife really enjoys the lattes and this is a convenient way to enjoy one.
3;Hazelnut Flavor;The Hazelnut flavor was very weak and the coffee was a little bitter.<br /><br />I have tried other coffees by Timothy's World and was happy with those.
4;outside critters are eating it;I have been feeding abandoned cats..
3;Great snack, but girls didn't like this one as much.;My girls liked the Ernie (pear/mango) ones better.  I got both, and no one wanted the Elmo ones.
5;very good!;I live in Japan (for now) and this is the rice that always sells out the most at our local store and I have to buy it in 20lb bags for my house but the price on here is high. But it is worth it.
4;pretty good but if you really love sardines...;the fillets are very white, very clean (no skin, no bones), very mild. the olive oil is straw-colored and mild.
5;"Super ""MUST HAVE"" product for your baby!";Our daughter is now 1 yrs old and loves this!  We mix it into everything she eats so that she gets the added DHA and vitamins since she is now off from formula.  I highly recommend this to any parent.
5;Great energy bar;These bars are fantastic- I love how they are not overly sweet like every other bar I've tasted ie luna and cliff bars. I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache.
3;gustafs red licorice;The red licorice has a lot of flavour but is too soft. They also have a grape version which is much better and firmer.
3;Human food but apparently not cat food;It looks and smells really good. It has no harmful additives.
4;Romaine Salad Seed Kit;I received kit as expected. It was on time with no problems.
5;Wonderful tea;Great product, fresh, quick shipping. I will buy again.
1;Makes babies constipated!;Wrongful advertisement! I usually don't write any reviews but I had to give this one a star. Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated.
5;Rice oil;The rice oil is awesome and I love it use it on everything . Would buy again .
3;Keep it simple;Just to keep it simple..
2;Not what I had hoped for;This tea is okay but not what I had hoped for.  Seems as though low quality tea leaves were used as there is a definite lack of depth to the flavor.
5;A great product!;We've been using these for years, and always have two cases in each car. We've used them for taking medicine, mixing formula, washing hands, and drinking (of course.
4;Good food.for friends!;It is fairly expensive but the dogs love it. Appears to be the real deal nutritionally.
5;Works Great;I used this in my Gluten Free baking and it works great!  For St. Patty's day I made my niece Gluten Free Irish Soda Bread using Gluten Free A P Flour, adding 2 teaspoons per cup of flour used and it came out tasting just like the regular bread.
4;Unique flavor;This jerky piqued my interest.  Maple pepper? I had to try it and it did not disappoint.
5;FAVORITE COFFEE;I have used Millstone coffee for years and when they took it out of stock at my store, I could not find a satisfactory substitute.  That's when I decided to look on Amazon.
5;Excellent Product;Just started my older dog on this and she LOVES this food.  And I must say, it LOOKS and SMELLS good to me (not stinky like some dog food).
5;Now lower price - but same great quality!;I love these little tomatoes. They are a specialty from southern Italy, growing at the foot of the Vesuvio.
5;Wonderful Escape From American Cuisine;We loved the Soy Ginger Saba Noodles. Absolutely not too spicy.
5;Healthy Nuts;I eat a lot of raw nuts, of all kinds. Pecans are the most fatty but so delicious.
4;My finicky dog actually likes these!;My dog, Sara, is very particular about her food and treats.  She will only eat high quality canned foods and 100% meat treats.
5;Knock out punch;It has a strong flavor and its a little different but if you want something to relax you for the evening and put you over the edge..
2;Warning: Contains Sucralose;"I kept getting this weird taste in my mouth after having this ""no sugar added"" hot cocoa. I finally took a look at the ingredients and saw that they are using sucralose to sweeten it."
5;Toss-up winner between Big Hunk and Snickers;Used to eat this candy back in the mid 1960s as a little kid, and had not eaten one since until 2010.  Wow, nice that the Internet has solved one of life's little mysteries, as Big Hunk lives on!  Great taste, and unlike my other favorite candy which is Snickers, one can't wolf down a Big Hunk in a few blinks of an eye.
5;Great afternoon tea with full flavor;Once again I'm thrilled with Davidson's! I've ordered three pounds of tea and each one is as delicious as the next. Who would't want a tastier and cheaper alternative to bagged tea?<br /><br />Looks pretty in a glass container, loose.
5;A Healthy, Yet Tasty, Snack;These little cookies are healthy, each one having under 50 calories and very little sugar. Eating two for an afternoon snack provides nourishment without overloading a moderate diet.
5;cat food;its cat food that was offered at a good price..
2;Rotten?;OUr first order came and it was pate, which is not what i was expecting. Some can's has fungus in them? Weird.
1;Dreadful;Made it in a bread maker. Followed directions.
5;the best out there;This product is the best I have found yet.  It is so universal you can use it as breading for fish or chicken and make all kinds of breads with it.
5;This stuff is addictively good;If you've ever had those free cookies (Biscoff cookies) on a Delta flight, you'll know what these taste like (if you haven't, you seriously need to try one next time you're on Delta). This is the spread version (basically they just take biscoff cookies and pulverize them), and it's absolutely delicious! The flavor is a little hard to try, you've just got to try it.
5;Great chips and a great rpice!;Got my first order of these last week and have ordered four more for friends who keep raving about them! I usually buy these sort of chips at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price and convenience of ordering from Amazon can't be beat. These chips have a great flavor to them and arrived in perfect condition.
5;My cockapoo puppy loves these!;My pup, Miltie, is 7.5 months old and so far he's not tired of the Zuke's treats at all, and he's had them since the first month I brought him home.
4;Clif crunch bars;Love the peanut butter crunch bars.  Normally buy them at Walmart for 3.
5;Great product, bad price;We bought these for travel since the hotels only give you stale dry creamer.  These are great but I found them at Sams Club for a little over $7 for 188 ct.
5;Love this flour;This is a great GF flour, use it in place of white flour.  Only thing I noticed is sometimes you need to add more than a 1:1 ratio in recipes calling for wheat flour to get the stiffness you need.
5;Currently my power chewer's very favorite Nylabone...;..
5;Great gum!;This is my husband's favorite gum.  It reminds him of the Apollo astronauts of the 1960's.
5;Still the best;"I've tried a lot of different beef jerky products, including <a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Not what I expected.;I'm pretty sure this is just brown sugar. It is not like Sucanat.
5;Rich Taste and Texture;I bought this as a father's day gift.  He absolutely loved it.
5;yummy and filling;loooove this stuff! I am ordering my 3rd case this month. It tastes amazing and it's good for you.
4;Chewy;These have the best taste of white cheddar popcorn I've ever had, they are just a little too chewy to be really good. If you don't mind the chewiness of them you will like them.
1;Poisonous to Dogs;my dog is hospitalized with severe hypoglycemia and with poor prospects of survival.  One of the biggest causes of this in pets is food with Xylitol in it.
2;Good idea, yet overpriced;For the price, these things are overpriced I think.  Sure they are healthy and look cool, but that comes at a price.
4;Big Hit With Our Pooches;Piper and Gabby received some Smart Bones for Christmas. Little Gabby had never had a chew this large and neither had ever had a Smart Bone, so we didn't know what to expect.
5;Tastes oh so good;I love these breakfast nuts, I eat a bag every morning as I don't spend a lot of time in the mornings before I leave for work.<br /><br />My girlfriend loves the other flavors w/ apple slices, but this is my favorite flavor.
5;Very good;I bought this based on reviews.  It really seems to work.
5;Tea sampler;I have been using loose leaf tea since the 80s when a friend brewed some South American black tea and it was amazing.<br />My review will be for unsweetened iced tea as I steep and pour over ice at work in an attempt to wean myself from colas.
5;Excellent, AMERICAN MADE, nothing imported;"I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called ""made here."
2;Too lemony;This Creme Bouquet was not like any I have used in the past. The lemon flavor was overwhelming and I could not taste any other flavor.
5;Delicious!;Living with Celiac Disease can be tricky when I'm away from home, but at home it's not so bad.  I was never a big fan of bread or other baked goods - I seem to have instinctively avoided them my whole life.
5;Just like I remembered them as a kid!;I used to play with and chew these gum cigarettes as a kid (I grew up in the 80's). These are exactly like the ones we had then.
4;Yum;I don't know what the old Planters was like but this is delicious.  It has a good peanutty taste without a lot of extra sugar and salt.
5;Organic, wholesome baby crack;This is my nine month old daughter's first yogurt, and to say that she loved it would be an understatement. She went crazy for it.
2;Crumbs - Product was not as ordered;I ordered cookies, but I received crumbs. I don't enjoy eating my cookies with a spoon.
5;Love these;I love these little tetra paks of coconut milk. They have no guar gum, and because they aren't in BPA lined cans, I am happy.
5;other uses;I don't eat this as a cereal.  I really like it on salad as a substitute for croutons.
3;Heavenly Soup with Too Much Salt.;Absolutely delicious soup.  Love the macaroni that has been added.
5;Perfect size for me;I wanted a smaller morter & pestle for small jobs. This one is perfect and the red marble is a pleasure to have on my counter.
5;Five stars and an Eight paw Salute;Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty.
5;yum, yum;one of my favorite flavors.  The tutti fruitti is also delicious.
5;Excellent;This Rishi loose teas are excellent.  This one in particular has a very unique flavor.
4;Great buy;I had bought this as a gift for several people, and I have consistently received good reviews.  Personally, I would prefer to have the cinnamon flavor a notch higher.
1;Unexpectedly flat taste (in a dented can);Usually, organic food tastes sweeter and is more tender than food with preservatives and bug spray in them.  This lot of Westbrae organic corn I bought from Amazon tasted oddly flat:  very little flavor.
5;Excellent;People seem to get EXTRACT and PURE OIL confused. Alcohol has to be added because it literally brings the flavor out of the small quantity of peppermint leaves that were actually used.
5;It doesn't seem like it should work.... but it does.;I was skeptical of this when I came across it at FreshDirect.  I mean .
3;Gorgonzola dolce;It lacks the salt that Gorgonzola offers in its alternative version. Eating it by itself was too bland, for me.
5;Great Big Jar of Red Pepper !!!;Such value for the money.  You don't realize how big a 22-ounce jar is until you have it open in front of you.
5;Great product.;Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally.
3;High quality but not my favorite;This is a high quality tea.  I tried it because my grocery store was out of Twining's oolong and it stated on the box if you like oolong try DarJeeling.
1;Diarrhea 2 for 2;Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea.
5;Best dog food;I have been buying this dog food for more than three years. It has been the best for both of my dogs.
5;A combo that could bring world peace;Imagine..
5;Spicy Goodness;I had tried these when I brought them from my local asian store and fell in love with them. So I thought why not just buy a whole box.
5;Love this rawhide!;I bought this for my Siberian Husky, who is a heavy chewer.  It has been very well tolerated by her and doesn't come off in chunks.
3;Drink it.;This soup is great just a bit salty. A like it otherwise.
4;Great for Camping!;This product is perfect for camping trips! I discovered these while on a camping/roadtrip to Yellowstone.  We traditionally have family pizza night on Sat.
4;very hot;Hotter than I expected.  Not much pepper flavor but great for adding heat to anything.
5;YUMMY!;YUMMY! I love how this item is individually packaged. The box (outer box) was very easy to open.
2;Peach Tea;"We found very little peach flavor in this ""peach tea"".  It is a poor substitute for Twinings."
1;Horribly disappointed;I bought these from Costco when they no longer carried my favorite gummy snacks and even my kids won't eat them.  They have an awful texture and the taste, well they just taste horribly artifical.
5;Loco for Cocoa Roast Almonds;These fantastic dry-roasted almonds offer up all the chocolate-y taste of dipped almonds, thanks to their generous dusting of cocoa powder, without any of the higher-fat guilt.  Nice crunch with a hint of salty-sweetness (or would that be sweet-saltiness?)  We recently served them at a dinner party and everybody couldn't stop talking about how great they were.
5;A True Find!;This stuff is truly amazing..
1;WISH I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO;This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out.
4;only a hint of flavour;Been a fan of Stash teas, but I never ventured into the flavored teas. I am always affraid of the flavor taking over the tea part of it.
5;Takes some sdjusting;"I was really looking forward to this Einkorn spaghetti. I'm trying to totally eliminate ""modern"" FrankenWheat from my diet."
4;Good basic coffee for your Keurig;This is pretty good coffee at a very reasonable price compared with other Keurig coffees.  I liken it more to Dunkin coffee than Starbucks.
5;A rememberance of the Wailana Coffee House;My wife and I had fond memories of having a GREAT breakfast with this syrup in Honolulu for many years.  The Wailana Coffee House was the place to get this syrup and it brings back pleasant memories of the island.
5;Tasty Cookies;Very good product.  They are a tasty animal cookie with just the right sweetness.
2;Bad Sauce;The pasta is delicious, but the sauce is nasty.  Very bitter and little cheese flavor.
2;I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half;I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half.
5;Lovely green tea;This tea is really tasty.  The taste is really difficult to describe, but it is lemony, minty, and sweet all at the same time!  None of the flavors dominate, but all work together to produce a really unique taste.
5;It works for me;I like to drinks this instead of coffee and it keeps me awake about the same. I like my coffee but the side effects I don't care for.
5;Henri's Salad Dressing;If you are from the midwest, this was probably on the dinner table.  Hard to find in grocery stores elsewhere.
3;Here's the chips;I tried the multigrain chips without any dip or cheese.  The flavors were minimally pleasant and reminded me of the chips on airlines flights when the choice is chips or pretzels.
5;Best loose black tea;I really like this tea in loose form.  I brew it by the pot, leave the loose tea in the pot and strain out the tea.
1;DO NOT ORDER;@ ONE QUARTER OF THE ITEMS ARRIVED LEAKING..
5;Really good green tea;If you like green tea you need to try this one. A Japanese friend introduced me to this style of tea with the roasted rice over 30 years ago and I have had some in my tea stash ever since.
5;One of the best flavored K-cups I've tried;Often with coffee in general, and especially k-cups in my experience, flavors don't work too well. I was ordering a book and needing to get to over $25 for free shipping when I spotted these in my Quick Picks section and went ahead and added them to my order.
5;Great Mint;I would buy some in a store to see if you like them.  I do and the price was better on here.
5;These are amazing!;I've tried all the flavors but the Original is by far my favorite.  Ordered these through the Popchips website and it routed me to Amazon.
5;So worth the price!;This stuff is AMAZING!  $16 a jar seems steep..
2;explain to me;i am looking to buy these in bulk.  my dog loves them  however, $10 for this tiny bag is ridiculous.
5;The office loves their treat!!!;These are great for the office, evryone loves them. They are the best tasting quick snack for a busy office.
5;Another Husband Favorite;Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school.  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so.
3;Underwhelming;I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn't taste like much.  The organic cocoa powder doesn't seem to mix well, and the hemp.
4;Solid mass of Coconut Love;Coconut Oil, as I found out, remains a solid when it is not in its native tropical environment (70+ degrees or so). I also found out that this oil is rather less expensive at international foods section of the local supermarket.
5;Awesome;I love this tea. I hated my friends asking me if I was pregnant.
5;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT;I have been buying this product from Costco for years. My mother in law introduced me to this product and she had been buying them for years before that.
5;oh yummmm;"My little one likes to eat another brand of ""organic fruit chews"". I think they're just ok."
5;Perfect summer tea;this is the best iced green tea I've ever had
5;Doesn't upset little tummies;I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset.
5;i really don't want to rave but...;this product is pretty phenomenal. i really don't want other people to buy it since i honestly don't want to share, but the truth is that it's really great.
2;Not satisfied;Quite disappointed. The pills don't last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works.
2;Fresh Whole Rabbit NOT alive;Fresh Whole Rabbit was DOA. After calling Cloverdale customer service the matter was cleared up.
3;If it looks good, is it good for the cats?;My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.
1;photoshop at its finest;I bought these thinking they would at least be somewhat like the picture and the noodles would be thick (like pad thai noodles..
5;Favorite Hot Sauce x4!;What's better than a bottle of Tabanero? Four bottles! Believe me, I use this stuff faster than I ever would have imagined and a single bottle only lasts 1 to 2 weeks. How do I put this nicely? Hrm, .
5;Thank you, Natural Calm!;I have only taken this magnesium product for three days
5;Hot Cocoa K-cups;I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.
4;Nice Cup That's a Little Stronger - But Not Too Strong;"If you're looking for what I consider a true ""bold"" cup of coffee, I think you are going to be disappointed and may want to try <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;the only peanut butter i'll ever eat;So good..
5;dream come true!;I am on a severely limited carb diet plus have wheat and gluten allergies but love pasta and really miss it.  These are a dream come true for me.
5;stash peach tea;This tea is hard to find so I bought 6 boxes. When you open the packet, the bag smells exactly like fresh peaches.
1;poor packaging and customer service;We purchased this product and the ziplock seals did not function, so there was no way to reseal the package after opening.  We tried to contact every single email address on their website and nobody at that company thought it was important enough to respond.
5;A Great Cup of Joe: A Saeco Vienna Plus Super-Automatic Espresso Machine Review;We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.
5;Empty Bowl Every Time;I will admit, I have forced my cat to eat all kinds of varieties of cat foods so as to make him not too picky, but this formula is by far his favorite dry food.  The other grain-free brand I tried was Wellness, and he only picked at that.
4;Loved it;My 18+ month old enjoys this food very much. The texture is fine for him and he finished a whole packet.
2;Very Colorful...Not Very Tasty;Tasting a dab of this on a fingertip wasn't too pleasing: it felt too rich, too fake, and too underspiced (basically thousand island dressing with a slight aftertaste of chipotle).<br /><br />So I tried adding it to some food, and in most cases I couldn't even tell it was in there - with the exception that my burrito made orange drips on the plate.
5;Perfect blend;I've always hated the Peete's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste. This is a great blend, still strong without the burn roasting.
5;Great tasting;The taste is really good - I do love coconut, but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower. It helps with my heartburn as well.
5;Tasty, healthy snack;This is a great snack! It tastes great and it's healthy and tasty --a nice alternative to nuts and dried fruits--perfect for tossing into a backpack before a hike, watching the game, or for an on-the-go snack. The 8-packs will tide me over until there's a family-size pack available.
1;Problem Dog Food;I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.
5;Wonderful!;After seeing the Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar lay around the kitchen for a couple of weeks, I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  It was so delicious.
4;Fuel!;These bars keep me going all afternoon
5;An exquisite cookie!;Mother's Cookies have been around forever here on the west coast.  I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).
4;Refreshing coffee substitute;Our family wanted a tasteful coffee substitute to enjoy both in the morning and in the evening.  With Dandy Blend we have solved both dilemma's.
5;Product GREAT, shipping options BAD!;You will not be disappointed by any of the LT.'s products as long as you measure the ingredients before adding to the bag.
5;better size ravioli;in the 14 oz cups the ravioli is a little too big.  you have to cut them in half or constantly wipe sauce off the corners of your mouth.
5;Yummy white buttons -- very fresh;I love the way these buttons melt in my mouth.  I like to pop three or four in at a time and enjoy the creamy white chocolate.
5;I really like this!;Everyone's tastes are different and I didn't expect to like this after reading some of the reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised and glad I tried it.
5;I always come back to this tea;I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all.
5;Cats Love It;This is the first low cal dry cat food my cats will actually eat. In the past I've wasted my money on other brands.
5;to each their own;so first off, i'm not going to pretend that i'm not a RHONJ fan, i am. i also would like to state that although i learned about blk from the show i DID NOT try it to bag a Manzo boy.
2;Don't waste your money.;"This ""batter"" did not cook all the way through, leaving the center doughy and gross. You are better off making it from scratch, it is faster and the end result is better."
5;Great quality;These seeds are supposed to be great for a queasy stomach and so far have worked for me.  The quality is high in this particular brand.
5;Eggcellent Product!;This egg protein is great!<br />First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.<br />Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.
5;Smooth with hints of spice;"I love this K-Cup. I like the ""non-burnt"" tasting, light coffee and this one does that."
2;Strong Branding, Weak Flavor;I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager.
5;Great Value and Flavor;I have been very pleased with the taste and value of the Melitta Medium Roast.  I was a Senseo Kona drinker, but I can no longer find the product.
4;Puppy Food;We used this product for our puppy's first year.  She never had an issue with any type of adverse reaction and seemed to enjoy it very much.
5;Less waste, great taste, go for it!;Our family really likes this brand of coffee.  The package the coffee by the dozen in plastic bags to ensure freshness and the taste is a mild to medium flavor.
3;Great deal for Organic cat dry food! However...;I've bought the smaller package of the same cat food at the store before. It was kind of expensive but I wanted to keep buying organic food for my beloved kitty.
4;Good but not from the same mountain;If you are looking for something that tastes just like mountain dew, then look elsewhere.  However, this soda is refreshing and tasty.
2;NOT worth the money;Like most commercial dog foods, Eukanuba is mostly garbage, full of by- products, fillers and grains that dogs do not need for health. While this is certainly not the worst dog food out there, it is far from the best and absolutely not worth anywher near the price it commands.
4;Tasty;These almonds are the best. I love the tasted but was not quite as zippy or strong as I had hoped.
3;Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice;I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her.
5;a hint of blueberry;Wild Mountain Blueberry is a wonderful tasting coffee..
5;Very good alternative to sugar.;I have tried many of the no sugar sweeteners out there. I find this to be the best.
5;Best coconut water I've had outside of Asia. Price on AMZN is too much. Whole Foods has it for less than 20 bucks a case.;Best coconut water I've had outside of Asia. Price on AMZN is too much.
5;good popcorn;I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing.
1;Not two pounds;When you order a two-pound box you expect two pounds.  This is only 25 ounces.
1;Strawberry POPCORN!! Go figure!;I just bought this at the store trying to get my cheesy snack and both my wife and I thought it had a taste of a greasy strawberry with a hint of butter.  HORRIBLE.
5;Good quality;Difficult to find up here in the mountains, whole coriander seed is excellent for marinating pork, steaks, etc.  Good quality and the right price.
2;To sweet!;These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit.  I was expecting a chewy, tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead.
5;Wonderful!!;My 15 year-old cat was on a special diet for digestive problems and she also has diabetes.  When she stopped eating her usual special-formula food, I tried about 10 different kinds of catfood, and this was the only one she liked.
3;Okay coffee;I have this coffee. It is not the best coffee I ever had.
5;I can't believe this is Michael Keaton!!!;Beetlejuice is truly a work of art!<br />A bit funny, a bit creepy..
5;Great Grain;"My family calls me ""One who eats sticks & twigs"", so they'd say my tastes may not match yours.<br />That having been said, I have always liked Quinoa."
2;Not What I Expected;"I thought this was going to be a REAL cookbook with more than 20 recipes in what looks to be a ""handout"" or ""brochure"" type looking paper book. In perusing it, there are a few good recipes, but I was a bit disappointed in that I thought it was going to be more."
5;My dogs love these!;I have two Westies and a Maltese. We tried many brands of canned food that they didn't like before we found Cesar's.
3;Not worth the money;I like to taste many different flavors, and I particularly like this pack because it has the Sour Cream & Onion in it.<br />But, I like to make my money worth more than anything.
5;Like the product.;I am pleased with the Ken's Italian Dressing. I have been for years.
4;Great product and service, but did not work for me.;I read some of the reviews and could not figure why this product or service got negative reviews.<br /><br />I bought Vita Coco in stores several times and liked everything about it.
5;Awesome chai tea;Tried this new tea on a whim and I absolutely love it. It has all of the appeal of chai tea with a more mellow flavor and a hint of vanilla.
1;My dogs won't eat this!;My dogs love the Dogswell supplements made from chicken, so I assumed they'd also like the sweet potato supplements.  Neither of them would eat it!  Even my aggressive chewing lab didn't like these.
2;I don't give a hoot about Van Houtte;I tried several brands and definitely prefer the Green Mountian brand over Van Houtte, Gloria Jeans, or Coffee People.  I suggest someone new to K cups to get the smallest samples of each brand and decide for yourself before buying any in quantity.
5;My son loved this one!;I have tried a couple other plum organic flavors with my 11 month old. He has never refused any of them and eats the whole thing! But I must say he could not get enough of this flavor he learned how to suck ever last drop out of this bottle! Lol!! I love these for traveling.
5;Buster loves these!;Buster is a recovering shelter dog, and a little picky in his eating sometimes. I've tried a lot of food/treats, and some things he won't eat at all or is allergic to.
3;Good, but not great;I finally got the chance to try these & I have to say they're not bad. They're just not as great as I was hoping, unfortunately.
5;Garvey's Carmel Coffee cake reminds me of my grandmothers;Garvey's Carmel Walnut coffee cake reminds me of the coffee cake my grandmother used to bake. Super easy to make, and always turns out perfect.
5;great product;Excellent healthy treat. I have lost over 30 pounds and owe my success in part to kashi cereal.
1;would not purchase again;I am a huge fan of the betty crocker fudge brownies which always turn out incredible, but these were a disaster.  I cooked them in an 8x8 glass pan just like it said, and they were still completely uncooked in the middle after 50 minutes.
5;No butter Needed!;This is the best microwaveable popcorn I've ever tasted, and I taste every kind I can find.  The natural flavor gives the hint of nutty and buttery and all the flavor I thought I remembered as a kid on movie night.
5;SImply awesome;Absolutely love this product. Sprinkle on chicken throw in the oven comes out with the best flavor ever.
4;More Yummy Kindness;I love this product! I love the strength of the coconut  and the combination of a crunchy almond. My Mom and Dad are now fans too.
5;This is the best energy drink made..! hence the cost!;RedBull is the best! I love it. A bit expensive.
5;strong smooth tea with an aromatic bergamot scent and taste;I am totally addicted to this! i drink it every morning when i wake up and usually have one cup after dinner, . Bergamot is supposed to have properties that aid in digestion and calm your stomach, which i believe in.
5;Love Caribou;I received a Keurig B-70 for Christmas a couple years ago and with it got the Caribou Colombian k-cups.  I used to go to Caribou at least once or twice a week to get my coffee and then just have Folgers the rest of the time.
5;Absolutely Delicious;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Fast shipping!;Wow!  I ordered this on friday night and received on tuesday afternoon.  That's pretty fast considering I am in El Salvador and my address is an APO.
5;Excellent Value;I use to purchase these cereal bars in my local grocery store but they don't have them anymore. To get them I have to go way out of my way.
4;Brings back memories;I had some Pepsi Throwback back in January.  It sure brings back memories of when the formula for Pepsi was different than it is now.
5;Perfect;Excellent transaction and I love miracle noodles.  They are good for us and have 0 calories.
5;Oh the Aroma!;Oh my goodness, these beans smell amazing! they are plump and lots of nice beans inside. I'm using these for making my own vanilla extract, and on day 2 it smelled delicious! I'm only down a few days, but already the color is fantastic.
5;Yummy!;Unusual and delicious.  We rarely eat pretzels, but it's good on crackers, stirred into cream cheese for a veggie dip, and a variety of uses.
5;The Best of the Bunch;The Switch has come out with a wide variety of flavors for their refreshing all natural fruit drink, but the Watermelon Strawberry has to be by far the best. While the Switch juice drinks are good, some of the flavors can be a bit too sweet, despite the complete lack of artificial sweeteners in their product.
5;WONDERFUL COFFEE;"This is so far the best Hazelnut coffee for the money I have had.<br /><br />Nicely flavorful ,wonderful smelling--medium blend that says ""HELLO"" to you in the morning."
3;Hint, premium essence water watermelon;The water is just ok.  I would not buy this again.
5;Nice blend;I really like this spice blend.  It's seen some criticism elsewhere, but I can't understand why
5;Once you popcorners you can't stop;I bought this because I was looking for gluten free alternatives to the junk they sell at the school cafeteria. I bought the 40 pack hoping to have it last me the semester only to have everyone in my family eating them.
5;Great White Cheddar Flavor!;This is the best White Cheddar Cheese popcorn topping that I have ever had. I have been buying it for a few years.
3;Yum yum yum... but melted in transit;I love this peanut brittle.  See's stores open up in the local shopping mall around the holidays, but I needed a fix.
4;Love the taste;I got the dark chocolate cherry cashew, and I just love the taste! It rivals any candy bar. I'm not into candy and am trying to eat clean (Paleo), so thought this would be a nice snack idea for when I'm on the go, etc.
5;Brother uses to flavor dough ball for fishing;Great product and good shipping time. Seller responds quickly and bends over backwards to satisfy you.
1;Not very happy!;Item was listed as a palet of water for $14.57 plus s&H, however, I received a case of water.
5;LOVED PB2;I am the leader in our Wyoming TOPS club. As one of our programs we compared peanut butters for taste, calories, fat, sugars etc.
5;Great product - Shipping Cost almost 3 X the product;The product is great and I got it as an impulse item when purchasing a book.<br />It was delivered separately and the shipping charge was $10 on a 3.
4;hits the spot;For black tea lovers, this is great. A tea that has been around a long time.
5;Breakfast  Blend by Green Mountain;I love my Breakfast Blend coffee from Green Mountain. It light without a bitter aftertaste.
5;Blotto cries for it!;My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet.
5;Mmmmmm...tastes just like their namesake...;"We've been fans of all the Newman's products that we've tried, beginning with his <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;good, not worth 5.00 dollar increase.;Have been using product over 2 years.  Had to play with manufacture recipe on bag.
4;Gets me through the day;"I am what you would call a ""low energy"" person. Before I found this product, sometimes I would just tell people that I am smiling instead of going through the rigamarole of making my mouth curve at the edges."
4;Multiple Boxes of Chocolate;"These taste great, which is the most important thing.  But the ""30 count"" made me think there where 30 in one box."
5;cajun spicy peanuts;Awesome product and was excited to receive them today..
1;NOW MADE IN CHINA!;Beefeater went for profit over the health of our pets. Sad! Gimborn (Pro Treats) are still made in the USA.
5;Definitely the best Oat Meal!;I have not ordered from Amazon yet, but might have to since I haven't been able to find this lately in my store. This requires no sweetener.
4;Cats like this food;I have been happy with the quality of this food as well as delivery time & speed. The cats tried tearing into this bag before their old food is gone yet.
5;L O V E these chips;Can not find them locally yet. Much better than baked!! Only 100 calories per bag.
5;Delicious;A friend gave me one of these bars and they're delicious! I really like how they're low in sodium, soft and slightly chewy. I'm considering buying a dozen and I highly recommend them.
3;Daughter LOVES it!;I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies.
1;Too weak;A waste of my money. Extremely weak
5;A Rare Delicacy Where I Come from;Well, this ink was used for squid ink spaghetti (tomato-sauce spaghetti with squid/cuttlefish ink mixed in), and it's a mild and unique flavor. It does not taste fishy at all.
5;Dog loves them, I haven't tried them.;My dog (a greyhound), loves these treats. Seems like these have really spoiled him, he rarely eats his other treats now.
5;My cats love it!;I have 1 female & 2 male 10 year old tabby cats. Both of my males have had a problem with constipation.
5;So clean, so green;I am absolutely addicted to this stuff. It's such a clean aroma and flavor, the hands-down best sencha ever.
5;A great light treat for the Gluten Free individual;I got these for my wife for Christmas and she loved them too.  With a Gluten Free diet it is tough to get good snacks, but these have been a great quality treat.
1;This stuff is nasty;I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several brands available there which aren't at all bad.
3;Girlfriend loved it, missing some items though;EDIT: Just realized some of the items promised are missing..
5;Fav flavor!;This is my daughter's favorite flavor of the happy tot pouches. I just hand it over and she gobbles it down.
4;Taste very good, healthy, not so great;it's about 160 calories 1/2 cup with milk and 11g of sugar. It good and crunchy with little nuts in each flake.
5;Great for Constipation!;I first tried this out when my 18 month old son was having trouble with constipation.  My doctor reccomended over the counter stool softeners, which I didn't feel comfortable using.
5;Awesome flavor!;The flavoring is absolutely caramel.  No doubt about it.
5;Awesome Bars;These are the best bars out there..
5;YUM!;This popcorn is just like movie theater popcorn, only WAY cheaper!  Plus, you can use it either in your popcorn machine or on the stove, just make sure you use a large pot (like a spaghetti pot) because it makes a lot of popcorn.  One packet feeds 3-5 people, it's good stuff.
5;new zico bottles are FANTASTIC!;Thank you ZICO! i love the new bottles. I was a huge fan of the tetra packs but i couldnt take em anywhere.
4;Hard to get into toy!;These are so hard to get into the toy!  I have had to resort to using a screwdriver to actually get it in.  The medium size is also difficult, but nowhere near as hard as the large size.
5;The best Hazelnut out there!;We have tried all of the Hazelnut flavored coffee brands.  This is by far the best.
5;My favorite morning cup;This is my first cup of coffee in the morning. I brew it at medium strength on my Keurig and find that it has a great bold flavor without any bitterness.
3;Okay, but not the best.;I am really picky about my coffee.  For some reason, I decided that a flavored coffee would be nice for the fall and winter.
5;Love this, love the pepper!;One other reviewer commented that the pepper burned their mouth, but I love that! The competing brand is Oregon Chai, and theirs is much sweeter and with less spice. I personally love the spice and peppery taste of this one, and the reduced sweetness.
5;Husband drinks it every morning.;My husband Loves this coffee. It tastes great and he does not waste a whole pot when he only wants a cup.
5;Good Coffee;I am always looking for ways to buy Fair Trade items and I found this coffee to be an excellent product as well respectful to the environment and to workers.  This was an excellent find.
5;Made my wife happy!;I didn't have a chance to buy flowers locally for Valentines Day and my wife works out of town. Thought I'd try this service.
1;I should have listened;"I read the reviews, but thought that all I needed was a visual marker, so that I could train my dog to go there.  I read so many bad reviews, that I decided not to buy it online, however, I thought the people who said ""the dog will pee anywhere but near the post"" were exaggerating."
5;Surprisingly Tasty!;These little bars are very good - very much like a Mounds bar but without the preservatives and other ingredients. Just a clean, sweet, tasty candy bar with a thin coat of milk chocolate.
2;Definately not a Medium Roast Coffee! Too bold and bitter!;Green Mountain keeps changing the wording on their Amazon description and box for this coffee, and this led me to mistakenly buy it for the third time.  I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).
5;Yummy! (According to the pooch);My dog loves these treats!!  They are a staple in my house.  If texture is a concern they are almost like a jerky treat but softer.
5;Yum!;These Bakery on the Main PB bars are my ultimate favorite!  I love them with my morning coffee.  Tastes like a decadent treat.
5;Ginger for the stomach;This ginger product is handy. It is easy to carry.
5;Might not b loaded with rum but its the best EVA;Sry for all the people whom thought this cake was going to be loaded with rum for them to be drunk off of but it isn't. Its to be enjoyed by people thats not of the legal age themselves also so there is little rum in it.
5;CSC Tomato Powder - adds depth and slightly thickens;This Tomato Powder is a must for many sauces, soups, stews, and an outright requirement for chili.  It adds a depth and richness to anything it is used in and has a nice thickening quality as well.
4;The Price is Right;I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.
1;Very disappointing;I bought the 6 pack of this cereal thinking I would save money by purchasing in bulk.  Three of the six bags arrived either punctured or torn open completely due to rough handling.
5;Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies;When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this.
5;The BEST!;Large ears, not greasy like others I have purchased.  My German Shepherds will work endlessly for these.
5;Spinach Noodles;We have used DaVinci spinach noodles for many years in one of our family's favorite recipes - a chicken & spinach noodle casserole.  Recently, our local grocer has not been stocking the noodles.
1;Not up to the hype, caused bloody stools in my puppy;I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same.
5;My 2 year old loves it;My daughter and I both have celiac.  This is her favorite cereal even over cocoa pebbles.
3;Almost, but not quite;There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.
5;Yummy pancakes and waffles;Making gluten-free pancakes with this mix is incredibly easy. The sorghum flour in the mix gives them a lovely, nutty taste that goes perfectly with syrup.
4;"""Picky Dog"" loved this food!";I had both of my golden retrievers try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to see if they would like it.  The 8 month old overgrown puppy will eat almost anything and he loved this dog food, which I expected him to do.
4;Chai Latte K-Cups;I absolutely love this latte!  It is the best hot drink I've ever had.  One complaint is the price I paid at Amazon.
5;Bestest Big Bob Gibson Red BBQ Sauce;I saw this Big Bob Gibson Championship Red Sauce reviewed on the food network channel and they said it won several awards, and when they interviewed folks in the restaurant they all raved about this BBQ sauce and they were right on!!!! This BBQ sauce is excellent, I have used it on chicken and pork ribs and my hubby raved about this sauce, I will have to order more online. I don't think you will be disappointed with Big Bob.
4;Decent glasses;Received the product at the very last day in the range they promised, but it go here on time. Glasses are decent, and I love how 2 spoons are included as well.
3;RIP OFF;My dog loves these and I have always bought them at Sams Club for $11. (Exact same package).
5;great!;I wish I would have known about this with my first child!<br /><br />I successfully breastfed my first child for three years but also had the luxury of staying home with her.  Returning to work after my second child has been a little easier in knowing that I can still provide pumped breast milk for him!<br /><br />I tried this tea in hopes that it would both help with my supply when I cannot be home and with my letdown while pumping.
5;Spicy and delicious;I love jerky.<br />When it comes to fresh organic jerky nothing beats Ed's Roadhouse.
5;The best salt for pre-seasoning;Maldon salt is the best for seasoning proteins before saute or grilling.  It makes a really good finishing salt as well.
5;Fantastic Flavor!;"Quite honestly I did not believe you could get quality ""instant"" Indian fare.  Amazon's special pricing me decide to try three cases, the Chana Masala, Paneer and Taka Dal."
5;oh what a tasty treat!;we have polished off the hazelnut and are moving next to the vanilla--along with more hazelnut! the price here is very good--i paid $5.49 per bag at Duane Reade.
4;Natural Flavoring;I enjoy my coffee, and have become rather picky about the coffee I drink.  Normally I avoid Starbucks coffees as I find them too dry.
5;Yummo!;These wafers are PHENOMENAL! They are creamy, not too sweet (I had the regular chocolate ones) and perfect for whether you want just a few or a bunch. They are light and have a lovely texture.
5;Yummmmmmmmmy !!!!!;These are the BEST bars I have ever had. When I made the mix I thought that it would be too sugary, but it was just right in my opinion.
2;Cute tray, but...;This looks great and is very sturdy, but it is very difficult to get the ice out because it is so stiff (can't twist it at all).  I turn it over and hope it works eventually.
2;Not great;Very disappointed with the flavor, or lack therof.  Stash usually has dependable products, so this was a real letdown.
4;Interesting blend;I gave this a shot out of curiosity and was glad I did. It's a very good cup of coffee.
4;Tastes great;Great to have a sugar that tastes great, cooks with everything, and has not yet been cooped by the GMO crowd of producers.  We'll order again, and enjoyed the speedy delivery.
5;Wow, great stuff!;I bought this to make cinnamon toothpicks and the taste is wonderful. Like other reviewers have said, use it sparingly.
4;Nice snack bar alternative!;"Well, if you are following the ""only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less"" rule, this product, Larabar's ""cherry pie"" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries."
3;Tasty, but tiny;Good ingredients, tastes good, but there are about 3-4 little nuggets in the bag.  I was hungry when I bought them
5;Fantastic;Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down.
5;Excellent Saffron;Not all saffron is the same.<br />Threads are far superior to powder.
5;I'm addicted;I love these Kedem Tea Biscuits.  I've tried the chocolate, orange & vanilla flavors and all are wonderful.
2;Not so BOLD anymore;I used to love the Bold Party Blend when it was the same mix pictured on the old packaging they have on Amazon.<br /><br />Now they've reduced the flavor (it has to have at least half the intensity it used to have) and removed the round crackers--which were fantastic with the Bold Party Blend seasoning.
4;Really good in smoothies;This was really good in smoothies. I love that I can make something quick, fun, and healthy for the kids to consume.
5;The best granola;I was very happy to see my regular grocery store now carrying Bear Naked.  It's the best tasting granola I've found yet.
5;Rich flavorful pinto beans every time;I discovered this spice years ago as a native Texan as it is stocked in nearly every grocery store in our state. It is  inexpensive to keep on hand to make a flavorful pot of beans with or without salt pork, bacon or any other meat added.
5;Great coffee even when used with the espresso machine.;Great coffee. The cream that comes out with the espresso machine is always perfect!<br />If you like a strong bold aroma this is the coffee for you.
3;disappointing because it doesn't taste like tea;I find this whole line disappointing, perhaps, for no other reason than I expect this  to taste like tea. Sadly, it tastes like colored water.
4;Looks like Pate meh  -1 star;well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.
5;A must have during your moon cycle!;Really works! This is a well researched and well balanced combination of herbs. The key ingredients are red raspberry leaf (amazing), dong quai and vitex - all great women herbs.
2;Not to My Taste;I thought the ginger taste was overpowering, like drinking a gingersnap cookie. As a hot drink it didn't really work for me.
2;Reformulated version much worse than before;"When this product became a ""Helper Complete Meal"" instead of just a regular ""Complete Meal"", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it."
5;My Kids Love This;I like the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Breast because of the quality and lack of chemical additives. And both my cat and dog would eat only this if they could.
1;Why is this listed as Invisible?;When we're looking for invisible, that means clear.  Like the clear Invisible Raspberry, and clear Invisible Grape and clear Invisible watermelon-kiwi.
3;OK Product But..;I have popped several of these bags in the past week, And every single one of them does not pop up as much as they used to. They used to pop up like a bag of popcorn does, These bags stay very flat in the microwave oven, And when you take the bag out you have to be very quick about opening it, Or it implodes and sticks together!<br /><br />I used to purchase these Microwave Pork Rinds direct from the company, And had never had a problem until now.
5;Tasty!;Very flavorful snack and I love the cocoa flavor! Couldn't taste a lot of the cinnamon but enjoyed the flavor nonetheless. It's great as a snack alone or on top of yogurt or ice cream.
5;Best Donut Shop K-cup on the Market!  Awesome price;I just tried the Martinson Donut Shop k-cup.  It has a much better(robust) flavor than the Coffee People Donut Shop that I have been buying for years.
5;Delicious chocolate taste;Yes, this cereal is soft when in milk, but so what? I like the taste, the texture and aroma. It may not be the healthiest cereal out there but it doesn't claim to be.
5;Paw Lickin Indeed!;My two boy kitties LOVE this food..
1;Not ESE pods!;It is not obvious from the product description but these are NOT single serve ESE-type espresso pods.  They do not fit in our Krups espresso machine at all.
5;Love this coffee!;My husband and I have been ordering this coffee for over a year.  Amazon still seems to be the cheapest even though we have had a few price increases which have resulted in approx $7 per box since we first ordered.
5;Great Flavor;Whole family loved 'em. Hard enough to break your teeth (in a good way, they are kettle chips after all).
5;Great cat food!;My cat eats this food with no problems. I don't have much to compare because I try not to switch his food, but it's a high-quality cat food at a reasonable price for premium food.
3;Eh.;I wanted my pup to love these. He is a 11 week old Yorkshire Terrier and he doesn't seem too interested in them.
5;Same graham crackers;
5;Jade Green Tea is the best I have tasted;I recently bought a Melitta One:One expecting to love the coffee.  Instead I love this tea!  I have tasted many varieties of  green tea in my life.
5;Good seller!;Great speed! Got here exactly when promised, but the coconut oil seemed to have leaked maybe due to altitude pressure (?). Nevertheless, they had it bagged, so the box wasn't all oily.
5;This is my Passion!;Tazo Passion is my one of my favorite teas.  I was so happy to find it here at a great price.
5;Royal Dansk Danish Butter Cookies;My mother loves these imported Danish butter cookies, so I had the 4-tin pack shipped to her for Christmas. She was delighted when she received the package, and she says the cookies are fresh and delicious.
5;The best GF bread I have had yet!;Let's face it, most GF bread is disgusting!  Who wants to eat something you have to nuke or toast to eat it and it still is awful?  Not this bread.  Very easy to make (although my rising time is a lot longer than 40 minutes).
5;GOOD FOR GARDENING;I BUY BARE ROOT BERRY PLANT THAT I PUT IN THESE BURLAP BAGS WITH POOTING SOIL TO TRANPLANT LATER INTO THE GROUND WHEN THE WEATHER GETS WARMER. THE BURLAP BAG ARE BIOGRADEABLE.
5;Instant Favorite;I usually go for loose leaf tea, but there are a few good kinds I have only seen in stores in the typical tea bags. I had never had yerba mate, but the varied ingredients such as green tea, spearmint leaves, green rooibos, black pepper and such was like Tazo had asked me what most of my favorite tea components are and mixed them together! Delicious and invigorating, I recommend this tea.
4;Sometimes watery, sometimes more solid. Baby loves it anyway.;Nothing much to comment on this except my baby loves this. I purchased in bulk with my subscribe and save membership.
5;True Blueberry herbal tea;"B""H<br /><br />A while back, Celestial Seasonings discontinued my favorite tea, Strawberry Kiwi. Since I drink mostly Celestial Seasonings iced herbal teas (which I make with stevia since I'm diabetic and holistic) I didn't know what to do but I found two flavors that work very well together -- True Blueberry and Moroccan Pomegranate Red."
5;Excellent;These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one.
5;Tastes great!;I love this DaVinci sugar free Kahlua flavored syrup.  It's great when added to diet cola and vodka for a Black Russian and I even add a bit of half and half for a White Russian if I feel decadent.
5;Very pleased with purchase;The pork hocks were a nice cut of meat and had a firm texture, nothing like the garbage that you get from most local grocery stores in California. The Polish Sausage was spicy but not hot and had good flavor.
5;Smooth and rich;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began life as a cafe in rural Vermont. They specialized in quality coffee, and continue that tradition through to today.
4;my finicky cat LOVES this;My finicky cat refuses most canned food - he loves this ..
1;Inconsistent;This jerky was very inconsistent. The first piece I ate was extremely tough and flavorless.
2;This tea is ok;I normally buy from mountain rose herbs, but this is a really good price for organic tea so I had to try it.  In my opinion it tastes a little bitter no matter how long it steeps.
5;1 year olds LOVE this flavor;"This is the one flavor that my 1 year olds will always eat - no matter what food phase they are in. Now that they are on ""solid"" solid foods I use it as a topping on other vegtables or pasta."
5;Mom of a SPD preschooler;Absolutely delicious. He wanted more.
5;Taste just like LaQuinta's waffle mix;You got to order this. Taste just like the waffle mix used at Laquinta Hotels.
1;Dangerous charger;We have large and small animals and needed something that would work for both. This isn't it.
3;Good, Not Great;I usually use Sweet 'N Low but decided to try out this type of Splenda due to its nutritional benefit claims. I use sweetener in unsweet iced tea and had to use two packets in order to get the sweetness I desire.
5;Excellent;I discovered Flavrz while looking for a way to flavor water so I wouldn't drink so much soda. I found that almost every flavor packet had artificial sweeteners in them.
5;Coconut oil fan, here;I really like to use coconut oil for baking. It produces a much lighter end product than shortening does, and it's much better for you.
5;Dog's love this food;This dog food is packed full of great stuff. You can see the chunks of chicken, carrots, peas and pasta.
4;Mammoth bone....Kinda;I purchased 2 of these for my dogs ( ones a bull mast and the other a Lab)<br />Bones are large but they break into small parts easily.<br />Overall i would say this is a good buy!<br /><br />beware of the bone breaking into small sections.
5;Healthy protein!;I'm trying my best to eat healthy foods and be sure to get enough protein during the day and this takes care of both.  It's a great snack for me at work and when I'm in a hurry and I get the protein I need.
4;good chocolate;good chocolate.  A bit pricey but the texture and consistency were easy to work with and my friends all raved about the flavor.
5;Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour;I like the flour, but it is difficult to find recipes and know how to use it in conjunction with other flours. If you love to cook and are an experimental type of person, you can really have some fun with this.
5;Great;Bergin Nut Company Roasted Sunflower Seeds are delicious.  Fresh, crisp, lightly salted with no bitter bites waiting for you.
5;We use in Rancilio espresso machine;It is important to know how your coffee is decaffeinated.  For example, one method is the direct method which uses methylene chloride in the process.
4;Tart Twisted Berry Goodness;Very strong tart berry taste in a twisted fruit rope.  Can be tough on the jaw but very yummy.
5;Murphy loves it!!;First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived undamaged, great job amazon. So I have been feeding my dog Costco brand dog food, which Murphy (my english Black lag) woofs down in seconds.
5;They're great!;Lucy's Cinnamon Thin cookies, while a little pricy, are quite tasty.  I like to let them get slightly stale so that they are chewy, although that doesn't happen often because they are usually gone too quickly.
5;crispy great taste;I think these dried apple chips are the best I've ever tasted. They are full of flavor and no after taste.
5;love this tea!;I love this tea, and was so glad to find it in this quantity! The tea is individually packaged so it is fresh. Works great to relieve stress of day.
5;Great Tasting Coffee, Great K-Cups Too!;A friend offered me a cup of this about a week ago. Wonderful stuff! Disappointing when he told me, it's not in stores.
4;easy;Easy but they have a definite pre-fab taste, the cheese reminds me the kind of cheese crackers you get out of a vending machine.  Extremely easy to make though, I don't have kids but they taste like something kids would really enjoy.
5;Fantastic;This is going to sound like a broken record but this stuff is great.  My German Shepard, like the others, has horrible food allergies.
5;Very Tasty And Unavailable In Stores;Awesome invention. I wish it was more available in stores.
5;Sooooo Yummy!;I love this tea. It has an earthy flavor that I can't seem to get enough of.
3;Not at all what I expected.;I did not want an extra bold coffee. This is not listed as extra bold, but that is what arrived at my door.
5;My dogs love Wellness;My dogs and I love this food. They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them.
5;Delicious!;This coffee is absolutely delicious!  And the smell is heavenly!  The caramel and vanilla flavors are just strong enough that they taste wonderful.  I do need to add Sweet and Low though because I like my coffee extra sweet.
5;Wow.;These are amazing. If you like picking marshmallows out of name brand cereal you need this.
5;UNBELIEVABLE PRICE!;These freeze dried treats are our dogs favorite treats.  We've been spending DOUBLE the price I paid for them at local area pet stores (ie, Chuck & Don's and PetSmart).
1;MONO-SUCKIN'-SODIUM GLUTAMATE;"bought two bags and at the time the details did not include the ingredients. says ""naturally"" not once but twice on the bag."
1;As the recipient pointed out, this was a basket of cardboard.;I was mortified when the friend I sent this to told me that she felt I should ask for my money back. She said it was a basket of cardboard, the quantities of food are ridiculously small.
5;Best tea EVER!;This tea is, by far, the best tea I have ever had. I've tried many different teas (green and white mostly, not a big fan of black tea).
5;Delicious!;I bought a variety of Stash brand organic tea for our office and everyone loves it! The chamomile is so smooth and flavorfull..
5;Senseo coffee is so Senseo;The Senseo coffee maker creates a light foamy coffee regardless of using Dark or light roast. The roast type does establish a wonderful flavor.
5;Mmmmmm. Tasty.;I like this cheese to make open faced tomato sandwich when they're in season. Lighter than most, not as salty.
5;ADDICTING;These cookies are almost too good..
5;Puppy Loves It;My Peek a Pom puppy loves it.  I mix it with dry food in the morning and he eats every bite.
5;Some of the best chips anywhere;Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack.
5;The Taste of New Orleans;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;It will not cripple my muscles;I have tried Splenda and Equal these sugars substitutes do something to my muscles like if they shrink and lose flexibility. My aging parents bought a box of Equal, and I warned them about this situation.
5;Christmas Gift;Yes, I received Pocket Coffee for some friends for Christmas. I heard from them last night and they throughly enjoyed the gift.
4;Good coffee poor shipping;This product arrived with several of the items damaged in shipping.  The coffee was very good with robust flavor and slightly acidic.
4;Traverse Dried Blueberries;These blueberries are delicious.  I just wish they sold an alternate version without sugar or oil.
4;Very convenient;I love to bake. Breads, biscuits, cakes, etc.
5;Nutritious, Wholesome Ingredients...SAFE !!!;I am very grateful I was introduced to this item 3 years ago when I flunked Fostering 101 and adopted Rosie, a rescue with allergies. This kibble has NO nasty 'meal' (read: beaks, claws, lips.
5;Awesome snack for your little ones!!;"You may not think so, but this lollipop has less sugar than most other ""sugary"" snacks.  And no artificial dyes makes it even better!  I carry around a zip lock back full of them in my purse and use them as rewards for good behavior when we are out."
1;Hardly indestructible...;I bought this for my 8-mo-old blue heeler/husky puppy, and she managed to pull the rope enough to break it within 2 days. She's a rough-and-tumbler to be sure, but they claimed it was indestructible.
5;Great price, great product.;This rice is very delicious, I have grown to love it and indeed use it as my go to side dish when preparing a meal. Its easy and it tastes great every time.
5;My best frieds love Cesar!;I have four small-to medium size best canine friends.  They absolutely adore Cesar and turn their noses up at anything else.
5;Great Coffee;Very Good coffee ..
4;I enjoyed the results and scent of this shampoo.;Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner works.  The bottle I received to try was a bit damaged from the shipping.
1;Everlasting? Not even for 1 hour!;"This is one of the quite typical case of misleading descriptions and claims. This so called ""everlasting"" and ""large"" treat did not last for even an hour after I gave it to my dog."
4;Not half bad! Pretty good, actually!;This stuff was on sale at a local supermarket. Being a fan of shakable drink mixes like this, a fan of lemonade in general, and the low price of $0.
5;Yummy!;These gummy snacks are wonderful! They are in nice big bags. My kids loved these and I loved them as well.
4;Once in a while special treat;My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors..
5;Sent as a gift;"We sent this as a gift for Christmas and it went over very well.  The recipient sent us an email with the subject, ""MMM MMM good""!  It turns out her favorite candy are Savannah pralines and chocolate gophers."
5;antioxident power;This came and I use it every day mixed with club soda and a touch of tonic water. It tastes good and i know it is good for us.
5;Great Travel organizer!;Gals, this Hadaki travel organizer is GREAT!  Perfect size and wonderful quality.  I use 2 -  one for my makeup and one for my toiletries.
5;PG Tips Pyramid Tea;PG Tips 240 Tea Bags<br /><br />I love this product
4;how can diced fruit in syrup be bad?;I purchased these to eat as snacks and got exactly what I paid for!<br />What you get are handy little cups filled to the brim with mixed diced fruit (mostly peach & pear) with just enough syrup to keep the fruit wet.<br />Be careful when you peel back the lid to open them cause they are so full that it is easy to get the sticky syrup on your hands and on the counter.
5;Great Quality, great price;This is the healthiest coffee I have found for my Keurig.  The quality of the coffee keeps you satisfied with one cup.
4;A great coffee at a great price;We found the Lavazza Pienaroma to be a high quality, very satisfying coffee. It makes a perfect expresso to enjoy in the morning with your favorite biscotti or an excellent cappucino after a good meal.
4;Great product;Calm products are wonderful.  Used as directed will bring positive results.
5;Perfect snack.  Really.;We've tried most the Kind bar flavors, but this one is THE favorite among my bunch.  They offer a perfect blend nutty and sweetness.
4;Ginger Altoids;They are good, but not for anyone that has a sensitive palate.  Very strong, not recommended for any children!  Good for the stomach.
4;Popcorn;This popcorn isn't bad tasting, but doesn't live up to the claim that it's like theater popcorn.  I think it's a little pricey based on the quantity of popped corn and the overall quality.
5;Beyond GOOD;I love chocolate ..
5;SO SMOOTH;This is the only coffee I've bought for a year now. The flavor is great and the coffee is not too bold-not too weak.
5;Very fresh and tasty. Great Porridge;Very good Porridge. I thought 6 pack will be a lot for me.
4;Okay corn. Arrived promptly without issues.;When you have Libby's on the label..
5;great instant coffee;I am a coffee fanatic, so my standards for instant coffee have always been impossibly high, but I LOVE Starbuck's Via. It really is tasty and it dissolves completely in cold water.
3;Taste;Vanilla tastes like cake batter. It makes it hard to mix with other flavors.
5;Refreshing and tasty;A blend of grape, apple, blackbery, lemon and raspberry juice with sparkling spring water, these are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />If you are watching the calories be aware that these little 8.
5;My Vet recommended these, I get them through Amazon.;My dog was developing tarter on her teeth at a young age.  Her Vet recommended these chews to help relieve the problem in the hope of avoiding a full blown dental cleaning under anethesia.
5;Bigelow Mint Medley Herbal Tea;After having a craving for mint tea for several days, I went to the local Wal-Mart and purchased this tea.  I compared all the different mint teas and this won out because of the ingredients (peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus), which make for a very refreshing cup of tea.
5;ADDICTING!;These chips are the BEST out there. Period.
5;Totally Worth It!;I have a husband and three little boys - all of whom would eat brown gravy with every meal.  However, my family only prescribes to McCormick's brown gravy, so I was spending *lots* of money on individual packs.
5;Pillpockets are a Lifesaver;My dog Andy requires 3 pills 3 times a day. I started using Pillpockets almost two years ago.
1;Disappointed;The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away.
5;Yummy!!;This stuff is so yummy and fairly healthy. I adore the cute little hotel sized containers.
2;Crown Prince Anchovies--Not good!;I went on line to buy good, firm, jar anchovies.  This was a real disappointment.
5;temptation junction what's yer function?;I'm not quite sure why this product listing is for the chicken variety yet in the product description it speaks of how the beef version is made. That's a little confusing and makes me wonder about the chicken version.
3;four stars for the cookies, two for the packaging;These cookies were quite delicious, and reminded me of those my grandmother used to bake for me when I was a kid.  Unfortunately, I only got to taste them in very little bits, as every box was crushed and the cookies inside were broken into small bits and crumbs.
5;jolly ranchers;Super fast shipping, reasonably priced, will definatly buy from again in the future. Thanks so much for the fantastic service! I love Amazon.
5;Great Price on an excellent product;After researching many options for the Nature's Prairie Lamb and Oatmeal Variety, we found sitstay.com to be the best price.
5;best treat;My dogs love these treats! When my dogs wake up in the morning thats the first thing they want to eat! Especially my dog Luna cries for one. When I say greenie, she immediately runs downstairs and sit right in front of the pantry for one.
5;Awesome Dog Food;I guess you do really get what you pay for!<br />It's expensive but top quality. There is a huge difference between this and any other dog food.
5;Best in Class Dry Dog Food;Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars)
1;a big 'NO';I ordered these flowers for my girl on Valentine. What you get is not what this pics shows.
5;Great for Dogs with Allergies;My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations.
4;Hazelnut coffee smells and tastes like Buttered Popcorn not as much like Hazelnut;This coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn. I am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good, It just doesn't typically taste like hazelnut.
4;they work!;i have 26 african violets, i was losing alot of leaves due to thrips and a few had cyclemen mites. i used these 2in1 fert/pesticide spikes in all of them, and now (3 wks later) i no longer lose any leaves and my violets are now healthy and growing strong.
4;Yummy;I had been trying to remember the name of the these cookies for years so I could look for them. When i finally did and ordered this box, I was not disappointed at all.
5;Love, Love, Love It!;I feel in this with this candy when I went on a trip to Savannah, every year when I went to visit, I would buy it by the pounds.  All of a sudden,I went to purchase it and they no longer had it, needless to say I was SO disappointed.
4;decaffinated, not my choice;I can't have caffeine so I use this coffee.  It's good, but not great and I think it's because of the lack of caffeine.
5;Yummy;The cucumber dill is tasty, some flavor but not overwhelming.  They are good on their own or with hummus or other dips, and (bonus!)kids love them.
5;"A healthy ""Eat-Right"" treat that I feel good about!";After 10 years with a pair of dogs who beg daily for dog treats, but having them become overweight on cookie type (wheat based) dog biscuits, I decided to look for alternative treats, since wheat is such a common source of allergies in dogs. I also had one dog die of liver disease, and from my research I discovered that a high-grain diet is the suspected culprit.
5;Oh my gosh good!;I added shredded carrots, walnuts and some extra cinnamon (I like cinnamon!) to the mix and it made such a wonderful carrot cake. I also made a homemade cream cheese icing to top it with.
1;Never again;I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.
5;Yummmm!;We tried several different kinds of gluten free recpies for Pizza dough. This has been by far the best.
4;Honest Brew;"Stash have tried very hard to get quality product for the consumers. The tea comes fairly close to the best on the market -  this is quite an endorsement from an Indian palate who has nearly 30 years of twice daily Darjeeling tea drinking ""experience""."
1;Not for my dog;I purchased this, thinking it to be a good product.<br /><br />However, within 3 days, my dog was itching and pulling her hair out.
5;Great Price;I add a tbsp of this flaxseed to our morning smoothies for health benefits.  Amazon sells the product for almost half the price I have found at local grocery stores.
5;My Favorite Szechuan sauce!;I use this every day. I eat plain white jasmine rice with this sauce, and it's delicious.
5;Great;I use this for 1. internal health (drink it like a tea, watered down though.
5;Refreshing and delicious;"A friend of mine had tried hibiscus tea and said it was a great ""fruity"" tea. I bought the Davidson's and was pleased with the product."
5;There is good and then there is wonderful;Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.
5;Finally, a food my allergic cat will eat that won't make him sick!;One of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate. There are many types of food that the vet recommended trying (duck, venison, etc.
1;over priced;Somehow I thought for the price - I was getting a case - not one little bag.  Should have ordered the case I found elsewhere.
5;Be careful! Dogs LOVE IT!;When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them.
3;inconsistant product,  Tea roulette;Every bag of this tea I've tried so far has been very different from  the other bags. Sort of a Tea roulette.
1;Hernia Inducing Cat Litter;"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one."
5;THE ONLY THING MY 3-YEAR-OLD WILL EAT FOR BREAKFAST!;Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.
5;So good!...........;One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.
5;Get your water quota, and then some!;I too dislike the tastelessness of plain water. I don't want overpowering flavor either.
1;If you want fiber, don't buy!;I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon.
5;My son loves this!;He loves this Banana flavor amongs other flavor and other brands.<br />I use 4 plastic scoops (Formula scoops) plus 4 ounces of warm water with just the right consistency! The bowl is always left empty and baby who started this at 4 months with 2 scoops and now 9 months old and still loves it.
5;Very good;I enjoyed the flavor of the tea not too over powering. The item arrived very quikly.
3;strong, burnt and bitter;I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.
5;Hard to find but well worth the search;I bought this for my mother who could no longer find it. Tea is of course a matter of personal taste but on this topic I can agree with her.
5;Love the Mini's;Perfect size to keep in your purse, the Altoid smalls are just as strong as the large ones - great taste.  I could not find the cinnamon smalls anywhere so was delighted to find them on Amazon.
5;"Tastes almost like a ""regular"" orange/tangerine soda!";I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange/tangerine flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Kiwi Strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well.
5;SOOO gooood!!;I gave up diet coke last year. I drink water but it gets old after a while.
5;2nd favorite here!;I too have a problem cat - she was starved before I got her and well, her coat, skin, and overall condition was ridiculous.  This was one of the foods that she went mad for, still does, and well, you should see her now!  She's a chocolate Persian and has the most beautiful long, shiny coat now! Friskies has a great variety of healthy, protein-filled products that both I and my vet credit for bringing her back.
1;Apropos;Ghost is a good name. Both specimens that I purchased from this nursery gave up the ghost within a couple of weeks.
5;The only thing that worked;I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information.
5;Just Right;Arrived Early. The site tells it all about the item.
5;Exactly as expected;Your basic tin of mints.  I don't like them as well as Altoids, but they are great for my Chicago-themed party.
5;Fantastically Delicious;"do you like dark chocolate?  wish you could find quality dark chocolate cocoa mix?  this is the real deal!  i have tried a few different ""dark"" chocolate mixes.  this one stands above others in it's smooth'ness and creamy quality."
1;from concentrate!;This stuff is terrible. It has that concentrated and plasticky taste as if it's not fresh.
5;Wiskas  Temptations;"These are for cats ""Wiska Temptations"" (I found after I purchased them)but my MinPin will stand up and beg for these. I thought he might get tired of them, but he hasn't and I can get him to do anything for some."
5;Brandy filled cherries;I buy these every Christmas for my daughter and Son-in-law as well as myself.  They are great.
4;I like this tea;I like this tea because it has a nice subtle flavor without the bitterness that one often experiences with black teas.  And, I'm told that oolong tea is good for your health too, and that's why I tried it.
5;SURE O.N.E IS THE BEST!!!;O.N.
5;Marvelous, especially with added lemon juice;I'm a water drinker and I still drink a lot of it straight from the filter. But water can get boring.
5;Pop Tart  Replacement;I never thought I would see the day!!!! This is an amazing product. Another excellent healthy junk food replacement, and they taste wonderful.
4;Cat likes it, but doesn't help tartar;My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms.
5;Peach Tea - the best tea ever;"Iced or hot, you can't get a more flavorful tea.  It is ""peachy"", but tastes tropical to me as well."
5;We loved it.;My daughter was a premie and was on the Enfacare until 6 months. As soon as we were given the okay by our doctor to change her formula, we went straight to gentlease after friend recommendations.
5;Great for baking!;I love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking, and have been using it for nearly 20 years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes.<br /><br />It's also tasty to drink, For a portable mix, I'll use instant dry milk, this coffee, a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener.
5;Hot and flavorful!!;This is a very good choice for seasoning. I find myself putting it on almost everything! Not only is it very spicy but it also has a wonderful flavor.
5;Eight O'Clock 100% Colombian Coffee;"A mellow coffee with enough body for a coffee ""lover"".<br />I dig coffee , but too strong is not my desire."
1;Yuck...;As a regular consumer of Kashi Go Lean Cereal, I thought I would try this banana Chocolate Chip Bar.  Very gross flavors, and as one reviewer said, tastes like burnt bananas with no extra flavoring.
5;Very decent coffee.;Was worried that this would be a super roasted bean like the old Coffee People French Roast -- which I loved, but could only have in small doses -- but this turns out to be a fine coffee for daily caffeination.  Also, in case you're curious how they pair with those Yoku Moku Billet au chocolat au lait you picked up at Narita on your way home from Tokyo, rest assured they taste very nice together.
5;Best tasting protein bars;These are the best tasting protein bars i've ever eaten. the taste sweet but only have 5 grams of sugar.
4;Good product but I was expecting the Wolf size to be bigger;The product is very good.  It is the type of bone I was planning to get for my dogs.
5;Sodastream;After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99.
1;Simply Nasty;I bought this because I have celiac disease and was really craving some muffins.  I am not a health nut, I just can't eat gluten.
5;Made this PA Hausfrau very happy! Sehr gut!;Bravo! What a good deal! Now we don't worry about running out of this very healthy and tasty bread. At the time of purchase, the price per loaf was lower than anywhere within reasonable driving distance.
5;Smooth not Bitter;Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh.
4;As good as I remember from The Biltmore Estate Winery in Asheville, NC;We first tasted these crackers at the Biltmore Estate Winery in Asheville, NC and loved their taste.  I forgot to purchase them before leaving Asheville and was thrilled to see that Amazon had them for purchase at a reasonable price.
5;Just Made for Lazy Cooks Like Me;I have a fraternal twin sister who always uses fresh garlic when she cooks, which is not as often as I cook. As for me, I found buying jars of crushed garlic in my grocery store eons quicker and less messy than doing it myself.
1;For licorice lovers only;Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.
4;Appears burnt...;I have used sesame oil before , the darker tasty kind but i dont recall it being this strong and apparently burnt. I mixed this product with olive oil and soybean oil equal parts of each and it is still very strong.
5;Green Tea with Pomegranate;This is a great tasting tea.  Nice mellow flavor and the pomegranate takes the edge off of the green tea.
4;Tasty Low-Fat Granola;"For some reason, the package of these ""healthy grains"" doesn't use the word ""granola.""<br /><br />Funny -- the product sure looks, smells, and tastes like granola to me."
2;Not that good.;I must have got a bad batch because it is not hot and has very little flavor. It was nothing like the reviews.
5;Very good bread;This is a great bread.  I've tried quite a few brands frozen and packaged.
5;Low fat, low sodium, great for baking or smoothies;I've used regular powdered peanut butter for baking in the past (not PB2 brand) and really liked it.  It stores well long-term without going rancid like the oils in regular peanut butter do.
4;Great authentic taste;Rendang is a Malay curry dish not easily found in the US so I was surprised to see it offered on Amazon. This package mix is easy to make and produces a lot of flavor.
5;Innova works for us!;Our little dog had really bad skin allergies and was on California Naturals for quite a while with no relief. We decided to switch her to the Innova and a week later she is not scratching anymore and her hair is growing back.
3;It's okay but I won't buy it again.;I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.
4;Good buy - when on sale;These were tasty and I like the concept of being popped.  I don't think I would pay the retain price, though.
2;Very good product, very bad price;The product quality is great, but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D'Oro brand due to the ongoing strike. The retail price clearly marked on each package is $2.
2;Diabetic Shock!;Well I give this a two star only because I read its sweetened with Splenda, so shock might not really be an issue. But unless you really like eating out of the sugar bowl this is not for you.
5;One of my favorite teas!;I absolutely LOVE this tea. I first tried it at a deli in Portland and I've been hooked ever since.
4;I can't believe I'm giving something with soy milk so many stars...;I'd never tried anything with soy intentionally and didn't realize this was soy milk.  I'm not a gym goer, someone who exercises much or even a healthy eater.
5;Peppermint for sure!;I started using peppermint oil for my sebhorriac dermatitis and someone said to try the tea for digestion and irritable bowel syndrome.  Though I have only used it twice, I have to admit it did help me.
1;If you liked it in tetrapak box, don't buy now;I bought this new Zico water hoping to have the good taste it had before but unfortunately it tastes horrible. I could not bear drinking half bottle.
5;a GOOD BUY;I find this milk a very good buy and easy to mix up.  It really helps me and my mother, as she has to have a very high calcium intake.
4;Canidae Dog Treats;"The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The ""snap"" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want."
4;seren;It is a nice enjoyable, chocolate treat.  Of course, probably better in the restaurant, but nice to be able to enjoy at home.
1;Surprise 1  It's different...;Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.
5;Super chip;Love these cracker chips.  I was hesitant to try these, but am sold.
5;Great tasting;The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve.
5;Yummy doggy dots;I didn't realize when i bought these that they were going to be so small, so as a treat for anything larger than a yorkie you might have to use a small handful of these. Great for my dog outside of the size because they are grain free and have no fillers which my dog is allergic to.
5;bought it at a great price;My husband likes the coffee and we bought it at a great price.  (Starbucks is normally pretty expensive coffee.
4;Good greens can come in a can!;One of my co-workers that prepares meals for my shift said good greens don't come in a can. At my request she heated up a can of these seasoned greens and was very surprised.
4;Similar to Hamburger Helper with a Velveeta taste;We had two boxes of this product for 7 of us and had plenty.  Taste is good if you like Velveeta Cheese flavor rather than American Cheese.
5;easy dinner;This soup mix is the easiest meal I make.  It qualifies as a hearty meal in my book, and it can be on the table and into a tummy that is headed out for soccer or football.
3;OK, but not exceptional tea;The Dilmah is a competent black tea.  There was nothing remarkable about the taste or the experience.
5;Nice Coooool!;This beverage comes in an 6.8 Fluid Ounce serving.
5;Davids Kosher Salt;I have used Davids Kosher Salt for a decade. It isn't something you can find locally which isn't surprizing - This is not your everyday salt.
3;feel better;It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.
2;Not as shown;Stirrers do not come in container shown.  Got these for a parts and they are presented in a cardboard box.
1;Good but the cost is so wrong;The peanut butter is very good but the shipping cost makes it worthless to be honest.  We don't have this locally but anted to try it.
5;Addictive to dogs;It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find.
5;Great Product;The vet made me get the expensive food his office pushes on everyone and I'm sure gets paid to sell to his patients. I fed this to my cat and he went from a healthy 12 pounds up to 20 pounds.
3;Not for fine hair;I can't  imagine what hair needs volumizing if not fine straight hair, but this shampoo really doesn't work well for that kind of hair.  It feels rather luxurious - creamy & smooth - and it has a nice, light scent, but it's really too heavy for thin strands.
5;Absolutely fabulous;The tiki cat brand food is amazing! I have 7 cats and every one of them loves it! It's expensive but worth every penny. If you have a finicky cat this is the food to try.
1;Disappointed;I ordered this pack and have been so disappointed.  Following the directions, I found the coffee practically tasteless.
1;Disappointed, not the classic flavor;The title says it all.<br />And to top it off, the color isn't right either.
5;Great Clementine, OK Apple;The Sparkling Clementine Flavor is my favorite of the three I tired with the Blackberry coming in close. They all have a similar mix of ingredients as the apple below.
2;Tasty but not truly raw;These taste great and it's nice to see they've come out with some naked seaweed without anything added.  However.
5;*Yummy* *Spicy*;Forget that store bought jerky.  Make your own premium jerky with American Spice's Hot Beef Jerky Blend.
5;MIO got me off sweet tea!;I actually discovered MIO months ago when it was on display at a store. Reluctantly I tried it, knowing my caffeinated/sugar induced addiction to McDonald's Sweet Tea was slowly swallowing me like a black hole, haha.
5;My Lucky Day!;That was the day a friend told me about Dreamfields pasta.  I don't have to worry about blood sugar
5;A delicious little kick...;I'm a big tea drinker and am quite fond of Yogi teas for their taste and quality.<br /><br />This tea is no exception.
5;Whoa!  My Dog REALLY Likes this Thing!;"When I received this ""Lickety Stik"", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it."
4;Pup likes it and so do we;Our dog has been quite happy with this one. The food tends to be a bit softer than some other varieties we have tried.
5;tasty treats;This is some really good ginger ale. reasonably priced, when you buy this it is safe to say good bye to store bought soda.
5;The King of BBQ Sauce;The King of Memphis BBQ sauce is the King of all BBQ sauces, in my opinion. The right combination of natural ingredients gives it a perfect taste for either ribs, chicken or pork.
5;Good stuff;Whether for sore muscles or high blood pressure this stuff is easy to use and seems to be absorbed quickly by the body.  It really helps.
5;Make your corn pop!;I discovered Kernel Seasons at Wal-Mart of all places..
3;Delicious but too little for price;We made two trips to Europe this year -- one to The Netherlands & Belgium and a second trip to Scotland.  Before leaving Belgium we found large bars of Cote d'Or chocolate in a local grocery and bought some to bring home.
5;Tea meant for a late evening;I love Earl Grey Tea. I have tried Tazo, Twinings and other Earl Grey teas and they are all good.
2;Marley Coffee Pods;I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended.
3;Chili-covered salt in a can;To be fair, this stuff is satisfying and great tasting (otherwise I'd have given it 1 star.)  Still, given a can is two servings, you get (for some people, more than) your daily limit of salt in one wallop.
5;Best thing ever!;"My dog suffers from an auto immune disorder which causes him to have to take a lot of meds. He also is on a novel protein diet and can't have many ""normal"" dog treats or food."
5;YAY! Sustainable garden on our counter;So far we have grown herbs, lettuce, tomatoes..
4;Great Buy!;I use to get my dogs bully sticks at a local pet store but they moved. The other pet stores that carry them charge more and they didn't like them very much.
5;HOT HOT HEAT! Great Taste;I bought this as a gift for my hot-sauce-loving husband. These are one of his favorite lines of hot sauce.
5;Food Should Taste Good ....;..
2;Inconsistent;One of six pieces of rind would pop.  The one that puffed up was great but not worth time or money.
5;they seem to help my son;My 7-year-old gets carsick, and we've started using both these and wristbands on twisty rides, and it seems to be helping.  Don't know if it's the bands or the gin-gins, but it's working so we're sticking with it.
5;Greatly loved at our house!;We are fans of the Special K bars in general at our house. We like several of the varieties including the lower calorie ones.
5;Great for your Cats!;My Isis loves salmon so I always buy food that contains salmon as the ingredient. When I visited PetSmart and saw Nature's Recipe I gave it try, it has salmon as the main ingredient and it had no meat-by-products or fillers - very important to watch!<br />She loves it!! before she would only eat at night and during the day she would eat more Whiskas Temptations snacks which all the cats seem to be highly addicted to, but ever since she tried Nature's Recipe with Salmon, she eats it during the day and night - i make sure to watch her weight but the bowl is empty the next day!! and she's eats less snacks during the day - even better!! I just purchased a second bag today and the lady at the store  - only found at Pet Stores -  told me that this is a very popular brand among cat owners especially the salmon recipe - true I noticed the shelves were almost empty.
1;Defective;I read the earlier reviews about the red top coming off and spraying in face, but, since Ortho, decided to risk it as an anomaly.<br /><br />However, on the second bottle the hose connection came off several times (tried to reattach it).
5;My Yorkies love this stuff!;After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth.
5;Great Northern popcorn portion packs;The great Northern popcorn popper we use these in seems to be used almost daily, since we have 8 and 10 year old girls, and their friends, who are always wanting a snack (specially after school). Although we also use the separate corn and oil also, the packs are just as good tasting, and sometimes a little handier when in a hurry, or out of the separate ingredients.
4;Tasty;The Cinnamon Roll flavors are not quite as good as the other Larabars.  There is just not enough cinnamon for my tastes.
1;Low Quality Ingredients;This product used to be made in Brazil and was of a higher quality.  My dog would chew these rawhide rolls for several days.
2;Figures Don't Lie, But Liars Figure;Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.
4;mmmmm;delicious, especially for a fan of sweet beef jerky..
5;Very Effective!;This tea works surprisingly well at controlling PMS symptoms - I make sure to always have some on hand.  I'm so glad that I discovered this!  I've shared it with several friends, and they are always amazed at how well it works.
5;love this chai;This is the best chai I have found for home use.  It's easy to use and delicious.
5;Joey loves these;My mini-poodle, Joey, has chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and thyroid disease.  She is allergic to beef and corn.
2;Not the best;Im not a fan, I bought the ones with and without the nibs, and I dont like either.  I didnt know what nibs were, but I dont think they enhance the chocolate at all.
4;Cripsy!;The apple flavour is the best out this whole pack. The banana feels sort of bizarre.
3;Could be richer;I do nor did now much about these K-cups. However the convience and simplicity would be welcomed by me.
4;Great Snack Item;I have been trying to find snacks with healthy ingredients and this fits the bill.<br />I got the variety mini bars and they all contain around 100 calories which is good for snacks.
1;Still shipping BPA containing stock;I just ordered this product hoping that Amazon was carrying/shipping their newly BPA-free stock. I ordered many different types of Earth's Best jarred baby foods from Amazon, and unfortunately, the Sweet Potatoes that I received ( April 5 2012 ) were the old stock that contain BPA in the lids.
4;One of the better low carb cereals;This is one of the better low carb cereals I have tried.  I eat it most everyday with some splenda and unsweetened almond or soymilk.
5;The Truth About Vitamin C In Raw Cacao;Hello Raw Cacao Lovers!<br /><br />Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao:<br /><br />Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e.
4;great flavor;if you are into decaf and looking for a bold coffee flavor this is a great pick. Makes a nice cup of coffee in the morning, even without the caffeine to get you going.
3;Not your typical Newtons;My children taste tested these and only one of them liked them.  The cookies were crisp, so if you envisioned these to be like a soft, chewy fig newton cookie, that is something that you should know.
4;Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it;I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.
5;great large treat!;My dog loves these because they are food. I love them because they have no beef, which my dog is allergic to.
5;ships super fast, great salt;I purchased this salt on recommendation from a doctor (Dr. Harry Wilson) who has been doing hair mineral analysis for 40 ('ish?) years and has overseen more than 40K patients hair mineral analysis results since the 70's.
5;Good decaf choice!;I was intrigued by the name of the coffee, and it lives up to the hype.  I enjoy it both hot and over ice, and it fulfills both requirements nicely.
1;Good product but order short;I order 160 K-cups and received 9 boxes of 16..
3;You Do The Math...;These peanuts are marked to be priced 2/$1.00 however Amazon is selling them 108 for $56.
5;Best Vegetarian Sausage Mix;I have tried several vegetarian sausage mixes and this one is by far the best. It is easy to use and cooks up just like real sausage would.
3;doesn't taste like hazelnut;While it didn't taste like hazelnut at all to me, I like this product. I just mixed it in with the regular unflavored.
5;Great peanuts, great value;We use to get Virginia peanuts from family up there, and this was the first year that I bought online and from this company.  The virginia gourment peanuts were exactly what we expected.
1;Terrible!;"I sent this one back!!!  First the color is not as shown.  The pudding is a ""gray"" color (how appetizing is that!) not the vanilla color as shown."
5;Fiber Packed Oatmeal;My wife and I have really enjoyed Silver Palate's oatmeal.  With 5g of fiber in just 1/3 cup of oatmeal makes it the most fiber-filled oatmeal we have come across.
5;BEST EVER;These are fantastic.  They're not too sweet, just right.
5;Great Hot & Sour, the easy way;"OH!<br />What a grrreat surprise.  We had tried, and loved their chicken noodle mix and our little grandson, Dylan, exclaimed, ""that is the best chicken soup in the World""."
5;Delicious!;Easy to make.  Extra noodles, mmmmm.
5;Serious coffee drinker;"I have to start by saying I am a ""picky"" coffee drinker and instant coffee was never found in my home. I received an offer for a free sample and I thought oh what the heck so I tried it and actually found it to be very good."
5;great;You can't mess this yeast up.  One of my packages was ripped open however, and I have not received a response to resolve this issue.
3;OVERPRICED.;i thought this was a deal at the time and then later found out i could get these k-cups for 1/2 as much else where. coffee was good.
1;pieces too big;I believed that I was ordering small pieces which I could use in baking or cream cheese and ginger sandwiches.  The pieces are much too big for this purpose and they are not really crystallized ginger, they are soggy cubes of sugar coated junk.
5;Best SF hot drink EVER!;I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.
5;Excellent for my Dane;Fed this to our weimaraner and she did great with it, lived over 12 years.  Recently rescued a Great Dane, and she loves, loves, loves this food!  She was eating Royal Canin Giant Breed dry when we got her.
3;Normally love these bars;Normally I love these chocolate chip oatmeal bars and would give them 5 stars.  They're chewy and delicious and a healthy snack compared to lots of other snack choices.
5;Our Dogs Love Them;We have two dogs, a chihuahua and a beagle.  Both of them love the Boost Bites Treats.
4;Good in a pinch!;We normally don't eat this type of food, but it looked interesting. I always liked the Velveeta-style macaroni and cheese products over the powdered.
5;Great Starbucks Coffee at Home!;As coffee lovers know, it is sometimes hard to get the same flavor and consistency of brand names at home.  In the case of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee this is NOT the case.
5;Delicious!;Great bars, delicious, easy to order and would def. order again.
5;Great Product;Great for making tea and recipes.  Less fuss than tearing open packets or measuring out graunular product.
5;Healthy cats;Both of my cats eat Iams Proactive Health Adult Original with Chicken exclusively. Both are healthy with little to no hairballs or digestive problems.
5;Great product!;I've tried other green tea brands, such as Bigelow and so far I love STASH. Its taste is wonderful and very natural.
5;sweet;"Great product good value fast shiping <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great Biscuits!;My puppy received these biscuits as a Christmas present from his Mom.  I don't normally purchase my dog food or treats online, but I will buy these again.
5;Yummm!... what a nice treat!;Let me start by saying that I can't stand hot chocolate mixes that you add water to ..
5;A terrific breakfast cereal;I have eaten this for years both for breakfast as well as for a snack. This is not super sugary like the junk cereals aimed at children, and for me the sweetness is just right.
3;Better from the store;I first purchased these cookies at our local health-food store and fell in love with them. They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside--heaven.
5;Dogs love these;It is hard to find Greenies at a good price. This was the best price that i have found recently.
5;Wow!;I was definitely skeptical about trying powdered peanut butter.  Grew up with Peter Pan and as a choosy adult, have been choosing Creamy Jif for a decade, but just had to try this based on 85% less fat and all the amazing reviews.
5;The ONLY Soy Sauce Alternative our Picky Eater will EAT!;Our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to Gluten, Casein & Soy when she was 18 months old.  Unfortunately, one of her favorite food treats was rice with soy sauce.
5;Great Stuff for Dogs with Allergies;I own two dogs and three cats and I feed them exclusively Instinct for their species.  After reviewing many products and trying raw (too hard) I've settled on Instinct for my pets as to one of the best foods to buy.
5;Yum;This is by far the best chocolate milk i have ever had. Its so freaking GOOD.
5;Fantastic!;I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo.
1;Watch expiration dates!1;1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats.
4;Good product for a good price;We have been working to control the cost of coffee, which has been on the rise recently. Maxwell House, a good coffee for everyday use, fit the bill, especially with Amazon's scheduling ability.
5;When they say whole they mean WHOLE!;Another excellent product.  This reminds me of a dish we make back home, in the Philippines.
5;Chai Tea;I bought these instead of the K-cup version because of the price.  It tastes exactly the same.
5;Much better than other baked chips;These are my favorite chips.  Very crunchy and tasty.
5;This has been the best food for our dogs.;This has been the best food for our dogs. They are more active, look healthier, and have firm, small stools.
5;Some of these reviews are ridiculous...  It's great - period;I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, nutrition freak, hippy, etc..
5;Delicious!;I was hesitant to try these 'healthy' treats but I am surely glad that I did. They are really tasty and supposedly good for you and I LOVE the wonderfully rich chocolate flavor.
4;Nestle hot cocoa mix double chocolate meltdown;"This is such a good hot cocoa mix with more flavor than most because of the ""double chocolate"". I'm frustrated because I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores any more."
5;Just Too Funny;These pooping Reideers are just to funny. Can't wait till I take them over to my Boss's office for her and her daughter to open them up.
5;Great snack;Easy on the waistline, easy to pack and go.<br />Flavorful, crisp, good for the munchies.
4;Fast & Easy!;Want an easy dinner fast?  Than this is what you need!  I bought a pack of pork chops, threw them one at a time into a ziplock bag with the mix and in 5 minutes had 6 chops ready to bake.  This package does say it will make 6 pork chops, and it did, but the last one was pretty skimpy in coating and I had been very careful to not overdo the other 5.
5;Best Coffee Ever!;Green Mountain Dark Magic is delicious coffee! I love starting my day off with this coffee. I highly recommend you try this coffee.
5;The best of Starbucks.;I now almost exclusively drink Starbucks Columbian. Taste is full, bright, rich, fresh, not bitter.
1;Tastes fine, but 2X price of buying soda at store.;First, I LOVE the sodastream machines. They work great for sparkly water anytime you need it.
1;Over Rated (way over priced)Frozen meats;For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.
5;Gingerly Delicious!!!;These have been my favorite ginger cookies for about a year now. They're getting harder to find as they gain popularity - my local store is frequently sold out.
5;wonderful coffe;I was looking for something new in a flavor I thought I would like and came across this brand and flavor. It is now one of my favorites.
4;I love Mounds!;What can I say? They're mini mounds and they're delicious. Every one I've opened so far has tasted very fresh, however, one bag's contents seemed to have been crushed at some points and the bars were a bit mushed.
5;good stuff;this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs.
5;Great on  Spanish Tapas;I love Spanish Tapas and love making them for family and frieds. This Paprika or Spanish Pimenton is great.
4;Very Good Tea;I have enjoyed the Stash Orange Spice Black Tea for years.  While I like and drink it often, I actually enjoy the Lipton version better.
2;Disappointed;I had high hopes for this tea, but I have to agree with the reviewers who called it bland. I normally drink Twinings Ceylon OP, English Breakfast, or PG Tips, and those are all much more flavorful.
2;Are these all the k cups that come out of other packages?;I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.
1;Simply BLECH!;If you enjoy gnawing on rubber tires and the taste of plastic and chemicals, you'll love this product. Otherwise, STAY AWAY.
5;Great product, fast shipping;Excellent product that we tried while traveling overseas but had difficulty locating in the U.S.
3;DRY soda;Most flavors were so subtle they were nearly nonexistent. The vanilla bean, rhubarb, and juniper berry had some flavor and I liked them
5;These are the best in my opinion;I only use americolor, i think they work the best, especially with dark colors. I was very excited to find them at such a great price.
4;Good Flavor - Not High Energy;The flavor of this product is smooth and enjoyable.  The honey comes through in just the right amount.
5;Mild Breakfast Blend Coffee;Just what we were looking for, a mild mellow coffee blend!  Coffee K-Cups were not out dated.  Will be buying again and again.
5;Great Granola!;Luv, luv, this granola..
1;Terrible quality;I am a regular matcha drinker, and have been buying matcha from Mitsuwa or Sunrise Mart NYC for years, but bought this Republic of Tea matcha at the local Whole Foods. The colour of the tea is nothing like in the image on the package, it is a dull green (which means more oxidation and stems).
5;Scrumptious!;Just bought my first pouch today at my local Publix and they're already gone!  It's hard to describe what a treat these are with the combination of sweet and savory, salt, vanilla, and pomegranate flavors. I just wish it was an organic product, but flavor-wise, no complaints! The price on Amazon is 20% less than at my grocery store.
5;Makes and Englishman happy;My sister married an English man. He grew up on these.
3;It is Just OK;Doesn't taste that great. Preferred dunkin donuts original blend compared to this.
5;great coffee, great price;Very delicious coffee and a special bargain when purchased from Amazon.  I love the easy open boxes and will always purchase my t-discs from Amazon.
3;2 important FYIs!;1. The box is very small.
5;The cats love it....;I used to buy this at Whole Foods, which seems to have discontinued it.  Glad to find it at Amazon!<br /><br />This is one of the few foods all 3 cats will eat.
4;Pretty darn close...;"Be aware that this review regards Stagg's ""Classic"" style chili, as they make several varieties. We prefer the ""Silverado"" style, but Stagg made the labels so close we bought the wrong one."
5;Sea salt and Vinegar Chips;These chips are delicious, the first time I have have tried Pop Chips brand chips. Different taste then regular chips but there not bad.
5;candy lovin;I have always been a fan of trolli candy and when I saw this my mouth immediately dropped. that box lasted me 2 weeks while eating about 6-10 worms a day.
2;Varies in quality;I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account.
5;Great product.;This is the old time cornmeal that I was looking for.  This is the<br />right grind for good bread as well as just for cooking.
5;Fabulous, not too sweet, well toasted;OMG, shredded wheat that is actually toasted, lightly sweetened, doesnt melt in your bowl before you get to the bottom. Truly delish and I'm not a cereal fan.
5;Very pleasantly surprised;I was raised in the midwest and have not acquired a taste for the strong seaweed flavor.  A friend gave me a sample of this salad and I wanted more!  This is not overpowering and was slightly sweet.
5;Dog loves it;I have not tried this product personally, but my dog has, and he loves it, and is aging well. He's getting a bit grey, but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago.
1;Looks Better than it Tastes;This soup is a bummer.  I just ate it for lunch, and it wasn't good.
5;Easiest way to get the best tea;We love this tea, and everyone else must too because the stores always seem to be out of it. This is a great way for us to get lots of something we use everyday sent right to our door for free.
5;One of the dog's favorite treats;My dogs go crazy when they smell these.  They are great for training too.
4;Superior Dog Food;Reading the ingredients of the Beneful dog food product reveals that there is a solid basis for nutrition for your dog.  The main ingredient is corn and then chicken.
5;Awesome Flavor;My husband and I are obsessed with this coffee..
5;Nutella is addictive!;One spoonful (the best way to eat it) and you'll be in heaven. Maybe you'll want to put it on graham crackers, bagels, or bake up some Nutella cupcakes.
5;absolutly delicious;I bought the onion flavored crackers and they are delicious.  Very nutty flavor, with a hint of onion, crunchy, crispy and most importantly nutricious.
4;I would buy these!;I have heard about these bars, but never tasted them. I will look for them on sale to buy now.
1;Chocolate Orange too dry.;I thought these were way too dry AND the nuts seemed to cut my mouth.  That combination turned me off to these bars completely.
1;Disgusting;This product has virtually no taste, beyond that of salt.<br /><br />My digestive system reacted as negatively as my taste buds and, after eating this product, I suffered somewhat, in ways I would rather not detail.
5;Ginger chews R good;Very good and a good value in the case pack. These chews are a favorite for the entire office, especially for the secretaries that are pregnant.
4;Another Good Stash Tea;Another good Stash tea.  Very pleasant, light flavor with minimal aftertaste (sometimes use two bags to get stronger taste) that's especially good for upset stomach.
5;It warmed me up;I did a little bit more research online before taking this tea..
2;Great if you don't know what Hot Cocoa should taste like!;I bought this for my husband and boy were we disappointed, to say the least. My two sons, 5 and 3, even didn't like it.
5;best baby food maker;This is a great product and easy to use.  You just steam your food and process in one.
4;doesn't melt in the sun!;I've been living and riding in Florida for 6 years and came across Sport Beans as a great alternative to PowerBars, Gels, Blocks and Gu's a few years or so ago.  They are great.
3;OK, but there is better;Coco Lopez is OK, but Coco Casa is much better.  Unfortunately Coco Casa is harder to find so when I run out I often have to resort to Coco Lopez.
5;Yum! My favorite morning coffee;Always brews great in my tall cup. Many other coffees tend to be too weak when you use the larger cup settings but not this one.
4;Good product - better price elsewhere;This is a cute product to use in place of sprinkles - the bright colors of candy coating look great, and the chocolate center keeps them from being overly sweet.<br /><br />However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this).
5;Best macaroni and cheese ever!;I LOVE Annie's mac and cheese.  I eat it several times a week.
5;The real deal;So happy with this. Came as promised and we got a full box.
5;Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Rings;Excellent product. My dog loves these rings and devotes his full attention to his Busy Budy Bone when I put the rings on it.
4;Green Tea Gelcaps;Really good product. Contains all the health benefits of green tea.
5;Excellent product;Excellent and yummy.  Everyone that had one of these LOVED it.
5;Doggie delight;I have 2 boxers and mix a 1/2 a can along with their dry food for each..
5;My Favorite Hot Sauce;This is an amazing hot sauce, it has the heat and a great flavor. I use it on pretty much everything, usually stick about 6 drops in ramen, put it in chili or mix a bit in with wing sauce.
5;Favorite coffee;We've been drinking this coffee for over a year now.  It has a strong flavor what is very enjoyable.
1;Why pay for organic soup that has BPA in it?;My daughter loved this soup, but I was disappointed to discover that Earth's Best uses a resin liner on their canned foods that contains BPA - a toxic chemical for children.  While the company says the levels are low and within acceptale government standards, BPA is known to leech even more into acidic products like diced tomatoes, or tomato soup.
4;Just One Flaw;I like the taste of this oatmeal, and the nutritional profile is outstanding.  The only complaint I have is that in almost every bowl of oatmeal I have made (and I have used 9 boxes so far), there is at least one black, twig-like structure.
5;Garden Fungicide;Arrived on time and worked great, I would recommend to all. this was a smooth purchase, no problems at all.
5;EXCELLENT LIFE SAVER;EXACTLY what I was looking for ~ The .5 ounce size pixy stix = 13 carbohydrates ~ Which is about what my daughter, who has Type 1 Diabetes, needs to treat a low blood sugar.
5;Another happy dog and owner;I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget.
5;FOR ALL YOU 1 STAR PEOPLE;"HOW DARE YOU RATE THIS 1 STAR SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE ""CALORIES"". READ THE BOX, NOWHERE DOES IT SAY ""DIET""."
5;Calling it just ketchup is a disservice;I finally ordered some after debating for awhile, I mean it's just ketchup right? How far from reality that was. The spicy is now my go to condiment for everything, it is so much more than just ketchup.
3;Useful especially if you have a small kitchen, one safety concern though;I live in a small apartment and don't have room for lots of gadgets (not even a microwave). I find this appliance to be worth the counter space.
5;its a good product;I had to buy a bunch of these for my wedding as well filled the boxes with these. I feel that it was a great product, as it is M&M's! haha however, you can buy the same thing as a store, it seemed cheaper to purchase large amounts this way.
5;Wheat Germ with Cinnamon and Flaxseed;Love this product! I use it all the time in my muffin and bread mixes and it doesn't change the taste or texture. Plus, it adds extra health benefits like fiber and antioxidants.
5;Bigelow French Vanilla Tea;A smooth, delightful vanilla flavor, with a peaceful aroma for an easy morning wakeup. I stumbled upon this tea while on a cruise and could just not get away from it.
5;Tastes Great;I really liked this EVOO.  Thought it had a great flavor.
5;I really like it;"I bought this at my local Japanese store, and the shopkeeper told me that she likled it but that it was difficult to eat ""straight"".  I tried it and it was difficult to eat."
5;Likely the best nut bar I've ever tasted;I had purchased these when they were about $15.50 for a box of 12 and although that is a bit pricey compared to a box of bars you can get from any other brand, it's much cheaper compared to the $3.
5;no issues with expiration date here!;I've seen multiple reviews re: the expiration date is too close..
5;Excellent Tea;Excellent Tea. I enjoy a cup every now and then.
3;Price Vs. Flavor;I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great.
5;Favorite spice for cooking;This is my must-have spice for all my cooking.  Not hot but lots of flavor.
1;Mold all over! Be careful;This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.
1;Just coffee;As ground coffee, this product is OK
4;The best yet!;This color is the BEST yet so far for cakes. When you mix black with white frosting, you easily get many shades of gray until you use a large amount of coloring.
4;Very smoky;This organic coffee has a very bold, smoky, almost burnt taste to it.  It reminds me alot of the flavor of Starbucks coffee.
4;Ginger peach longevity tea;The ginger is very subtle--I'm not convinced I taste it at all--and the peach is soft and delicious, the black tea exquisite. What also strikes me is the smoothness of the blend.
5;Love them!;I had been using the 5 hour energy, when I thought I'd give these a try.  I LOVE THEM!! The flavor is much better and it works within minutes!  The only thing I don't like is that I can drink only 1/2 of the 5hour & it says it keeps for up to 3 days.
4;Tasty alternative to getting it directly from a coconut;On a trip to Panama, I became a fan of coconut water, having drank it from a ginormous coconut, freshly prepared.  I've been buying the canned version occasionally at the store and have been trying to decide which brand I like best.
5;Nylabone;We've used nylabones for years.  Our lab retrievers love them.
5;Delish;Love chocolate coconut water (even though I hate the taste of plain coconut water.) This is great for the day after too much wine, when you have a cold or any other time that you need some serious hydration.
5;Freaking YUMMY;5 pounds of gummi bears. WOW great deal.
5;Coconut Oil;I love this product. I use it three ways.
5;Kick in the @#@$%;Ive tried many KCups. I bought a Green Mountain Bold Variety pack and it had a few of these gems in it.
2;6 month old puppy did not really go for this;"I have a 6 month old Pomeranian puppy who loves chewing.  I introduced this product to him, along with a compressed rawhide stick, and a Himalayan Dog Chew (<a href=""http://www."
5;delicious gluten-free snack;These date and nut bars are delicious.  It is hard to find tasty gluten-free snacks but these bars are good.
1;Looks like 70% of Cherry Tomato Reviews are NEGATIVE;I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes.
5;Just like homemade!;We used to make our own cat food & this is a excellent substitute!  It looks & smells wonderful!  Get out your fork for the Chinese chicken or your spoon for the Chicken Pot Pie & dig in!<br />We have six cats & all six of them loved this!<br />The Chinese chicken is shredded white meat & a little bit of carrots in broth.  Mostly shredded meat.
4;Smoked Herring;These smoked herring, packaged in a can that is in the box, are very good. They are<br />not packed in tons of oil, so are much healthier for those of us who want to maintain<br />a reasonable weight.
5;Organic Orgain;After my first drink I was hooked on Orgain creamy chocolate fudge.<br />I had been looking for an organic protein shake and came upon this brand by accident.
5;Great product, dogs love them;My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.
2;New and NOT Improved;I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful.
4;Nice and strong - the way I like it.;I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).
5;My Cats Love It;I have fed my 10 month old Maine Coon brother cats Purina Pro Plan catfood for about a year now and I love how it makes their fur feel and amount of energy they have. They are very furry cats so I usually buy the adult hairball management Purina Pro Plan kind of cat food for them, but they were not disappointed with the chicken and rice flavor at all.
4;made my Saturday morning.;"I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being ""really good""."
3;Overpriced;The Yuban Dark Roast is, I think, an outstanding tasting ground coffee, but is WAY OVERPRICED on the Amazon site..
5;Hurts so good;"I love this sauce!  I have quite a collection of hot sauces including <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;Disappointed;In the past, I've ordered Turkish Antep Pistachios from several places, including Zenobia and Bayside Candy (If I recall that name correctly), and Superior Nut had a far inferior product.  They just seemed much drier and far less flavorful than the others that I was used to.
1;Did not like this flavor.;I picked this flavor up based on lots of positive feedback.  I did not like it at all.
5;Great Snack for Gluten free kids;Sometimes it is hard to find a quick snack for Gluten free kids.  These pretzels are the best of all the GF pretzels we have tried.
5;Delicious!;You  can have your cereal and avoid wheat with these amazing flakes. I just ordered another two boxes.
5;my dogs love it;I have spent 2 years trying to find some sort of dog food that won't break the bank, that's made with dog health in mind, and that my dogs actually like. having said that, I was truly skeptical about buying this, simply because of the price.
4;Our dogs' favorite!;When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat.
5;Can't diet without it;I'm on diet that requires drinking 8 glasses of water per day. I couldn't do it without MIO flavor enhancers.
5;I'm addicted;I bought these every week when I lived in Portland, now that I am in the Midwest I can't find my favorite breakfast bar. Loved getting them this way, they are fresher and even better than from the store.
5;five paws;I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a long heritage of discriminating taste. Pet'n Shape products are my most favored treats,and I am especially fond of Chik 'n Breast.
5;Great snack cracker, crispy!!!;"I don't do as many junk foods now.<br />I know I shouldn't give a lot of stars, then they wont be available like some other items I want now, I keep seeing ""Currently unavailable."
4;Cheese Rounds Cheddar;These are good, nice cheese flavor. If your out of croutons break up afew for your salad, or float them in onion soup.
4;I love them but they are pricey;They smell fantastic. I use one every time I fly, and whenever I need to freshen up.
1;"2010 ""new recipe"" is bland and disappointing";"Here's the email I wrote to the Lindt company after my first taste of the ""new"" version:<br /><br />Hello,<br />I have loved your 70% Excellence bar since I first discovered it 3 years ago. The slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful."
5;Yum!;I searched high and low for a good multigrain cereal and found it in Country Choice. We love the texture and how it's not gloppy like oatmeal.
5;Fine Oil;This Oil is great for those of you that don't like the taste of Olive Oil.  It contains more Omega 3 & 6 and a higher operating cooking range than Olive Oil.
5;Great texture and flavor;These are a great and easy way for getting all your fruit servings. Also great for dieters on the go.
5;Tastes Good;We have been using enjoy life products for awhile due to life threatening food allergies. During a walk for FAAN they gave out samples of this cookie.
5;Delicious seasonal favorite;Love this coffee.  It just tastes like the holidays.
5;PB2;After watching a lady who lost a great deal of weight demonstrate it on Dr. Oz, I decided to try it.
4;Tasty, but very sweet;Like it's counterpart Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey is sweet and crunchy with a nutty flavor.  This version is in a flake form, which gives a different texture than the O's shape of the other.
1;VERY disappointing;I ordered a case of this triple mocha expresso.<br />Wow, What a disappointment.
4;Variety, with 25% Cocoas and 75% Chocolate Coffees;Got this order today.  Comes in a cardboard box that is utilitarian, but not something you'd want to keep out in view on the kitchen countertop and take K-cups out of.
5;A Staple in my house;I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!<br /><br />A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter.
5;CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi;I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound.  I did alot of research and read alot of labels.
5;One of my favorite pet products;"I first received the scented bags as a ""bonus"" with my regular bags.  I loved them so much that I was bummed when I had to switch to the ""regular"" ones I actually bought."
2;Pissed, cheap cost down containers;Don't bother buying this product.  The price is nice as a solution to buying breakfast everyday at work, but the cheap containers that kelloggs is using now suck.
3;Rubbery With Good Flavor;As the title of my review suggests:  I thought this jerky was a little rubbery but had good flavor.  Overall, I would say it's okay.
2;neither dog nor I excited.;I picked this up to have on hand---seems we always have a stray to feed, extra dog food is a lovely bonus!  Overall : Meh.  Dogs will eat it.
5;This is a great product!;I absolutely love this product. It has replaced a number of different spices that I normally used.
1;Melted;Arrived completely melted.  This was strange because it was not hot where it arrived, it must have melted during transit or even where it had been stored.
5;Highly recommended;Ferrara Pan Candy Company was founded in 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. In 1962, the company hit on a new great tasting candy - Lemonheads.
5;Hip Action for Cats - Excellent treatment!;My vet put my cat, Ranger, on Hip Action after Ranger started limping and we discovered his patella was slipping off his knee joint.  It was painful to watch him limp around the house and up stairs.
5;Awesome Gluten Free Cereal!;"I just want to say ""Thank you HappyBaby!"".  Hallelujah!  As a mom who has a gluten free baby who also only eats organic, I was delighted to find this product and what's more important?  My son really likes it!  The cereal melts in baby's mouth, so not much of a choking hazard and it is just crunchy enough that it's nice on those sore, teething gums."
5;Great coffee at a great price!;I love this coffee!  It has a bold flavor and you wouldn't guess it's decaf.  I'm a nursing mother and prefer not to drink caffeinated coffee for now, but this coffee gives me the fix I need.
5;Great product;"They call them ""bitter almonds"" but to me they just tasted like nuts, not bitter at all, just like a generic nut.  I eat several in the AM and several in the PM."
4;Delicious;I love spiced cider so I wanted to try this brand.  The spices can be a little intense at first, but its really a delicious cider.
5;Dangerously delicious;Heed my advice!  When you go to eat this, measure out your portion, seal the bag and put it under a timed lock.  It's a pretty high calorie snack and terribly, terribly delicious and I think I got about 3 servings out of the bag instead of the.
3;Small and short lived;When I initially opened the package, I was disappointed. I thought the bones would be larger
5;My favorite (non-caffeinated) chai;I wrote the following review for the Black Tea version, but it also applies to the Redbush which I started drinking since getting pregnant and trying to avoid caffeine:<br /><br />I've been a chai afficionado for a while, and even more so since my trip to Nepal 2 years ago. There I was able to taste chai both in restaurants and in homes, and I have to say that Yogi's chai is the best and most authentic one I've ever tried.
5;My favorite;I recently purchased a Keurig and of course wanted to have a variety of coffees and teas to try. I searched and found several coffees and this was one of them.
5;My favorite Tea!!! No other Raspberry compares!!!!;My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping.
2;Not Twinings!;It was an impulse purchase, new product  to me, and inexpensive, Dilmah Earl Grey tea. Figured I'd give it a try.
5;"Should be called ""Toasty Tasty Cherry""";Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.
5;the best!;I bought this product because I had a coupon it was a little expensive but I give one a week to my dog.  My dog loves them and if she could speak she would say please give me one a day.
1;Very Disappointed!;We placed an order for some Lindt Lindor truffles 2 weeks before Christmas that were PROMISED to arrive before Christmas - They did not!!!<br /><br />WE are NOT happy with the delivery service from this company.<br /><br />Plus, have not been offered any appolgies or anything to make up for this huge letdown.
1;Terrible. Couldn't finish bag.;I just purchased this jerky from a local store because they recently quit carrying the kind I like in my town. I ate a piece and thought it was disgusting.
1;Blargh;Interesting concept and package, but even a single drop of this stuff in a glass of water tastes..
1;not sure what happened;Never thought it would be possible to have bad cotton candy..
5;What a relief!;I had been purchasing the So Delicious brand which has many more ingredients than this and must be refrigerated. I don't like their tetra-pak one.
4;only thing to change..;The only problem with the product is the size for its cost, increase the size of the container.  It is great for shakes and protien mixes.
5;Has replaced Kitty Kaviar as the favorite cat treat in my household;The two cats who eat treats loved Kitty Kaviar, but sometimes I noticed they sneezed a lot afterward.  The larger Bonita (tuna) flakes are easier for them to pick up and eat without getting them up their noses and they seem to prefer the bigger size, too.
5;simply peas;I like these peas for having nothing but the pea in the can. Read the sodium levels on a can of beans these days, might as well drink sea water.
5;pain reducer;If you have an overactive immune system/arthritis you will love this tea as it reduces stiffness and pain. I am also gradually losing weight without dieting.
5;Kids loved it;My Children absolutely loved this.  They invariably chose it for their lunchboxes everyday.
4;Marley Coffee;I didn't realize this was a single brew coffee.  However, I cut open four of the filter packs and used it in my drip coffee maker.
5;Good stuff;Great refreshing drink. Replenishes electrolytes naturally after workout.
5;great coffee;jet fuel coffee is the best coffee i ever had the taste is great it gets your mornings off to a great start.and you dont have to buy a plane ticket.
2;Great Taste - Poor Packaging;I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them.
5;Fantastic!;I live in Texas. While visiting our daughter in SD recently, she purchased these at her local grocery store.
1;False Advertising;I was pointed to this item after a Google search for sodium free tuna.  The review said that the item contaned 0 mg's of sodium and since I am on a very low sodium diet I purchased a quantity of 24.
5;Good stuff!!;Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.
3;Nothing Special;"Good Earl Grey Tea but nothing about it was special. The ""double bergamot"" went unoticed."
4;Smooth;I found this flavored coffee didn't have the sharp bite of most Starbucks coffee. It's smoother and far less boisterous than the regular Starbucks.
5;Thailand Revisited;Drinking this tea makes me feel like I'm back in Thailand, just after getting a full body Thai massage.  Soothing and relaxing with just a hint of natural sweetness, it is one of my fav teas to unwind with.
5;Pure and natural;I have psoriasis of the scalp and this product works beautifully at moisturizing my hair. It barely has a taste and it doesn't irritate the skin.
2;Oddly colored pear juice;"This drink was so weird, I had to review it.  The front says ""Naturally Flavored Snapple Apple with other natural flavors juice drink."
3;Great.........For A Snack {3 Stars};This stuff is great as a snack.  As a breakfast cereal?  Not so much.
5;Very good product;Product was very good and what I expected.  It is difficult to find locally.
5;Terrific product!!  Delicious!;My daughter-in-law is Japanese and has been sending us this rice is small quantities for years.  It was nice to see a large bag available on Amazon.
5;Full of Flavor With Out The Need for Sugar;"I started drinking this Wild Sweet Orange tea when I was trying to reduce the amount of coffee (plus sugar) and ""boring"" teas (plus sugar or honey). This is a very flavorful tea that can be enjoyed without adding sugars and is also great in the afternoon (or evening) for those who are too sensitive to Caffeine."
5;Love the Dark French Roast;I had almost decided that I needed to stop drinking coffee because of the frequent heartburn I battled with.  I was so happy to find Puroast
5;Just as delicious, but not as costly, as Chips Ahoy Chewy cookies;"The ""Soft 'n Chewy"" Chips Deluxe cookies are highly underrated. Often overshadowed by Chips Ahoy's Chewy Cookies in marketing and sales, ""Soft 'n Chewy"" cookies from Chips Deluxe are worth trying if you enjoy cookies that are, well, soft and chewy."
5;Peppermint Tea;This is quite possibly the best peppermint tea we have found.  The surprise was that we ordered it in a hurry and received two pounds rather than two ounces!  Two pounds of tea is an amazingly large amount.
5;Great after Bikram Yoga;I have one of these after Bikram Yoga and it lifts me right back up after a tough 90 minute workout. It tastes great, it's light, and it's healthy.
5;outstanding product;Tasted these bars in a health food store and grabbed several flavors ot Kind bars to try.  The chocolate cherry cashew ones are like crack -- totally addicting!  Amazing blend of tastes makes me feel like I'm sneaking a candy bar instead of a healthy, wholesome friut and nut bar.
5;Great product, but overpriced;While a little pricey, these Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bars are probably my favorite KIND bar and I've virtually tried them all.  I've have consistency issues with the Yogurt bars so I avoid them now.
5;very pleasant flavor and good quality;Milk Thistle is said to be good for the liver. It has a very mellow and pleasant flavor.
3;OK- but no real energy burst;After reading the other reviews, I was thinking I'd better be careful lest I end up beet red and running around my office like a rat on acid.  Well no problems there.
4;Sweet Potato Review;We've tried several types of sweet potato treats but this is the best we've found so far, mainly because it's the only one our yorkie will eat:) Others are so hard/rubbery you can't even cut them with a knife. This brand is chewable for bigger dogs and tearable for our yorkie plus she loves the flavor.
2;75% of the bread sticks were broken into pieces;75% of the Torino Classical grissini (thin) bread sticks were broken into pieces.  Otherwise the flavor is just a LITTLE better than the other grissini brands.
5;Best Bar;These are my favorite bars ever. The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful! Very filling! These are hard to find in the stores.
4;My cats love the tuna flavored IAMS.;I am no longer able to find original IAMS with tuna in my grocery store and I can only buy it online.  My cats love it.
5;Zesty Deliciousness in a Can;I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.
5;Melt in Your Mouth;I opened the box when I had two friends visiting!  They went home with at least two packages each as they were having weekend guests.  I still have a bunch.
4;More Yummy Kindness;I love this product! I love the strength of the coconut  and the combination of a crunchy almond. My Mom and Dad are now fans too.
5;My doge love this ham.;I reviewed this item earlier.As I said,the six pack is the best way to buy this product.
5;Our ten year old doxie;Our ten year old doxie..
2;Nice Coffee - Not Much Flavor;"Nice Coffee if you like a bolder coffee.<br />Did not have much ""mudslide"" flavor."
1;Artificial nonsense in a fancy package;I was going to use the Betty Crocker mix in my cupboard but thought this Dean Jacobs product must be better quality/flavour as the package looked so fancy.  Plus, it cost 5x as much as Betty Crocker.
3;Real fruit, unreal flavors.;"I was expecting the  strawberry flavored CLIF kid Organic Twisted Fruit to contain strawberries, but the ingredient list doesn't mention strawberries at all. It is made from organic apple puree and apple juice concetrate and ""organic flavors"" (whatever that means)."
1;ASPARTAME!!!;I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.
5;She loves it!!;I adopted my dog because her previous owner had passed away.  My dog had been eating canned food and her teeth looked terrible.
5;Oh yeah!;My family is originally from Indiana and Ohio but moved to Georgia when I was very young. I can remember though how we loved this hot cereal.
5;Lipton lemon/sugar ice tea is the best;Our family loves this ice tea and we drink it by the gallon.  Great time saver for making it with mix.
5;Great Tea @ Reasonable Price;I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas
5;Best cookies around;These are crispy cookies, not soft. If you like your cookies that way, they are the best packages cookies I've ever had.
4;Shotty Packaging;Ive been drinking coconut water my whole life and seriously LOVE the stuff.  When I first found VitaCoco all i could think was these guys are geniuses and somehow managed to create a coconut drink that actually tastes like the real coconut.
5;Best sugar alternative;This is really good stuff. I was looking for a healthy alternative to white sugar, and read that agave nectar and sucanut are not really that healthy after all.
5;Awesome!;Hands down, the best new snack I've tried in years!  Seriously, I will be ordering more of these immediately, as these did not last long around my house..
5;MMMMMMMMMMM;MMM..
5;Well shipped, loved by all;They were shipped in ICE. That's pretty cool.
5;Great Coffee;I've been using the Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods for more than a year now..
5;Good;The flavor is very vinegary and salty, just like the flavor on store bought chips! You can use it on anything, can't wait to try it on homemade chips. Very good product.
5;HOT CHIPS!;I am a huge fan of hot sauces and anything that is of intense heat. These chips are great but for snacking they can get a bit hot.
5;Perfect drink on a warm day!;I was very skeptical about buying this as I have never been a fan of any tea. I decided to give this a shot as I was looking for some new k-cups for my maker and for a new drink as I was getting tired for my packets of flavor added to water.
5;Yum;This spaghetti sauce tastes good and has nice chunks of veggies in it. It is pretty flavorful and I find that I don't have to add a lot of seasonings to it for it to taste good.
5;Absolutely awesome!;The package arrived in pristine condition, double packaged - in bubble wrap as well as a thick plastic wrapping. The bottles are not cracked or leaking etc.
5;As good as any of the coffee shops;After trying all the coffees that came as samples with my Keurig machine,<br />Timothy's World Cofee, Midnight Magic proved to be the best of a very good group. I found it be as satisfying as any coffee I have had at Starbucks, The Coffee Bean Etc.
4;Worked Well;This conditioner left my hair feeling very soft and moisturized after one use. The smell is kind of strong, but once your hair dries, it provides a really nice scent that lasts.
4;Nice, easy, good, fast;I am satisfied with the taste and the product.  It does what it says and while it is not the most gourmet, it is good for the money.
3;Good taste, but difficult to get out of package;I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.
2;Healthy but extremely low calorie per can (be careful not to underfeed your cat);"When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: ""feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight""."
5;Extra Bold, You Bet;Of all the K-Cups we have tried, and that's a bunch, this one is the hands down favorite for flavor and boldness.  This is the one the spoon stands up in, the jolt that brings you to life no matter what.
5;Delicious, soft water that seems to work well as an unsweetened Gatoraid substitute;When I tasted the Essentia water, I thought it had a smooth, soft taste. Not a crisp water
2;Just so-so;I prefer to have my ciders on the tart side but this was one just sweet. I like the Lipton one waaaay better.
5;Best EVOO!;used subscribe and save and was paying $13.50 for a liter! Better pricing than crappy supermarket brands.
4;Nice simple Chip;Good chips and like the fact that the small bag size keeps me from eating too many (unless I grab a 2nd bag). Healthier Chip in a snack sized bag.
5;what a value!!!;First of all, the sizes vary a bit, which in fact I love especially if you have different sized pups. Most of them are very thick with some smaller sized mixed in.
4;Satisfies a sweet potato tooth;Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.
5;COLLEGE STUDENT'S BEST FRIEND;These kept me healthy through college - a GREAT studying snack, because the fruit and nuts both keep you energized and facilitate brain function (at least that's what my nutritionist friend told me). End result was I graduated engineering in 3.
3;some are better than others;The vanilla, chocolate and irish cream are yummy. The others .
5;Wonderful healthy crunchy crackers!;I just love these crackers.  I am trying to loose weight and these crackers are the perfect snack - with anything!  I eat them with cream cheese and pineapple, peanut butter and homemade strawberry jam.
5;Awesome product!!;As it turns out Basil is extremely healthy and is listed on the World's Healthiest Foods list (google it)<br />I haven't tried this as plain pesto but I have added it to<br />Marinara sauce, beef and barley soup, and chicken barley soup, black bean and tempeh burrito fillings, and probably more things as I just grab stuff as I cook.<br /><br />I also have the tomato paste in a tube and it is good too, so much better than those silly cans where you have to decide of you want to refrigerate the leftovers or use the whole can when the recipe only calls for 2 tbs.
4;Works for me;I bought this on Amazon after getting it from the supermarket once, so I already knew that I was OK with the taste. Basically, it is definitely not as sweet as the normal version, but it tastes fine to me, and allows me to indulge on chocolate milk without some of the extra calories.
5;Amazing;Let me start by saying I am not a BBQ guy. One of my customers gave me a bottle of this stuff, and I couldn't believe how much I liked it! I find myself putting it on things I never put sauce on before.
2;Actually a Mystery Blend;Panama Boquete has been a favorite varietal of mine for a few years. On review of the Copper Moon label, it turns out this bag is actually a blend--and specifics of varietals included are not disclosed.
5;Barista Prima Italian Roast;Got this in a K Cup sampler, definitely on my reorder list.  Very smooth, no bitter after taste, dark coffee.
5;Great for the lunch box;I bought these fruit snacks for my daughter, who is an avid Angry Birds fan.  I like buying in bulk because it's cheaper, and they're handy in the lunch box.
2;healthy but not really tasty, and expensive;I think the product description didn't warn me sufficiently that these muffins are almost too healthy.  What really worried me was that they are so high fiber, you have to drink a glass of water with them, and if you eat more than one in a day, you'll probably have stomach problems.
3;Hmmm, where do I begin?;These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy.
1;Ew!;I buy little powdered cider packets at the store by the hot chocolate and occasionally simmer my own hot cider. My Grove Square Caramel Apple Cider was the third K-Cup I tried (I just got my machine for Valentine's Day).
4;Good but two problems - update;I just opened the tiny pack and made a bowl of their miso soup.  The good things is that the tofu, green onion and seaweed arent small.
5;Perfectly Delicious;I have been buying Kind Bars for over a year and must say each and every bar is wonderful. I use them as a snack or a breakfast and find it keeps me satisfied completely.
5;Lucy's Sugar Cookies;Great seller, fast shipping! I love these cookies! I have many allergies and I have no problems when eating these. I will be ordering more.
5;Wolfgang Puck coffee pods;I have now ordered this product twice since discovering it.  I love the pods and they work well with my Senseo coffee maker which has worked well daily since I bought it 8 years ago.
5;I laughed when I opened the package;I had been using this creamer from the bottle for many years, and this was my first time buying singles. The creamer is great, but what surprised me was the packaging.
2;I can't taste the peanut butter!  Cpt Crunch does it better;While captain crunch peanut butter cereal isn't organic and has preservatives, (yuck) they make the best-tasting<br /><br />Panda Puffs peanut butter cereal has almost no peanut butter taste.<br /><br />It may be healthier but when i buy peanut butter cereal i expect it to taste like it.
2;Not Starbucks quality;Very stale tasting, may have been caused by shelf life? Also very bold(strong), not the great tasting k-cup. Might be better off pick this up from your local store IMO.
3;Good;I like this coffee but definitely not a fave. In my opinion, it tastes okay but you might love it.
3;Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!;These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts.
5;Coffee with  joy;"As wine lovers say, this coffee has ""nose"". I serve this to customers in my salon who adore the aroma and the taste."
5;my dog loves these;My dog loves these jerky treats. My grocery store stopped carrying them.
1;Very disappointing;Had a bottle of this from a health food store, love it, loved the color for a cocktail I was making at the bar I worked at.  When I saw I could get it in quantity here at a slightly cheaper price I jumped at it.
5;Great Stuff!;I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon.
4;Good Value;If you are looking for a replacement for Starbucks Via or other high end instant coffee this comes close.  Not quite as good but still better than regular instant coffee.
5;Mariani Tropical medley;Product arrived within a week.  I had settled for another brand since I couldn't find this one in our local stores.
5;Quick fix;Very good in the morning to pep you up if you don't have time for coffee.  Easy to use and quick to get results.
5;Great grilling rub;My whole family loved this rub. We have used it on steak,chicken,ribs,brisket,in fact everything we have smoked or grilled.
5;Slightly pink in color, but salt non-the-less.;Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff.
5;Favorite Treat;My dogs love this treat and I love the great price. Strips are thicker and more substantial than those on grocery store shelves.
4;Spicy!;The Indian spices make the Tandoor Chef Naan Pizzas especially appealing to me. That their calorie burden is relatively light, and that they are satisfying are an added bonus.
5;Healthy & Tasty...and support charity too!;These are very healthy organic raisins [certified by Oregon's agency], tasty [moistness is fine for me..
5;Why, oh Why, was I buying flavored coffee grounds?;Ladies and Gentleman, I cannot begin to express my joy in finding this Hazlenut Extract.  I'm breathless!<br /><br />I'd been buying flavored coffee grounds and mixing them 1/2 and 1/2 with my espresso beans.
5;dog loves them;My dog loves the taste of these..
2;In The Wilderness;Are we talking about the wild sardines?<br /><br />Uh-uh. We're talking about me, who as of this writing has lapsed into Amazon reviewer oblivion, with a ranking of 1002.
4;"A bit ""Hit or Miss""";I have been chasing that perfect cup for some time now, lately through Amazon by buying and splitting the bags with a neighbor. I use a press, the neighbor goes drip.
5;Best there is;Tasty and fresh - Just like Grandma used to make.  Better than the frozen kind.
5;stevia yay!;I would have given this product a 2 star.  The taste is not that good.
5;The only food I give my cats!;My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats.
5;Good stuff;I like trying new drinks that can be made in the Keurig brewer and this is a good one.I think if you like tea you will like this one.
5;Yum!;My 11 yr. old son has been diagnosed with Celiac this year and loves the flavor of these cookies.
4;Tasty snack;These bars taste quite good, although I agree with other reviewers that there is a strong coconut taste.  Fine with me as I like coconut,  I've ordered three times and the bars have been fresh each time.
5;gluten free and very tasty;I love this soup and it doesn't have any gluten which is a major plus for me. Amazon is the only good outlet I have found for this soup.
4;Good Sweet Jerky;This is jerky in a sweet and soft style.  It's not tough, or very chewy.
5;Easy to brew. Husband loves it.;I got my husband a brew kit from Coopers for his birthday. The Lager is the only beer he's tried to brew, but he says it's very easy and it tastes good.
5;Great invention, tasty, healthy;We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go.
1;Yuck!;I was expecting something amazing by the reviews and I really should have listened to the last review before purchasing, but I decided to give them a chance. They are way too sugary and lack flavor.
1;Nothing but sub-standard tuna from Thailand;Read the labels before you buy. All the flavors of BFF list the following two ingredients at the top of their lists: Tuna & water.
4;Hard to find;I bought this for a Christmas present for our neighbor.  We are unable to get this candy in Texas for some reason.
5;Equal;I have been using this product for years now with great results. It has a great taste and mixes well in cold drinks.
5;My Community Coffee;I lived down in Louisanna for 10 years, and Community Coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee. Here in Iowa I can't buy the Comm.
4;Mrs;The taste was great the cheese was really dry on the outside instead of having a soft removalbe shell.  Overall, it was what I was craving.
5;Fancy Vanilla Tea, sold a fine tea stores.;I love this stuff, hot w/ touch of honey and milk.  Or chilled w/ ice and touch of honey too.
5;Diamond Is Forever!;The veterinarian I worked for recommended Diamond Dog foor to all his breeders to feed to their bitches before and after birth and to their puppies,  I have used it ever since then (18 years).  I bred basset hounds for many years and I fed Diamond puppy food  exclusively and had healthy puppies with beautiful coats and no skin issues.
5;My cats love it;My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.
2;Mystery of ground-shipped ice cream;Wow, am I ever intrigued. Schwan shipped my order from their Minnesota headquarters to Florida by ground UPS, and, among other perishables, was included chocolate almond ice cream and strawberry yoghurt.
5;Tastes so GOOD!!!;First let me start off by saying that I had never eaten Halvah prior to this purchase, and boy do I wonder where I have been all this time! What a great recommendation from a friend of mine.<br /><br />These Halvah snack tastes so good that once you eat one you can't help but want another, do try to contain yourself with this snack.
3;Over roasted...;I am a fan of strong black coffee, but this product tastes almost over roasted to me. Of all the K cups I have tried, this would probably be my least favorite.
5;Great;Not quite the Ford gum from years ago, but very good nonetheless. The tub I received was full and the gum was very fresh (soft).
5;Can't go wrong with Demae Ichou Ramen;You can never go wrong with the Nissin Demae Ichou brand ramen. I lived in Kyushu for many years and this reminded me of Hakata ramen.
4;Nice option, especially when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry;My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.
1;OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD DEAL!;I was VERY disappointed in both the quality and price of this product. The quality was poor, as the candy was stale, and the price was totally ridiculous.
5;Pedigree Puppy Dinner's, Number 1 choice.;Currently we use only Pedigree Puppy dinner's and products, it's my number one choice, the puppies love this product, it provide, excellent nutritional value, and has never been on the list of recalled products to date. Pedigree web site is always happy to send you any information you ask of them concerning a product they sell.
1;VERY DECEIVING!;Ok, I read all the reviews & looking at the picture on the pkg, this sounded like<br />it would be in consistancy like a cracker.  More than one reviewer saying how you<br />could put peanut butter or cheese on it.
1;First time was not a charm.;I did not enjoy this tea & I love tea. This was the first time I had tried a loose leaf tea & I did not like the experience at all.
5;Fantastic Smoky Flavor;Tapatio salsa picante is one of my favorite hot sauces.  The flavor is more smoky and complex than Tabasco and other popular hot sauces.
4;Great moisturizing conditioner;I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair.
4;good when u r allergic to cow milk;i've been using this products for more than a year for my son (5y) and my baby (2y)..
3;Great Product, bad price;I have purchased these 3 or 4 times by now in bulk.  It tastes just like a starbucks cup of coffee, and cost about the same per cup.
5;Excellent food and excellent value;Excellent cat food for mature cats and an excellent value.  For $1 more you get twice as much as buying it at a pet store.
5;Great Taste for a Salad or Snack;Wish-Bone® Salad Spritzers® Ranch Vinaigrette Dressing  is yummy.  This splendid tasting stuff is good on sliced cucumbers, a salad of greens with chicken breast, or on a slice of whole wheat bread.
4;Good for lunch, part 2!;I tried another variety of these Barilla mezze penne dishes, so my observations on the basic product and its packaging are in that other review, with a good impression overall. I found the packaging to be user-friendly and love the fact that these meals have all-natural ingredients.
4;Sodastream;Hi I bought my Sodastream a week and a half ago and to my surprise I'm impressed. I had to mess with the formula a bit but I think I got it right.
5;No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food;Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.
5;always the BEST;MY MOTHER ALWAYS LIKED THE GINGER SNAPS,GINGER ALE, GINGER CANDY,BUT WHEN I BROUGHT HOME THE GINGER SOOTHER AND GINGER ZINGER SHE<br /><br />DOES NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE TO DRINK. SHE'S LIKES THE SMALL BOTTLES AND THE LARGE WITH HER MEALS.
5;If you like Licorice this is great;Tried these on a whim, like them very much and others I have given them to like them also. Received them promptly and will reorder.
2;I don't give a hoot about Van Houtte;I tried several brands and definitely prefer the Green Mountian brand over Van Houtte, Gloria Jeans, or Coffee People.  I suggest someone new to K cups to get the smallest samples of each brand and decide for yourself before buying any in quantity.
5;Delicious;Delicious.  Remove paper before heating & cover with sliced cheddar cheese.
5;Exactly what I was looking for !;I had a peach iced tea at a restaurant I frequent and have been looking for some to brew at our office.  But every one I had bought in the past also had cinnamon and other spices added, which is not what I wanted.
4;Good coffee;This makes a nice cup of coffee that holds up well to cream.  It's dark but not bitter.
4;Natural Hibiscus from The Republic of Tea;My wife decided to try hibisus tea because it was recommended (by Dr. Oz on his show) as a way to lower blood pressure.
4;See's peanut brittle... great taste, questionable advertising;This is by far the best peanut brittle I ever tasted.  I was puzzled by the '1 star' review given earlier.
5;Great ginger flavor;These are the best ginger candies/chews I've ever tried.  The ginger flavor is stronger, and more interesting/complex than that in the more widely-marketed brand, The Ginger People.
5;Awesome;I absolutely love the taste of this jerky. Arrived very quick within 4 days and I received a sample of teriyaki jerky.
5;Pleased;Product was delivered on time. I am well pleased and I would recommedn this shipper.
5;"Love this ""stuff""";The cocoa mix in a CAN is hard to find in a grocery store.  I finally found it on Amazon.
4;Wonderful addition to gift baskets;Great organic hot cocoa, with a very rich taste (especially made with 2% milk!). I used this product in a gift basket I made for a silent auction in support of a children's charity.
5;Love for iced tea (no sweetner needed);I love this for making sweet tea. It is great as a hot tea too! No extra sweetner needed either - it doesn't have any bitter taste to it.
5;Better Than Home Made;These lemon snaps are some of the best cookies I've ever eaten.  They taste better than home-made, with a hint of cracked lemon candy inside each cookie.
5;Yay for coconut oil!;I use this for the bumps on my upper arms.  It helps keep the skin moisturized after exfoliating, apply post-shower.
5;soooooo good!;i love love love this drink mix! i use to live by a coffee shack that use this for their chi tea, but i moved away and none of the coffee shops in my area have a a drink that comes close in flavor (sooooo bland).<br />a to top it off this mix is super easy to make and can be use for more than just hot/cold drinks.
5;Healthy puppy;I got a pekingnese puppy from a friend and we started feeding her science diet puppy food, we started to notice it looked like she was having some type of seizure, here legs would go in different directions and she appeared to be drunk, my husband noticed that she behaved this way after we fed her the puppy food.  I went to the store and found Wellness Puppy food, we gave it to our puppy and she did well with it.
2;i won't buy this again;I just finished the last can in the package of twenty-four, so I think I've given it a fair try. I've also just finished reading the reviews, so I gave it two-stars instead of the one-star I came here to post, but that's as far as I can go.
5;Hawt and Nummy;THe name says it all. I have a lovely bunch of coconuts diddily diddily there they are standing in a row.
5;The only thing I will give my dog;I had a beagle with stomach issues.  I tried the Iams, the Nutro, all of the expensive brands you get at the big name pet stores.
2;Did I get ripped off?;I was supposed to get 2 boxes of Jelly Beans in this package - but only one came.  So I paid $12 for a single little box of Jelly Beans?  Can't get in touch with the shipper to get another.
5;The Best Cheese Spread you'll ever eat!;If you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish, I would give this a try. It was a instant party favorite when I brought this and crackers to friends house.
1;AWFUL flavor, unless you happen to like the flavor of cardboard!;We LOVE freeze dried fruits and vegetables in our house as snacks.  My kids eat freeze dried peas, corn, apples, pears, mango, and pineapple from several other companies, so when these were on sale, I thought I was getting a deal for small lunch box sized snacks.
2;Didn't care of it too much;I think this is one of those types of food products where you will either really like it or not care for it.<br /><br />I am a chocolate fan and I love chocolate and almonds, so I figured this was a natural fit for me.
1;just awful;Love the other flavors..
1;No bueno;Given how much I really enjoy the lite syrup I thought I would go one step further into sugar free land. That was a bad turn.
5;Best tea I ever had;I have tried many varieties of tea throughout my life, many green, black, white and herbal - none quite compare to this. I love green tea, I did not quite understand how making tea into a powder would make it taste much better than loose leaf tea, but it did.
4;Good cup of coffee;You really can't go wrong with Coffee People K-cups. I like their bolder stronger flavors but decided to give this organic one a try this time.
5;So Good;We love this mustard.  We first tried it by buying a jar in Nantucket on vacation.
5;Great olive oil at a great price;This olive oil has a wonderful taste and is a great value.  At first I was a little disappointed because the bottles are plastic, but that probably adds to the savings.
4;Newtons Fruit Thins - Fig;These are good!  They are more like crackers than cookies.  They taste kind of like a cross between Fig Newtons and graham crackers.
5;From the USA not China;As other reviewers have pointed out, these crunch dried apples have their own unique consistency.  I find them to be much more like other freeze dried snacks as opposed to the consistency of a dried apple.
5;Best litter box ever, bought two;It took us one year of searching until we found our favorite litter box.  The sifter and the two bottom boxes makes this box the easiest to sift and dispose of dirty litter and place directly in to clean waiting second box.
5;amazing tea;the huckleberry tea arrived lighting fast. was an absolute treat for my girlfriends visiting mother.
5;Earthy and comforting;Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy.
3;Should be called Whole Pea Soup;Maybe I'm spoiled by all the great split-pea soups I've had over the years, but really ..
4;Make sure you LOVE coconut before you buy;I did see coconut listed in the ingredients, but toward the end of the list.  However, it is heavily laden with coconut.
5;Gluten Free Orgran Macaroni;This is an excellant product. Cooks up very well, great with  any sauces,mac'n cheese, and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad.
5;Delicious;i love the taste of this Pataks Korma Curry cooking sauce. I get 6 jars of the sauce so we will be able to enjoy this meal again and again!<br />The package arrived safely, very well packaged in wrap.
5;Better than Organic;"I tried out different oatmeal as I have started eating healthy for the first time ever.  This oatmeal tastes great straight out of the box whereas other organic oatmeal I get in stores tastes ""dusty"" and craves milk or water."
2;So that's why they call it Holy Basil!;I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.
1;not fresh..;Disappointment..
5;Bacon Spam!;I received my order quickly.  This is the first time I've had this particular flavor and I must say it did NOT disappoint.
5;Fantastic;These taste great, are really healthy and not too expensive as far as real jerky goes. I like to eat them after hard workouts, and I've taken them backpacking and they were always my favorite snack on the trail.
5;Fantastic rice blend;"Basmati rice has to be one of the most delicate forms of this grain on the face of the earth, and Trader Joe's medley of rice and spices has for at least two years served as our family's standard replacement for <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;Fig & Honey?;There is no question about the joy that Nabisco has shown over the years with their delightful Newtons cookies. But with so many people looking for a new way to market the fruit newtons series to dieters, they are trying it with the new fruit thins fig & honey cookies.
2;Don't Buy These;I bought these for my husband. He thought they were plain.
3;They're okay, but nothing special.;Two out of the three cats in my household like these, but I don't feel that they're anything special. If your cat only eats hard cat food, these treats are unnecessary.
5;Addicted to Kind bars;I confess I am addicted to most of the Kind Bars.  My first try of the Blueberry Pistachio bars sealed my problem  They are delicious, fairly low in calories and I sometimes use them as a meal substitue and feel satisfied.
5;Great Toy... Keeps your pet busy for a long time...;I recently adopted a Boston Terrier. I've always had large breed dogs, so I did a lot of research before selecting him.
5;Such a cute gift!;The gift set was a really cute gift for that special someone. My favorite part was the packaging: a cute brown box (looked kind of like a book) with a nice white bow that had some elastic in it.
3;Unfortunately I'm Allergic;"These are the second distinctly nut-flavored meal or snack bars I've ever tried, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;Bites hard for stomach upset;I bought this item for stomach upset and it is has a very pepper bite for stomach  upset.  I would not recommend it for that.
5;Kind Plus, Cranberry & Almond;Excellent bar, very tastey.  It is a bit messy to eat because of the honey so I would not recommend carrying it with you.
5;Best all-around bean;This is an exceptional bean for any coffee drinker. It is easily the best price fair trade and organic option on the market, unless you want something flavorless.
5;MRP;If your in athletic mode,great product for replacement of nutrition,especially after tough workouts. Completely balanced meal with high quality protein.
4;Another good drink from Nescafe!;This one is a good drink, but, for a warm espresso + milk beverage, I still prefer the Latte Macchiato, which is very slightly sweeter. It would also be nice if this cappuccino developed a little more foam.
3;So So;I have to agree with the recent reviews, these are just so so as far as taste.  I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love.
4;Just got my Beaba!;I have read through the entire instructions for the Beaba. It is very basic and lends to common sense.
5;Tasty little morsels;A coworker had these one day in the office and she let me try them. I was hooked.
5;Good bones at a good price;You get LOTS of bones at a very good price. You can't beat this at the supermarket or a pet store.
5;pure awesomeness;Best gluten-free bread by far. We make ours in the bread machine and little over 2 hours and delicious fresh bread.
5;Great mints and profits go to charity;Paul Newman was great in establishing a company that has great food products. Even better, the profits go to charity.
4;Popcorn;Jolly Time Healthy Pop is a tasty low-calorie kettle corn.  My husband and I like it a lot.
4;Pretty!;I love my little bonsai!  My only complaint would be that it hasn't yet flowered, and I've had it for 6 months.  Oh, and it ships in an unusual way - wrapped in bubble wrap and in a box with packing peanuts.
2;Really;Received cappuccino K cups from Grove Square, they were in a mailer box not even in the original box , I was unable to see nutrional value of any of the three types of coffee , it is super sweet, I am very disappointed and am stuck with $45.00 of K-cups.
3;Yum;These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.
5;The best coffee ever;I can only buy this in a small 12 ounce container at my local stores and it costs $8.00.
4;Good Low Carb Bread;This is at least truly low carb, unlike Julian bread. While it is a bit dry, it makes good toast or grilled sandwiches.
4;Pamela's Chunky Chocolate Chip Cookies;These cookies are very rich, and at something like 120 calories for one cookie, that is probably a good thing - you won't overeat.  I like them, though, and they are the closest glutenfree chocolate chip cookie I have been able to find.
5;Hemp Protein;Love this product!!  I use it in fruit smoothies for breakfast & lunch.  Gives me the protein boost I need.
5;An awe-inspiringly delicious snack;It takes a great deal of self-control not to slam down 3 or 4 of these after every hard workout. Ingredient list is not frightening, serving size is perfect, fulfills good refueling proportions, depending on your own protocols.
5;It is an amazing meal;Pros - Good clean energy that does not make me instantly sleepy or wear out after an hour.<br /><br />Cons - The biggest hurdle with this stuff is getting it blended into anything.
3;Good but not as good as Full City;This is a good coffee from Tully's, but it is not as bright as Full City.  Seems to be a little strong without the flavor you hope from a stronger coffee.
5;Heady Aroma and Delicious Peach Flavor;Before you even take a sip of this tea the peach aroma entices you. Unlike most green teas this tea is not overly bitter.
5;Fine Home Made Flavor;This is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing.
5;Great, sugar free cherry soda;It took me a long time to find Cherry Crush through a web retailer, and I was in heaven. However, for health reasons, I had to make the switch from sugar to diet drinks.
5;Best thing ever;WARNING: Highly addictive!  :)  A little pricey, but worth it. The flavors are intense and perfect for parties, brunch or snacks.
4;I wanted to love this product, but my house is not warm enough;I love the taste of coconut, and I know there are just so many health benefits to it as well.  So I wanted to love this.
4;Love the flour, hate the shipping costs;I still remember the first time I made GF chocolate chip cookies from this flour..
5;fantastic product;My geriatric Bouvier Des Flandres is 12 years old and becoming increasingly finicky with his eating.  This product not only is palatable but has encouraged him to eat, again.
5;Holy cow;I expected a good few pounds of gummi bears. But you just don't understand how many come with this little package.
1;Bad batch??;We just bought 3 cans for $3.00 each at JobLot.
4;Interesting product, clever delivery;Good taste, easy to carry and the spray concept is a wonderful way to ingest it.  The maple flavor tones down the intensity of the bitterness.
5;Great coffee;I just love Coffee Bean direct.  They have some very fresh coffee and its such an amazing deal.
5;best seltzer around;If you are looking for a clean, tasty, non-chemical or additive seltzer, Boylan's is the absolute way to go. Fresh, clean and fizzy in a stylish glass (no plastic please) bottle.
4;How to use this.. if you are white!;"Think of this like lip balm for hair. I use <a href=""http://www."
1;19g of sugar in 100g portion;19g is about 4 tsp of sugar.<br />Just do simple calculations: would you put 4 tsp of sugar in your cup of coffee? We're talking about 4 tsp for 240 ml.
5;Finely ground and rich in flavor;I am a coffee fiend and this was surprisingly good for the price.  I accidently bought the ground instead of the bean but it was very fresh and more of an espresso grind.
4;Great! My favorite flavor!;These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time.
5;Great product;I'm not sure what the other reviewers expected when they ordered an unsweeted bottle of tea, but the taste is exactly what you'd get if you brewed a cup of tea at home. Use a bit of sweetener (sugar or substitute) if you don't care for unsweetened tea, but don't bash the product because it doesn't taste like Pepsi!<br /><br />Anteadote is a very convenient way to get tea into my daily routine.
4;Woof!;My dogs love these treats!! Would have given 5 stars but they are very small. My 80 and 100 pound Labradors wolf these.
1;Was Great Until They Changed It;I have been drinking Twist Waters for over a year, buying them both at my local grocery and online to keep my supply steady. What a shock when the new bottles arrived with a new formula that made them virtually undrinkable.
5;Chai Tea;I love Chai Tea Lattes from Starbucks and tried many kinds of Chai Tea bags at home.  Stash comes the closest.
4;Yummy!;I'm really enjoying these salts.  Each kind comes in a small bag that's resealable (at least until the glue dries out), though if you don't close them just right you won't be able to close the lid again.
2;Stash fails splendidly this time.;The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all.
5;A great substitute for sugar.;Because of health problems, I've had to give up sugar.  The agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute.
4;Best Coconut Milk - But Buy It Locally;This is the best brand of coconut milk/cream I have found.  I am still exploring other brands, but this is better than Thai Kitchen, Roland, etc.
5;Absolutely the best1;These hand-made candies are sure to please.<br />As a native I have known them all my life.
2;Not my favorite;I generally love Haribo products. Not this one.
3;Seems okay;Not quite the same as I used to get in Costco, but closs enough. Only con, too many undissolved particles.
2;So disappointed!;"After reading so many glowing reviews, I was expecting a really special taste experience. It just goes to show how different people's tastes are, b/c I found it to be weak and hardly tasty at all! I brewed it on the ""small cup"" setting to get the strongest brew (b/c I know Gloria Jean's flavors tend to be on the weaker side) and still found it to be nearly tasteless."
5;What a difference a little bit of nice salt makes!;We used this salt in the Sydney Seafood School cooking classes when we attended last month and I fell in love.  It's lovely and coarse.
5;Takes very good!;I really like the Byron Bay brand.  These are great cookies and showed up in good shape (my second order of the Byron Bay Lemon Macadamia cookies showed up in PURE crumbs.
5;Good Cookies;This sandwich cookie is crisp, not too sweet and delicious with a cup of coffee or tea.  Really satisfies the craving for something to dip into your coffee.
5;Best Sunflower Seeds bar none;I have tried all of the others (David & Sons and others) but none compare to the Sunflower seeds by Jim Beam.  They have a flavor that I just can't eat a few but sometimes I have gone through the whole bag in one sitting.
5;delicious;This brand is so sweet. i love it.
5;This is my lifetime favorite salad dressing.;I have been using this salad dressing for years.  I make a green salad with red leaf lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, bean sprouts, carrots, cheese and garlic croutons, and this dressing.
5;AWESOME!!!!;I have ordered and used Suchard's Chocolate for several years..
4;Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem;My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.
5;Great Lollipops;I bought these for my 2 nieces - one is 3 the other is 6. They love lollipops.
5;Best Store-Bought Cookie Available;If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer.
3;Pretty good, but;Rather messy this time. The packets seemed difficult to use for some reason.
4;Average Chip, Good Ingredients.;Not too bad. It is similar to the stone ground or multigrain chips out there.
5;My favorite Jelly Belly flavor;I have been a huge fan of Jelly Bellys since I was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  I have always had a favorite.
2;False advertising:  Picture of product does not match item that arrived;I'm annoyed that through negligence or incompetence there is a picture online of the product for sale (a box of cookies and a jar of something that looks like lemon curd or preserves), which does not match the item that arrived.  The cookies were to be a gift for a French friend from Aix.
2;way too sour, too!;I just tried Patak's Madras Curry Paste, and am surprised (but not too surprised) that another reviewer also found Patak's Tikka Masala paste too sour.  I have found two other reviewers that also found Patak's Madras Curry Paste too sour, so perhaps that's a Patak quirk.
5;First Mate is the first food to do it right!;As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America.
3;Mmmmmm........mmmmm;I decided to try these since I remember eating them as a kid (decades ago) and they are still quite tasty. Mallomars are a combination of crisp cookie bottom with marshmallow on top covered by a chocolate coating.
4;Robust Coffee;While I am not a coffee snob, I do enjoy a rich, robust cup of coffee in the morning.  I had previously tried several different brands of coffee for my new one-cup coffee maker and been disappointed.
5;angel hair is best;"Stick with the angel hair.  They ""chew"" much better."
2;Not worth the hype;I have been contemplating getting this for about a year but because it was a limted offer coffee it was way too expensive.  I almost broke because I heard all the great reviews.
5;Yummy Treats......;I use these treats as a tool to train my Golden. She LOVES these treats, and responds to them with great vigor.
5;My new addiction;Wow, I never thought I'd love shortbread cookies and jam so much! These cookies are amazingly good, and even better - I'm usually satisfied after just one, so no worries about sitting and eating a whole package at once. Great to go with a hot beverage, or as a small dessert.
4;Baked apple offers more fiber, less sugar;Through the work week, breakfast is perfunctory with oatmeal just another option among cereal bars and yogurt. We've stocked various brands of instant oatmeal but Quaker Oatmeal Express best balances our desires for tasty and healthy.
5;excellent cracker;second time ordering this cracker online for for my son. he loves wheat thins! a bad review was recently written by mistake, problems with my computer.
5;no chemical aftertaste;This is the best powdered sugar ever..
2;I wouldn't buy it for the taste! Too Sour and causes discomfort!;I received the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate and decided to try it one afternoon. My first impression was it smelled like jello.
4;K-Cups Coffee;This is a delicious, slightly sweet coffee with a hint of cinnamon.  The shipping time was excellent.
5;Great Dog Food;Switched to this after two years of Science Diet. I couldn't believe that SD has by-products, so I switched and my dog loves this.
5;French Vanilla Cappuccino;Great price.  Really love the the flavor.
5;Excellent;No gluten, no soy, no tree nuts, no peanuts!  Smooth consistency and mellow taste, I would recommend this to others with multiple food allergies/intolerance's..
5;Wow!;I'm very surprised how GOOD this soup is. I'm pretty picky with canned soups, no msg, etc.
2;Corp rip off;This item is very Healthy for US.Problem here is fair price this sells for around 78 cents LB about $4.
5;mmmmgood;I love these chips .whenever I need a snack , this is it and only 100 calories.
4;Not bad;I bought 3 different flavors as I'm gluten free and they seemed safe. The PB & J was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good.
3;Hit or miss;These taste good, but the quality of the nuts used is inconsistent. Sometimes the nuts are painfully hard and brownish, looking like an almond you found in the couch cushion years after someone dropped it in there.
5;This stuff is amazing;I have made Vegan Burger with this and even some meat eaters loved them.  This is great for vegan Chili also.
5;Oh, Snickers...;..
2;A Loyal Wolfgang Puck Customer;love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware,brand endorsed products, all his brand products / cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it brews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand, products.
5;Love this tea;This tea has such a unique sweet/spicy flavor. I love it.
5;Very good quality;This is a wonderful flavored coffee without the fake chemical taste and smell. We like to drink it any time of the year and look forward to trying more coffee from this company as well.
3;Reuse k-kaps;I received a keurig Coffee maker for Christmas and enjoy the ability to have fresh brewed coffee with little or no waste. However.
1;Yuck.;These neither look nor taste like pretzels. I can appreciate the effort to put GF snack foods out there, but at this exorbitant price and tremendous fail on execution.
4;Mother's Day Gift;The product presentation and shipping packaging were outstanding.  The product itself was of great quality and was a very good Mother's Day present.
4;Picky cat not quite so picky now;Finally a wet food that my cat is willing to eat when he feels like it.  No fault of the product.
5;Dr. Krackers' Best Product;The Pumpkin Seed Cheddar Crackers are the best product we have purchased.  For the taste, wonderful fiber source, and overall great product, you will not find one better.
5;Watermelon jello fan;I have always loved watermelon flavored products. When watermelon jello became available a few years ago, I was estatic.
5;Downright Addictive!;These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.
5;YUM;"I got these specifically to put in my daughter's lunch box as a treat. She loves Nutella and says that these are ""delicious!"" They are pretty pricey, so I let her know that they would be a once in a while treat only."
5;Just like being in Venice!;I was recently in Venice with my husband and friends and we went to Harry's Bar at Saint Mark's Square.  This is the bar where Bellini's were invented so we had to try them.
1;Vomiting Kitty;"Like many others on here, my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these ""tasty"" treats. She really loves them, however they don't love her back."
4;Crunchy;These bars are good. Always nice to have few in the car.
5;Excellent Quality - last a long, long, long, long time.;"Purchased two of these from seller ""Penguin Mints"" (fulfilled by Amazon) and they arrived in fresh condition.  These are better than having 12 regular sized pops (approx an equivalent total weight) because they are so thick it takes literally an hour to get a piece soft enough to chew it off!  Great for satisfying a sweet tooth with actually very little sugar (per hour of enjoyment that is)."
5;Helps keep your cat healthy;This is an excellent food for your cat since meat is the first ingredient, the cheaper brands of dry cat food all contain huge amounts of carbs, though they are not listed as such among the proteins and vitamin statistics. Basic science lesson: carbs are converted to sugar by the digestive process, the more carbs the more sugar and the higher risk of your cat contracting diabetes.
3;Not very sparkly;These sparkles made my cake look great, but were not what I was expecting. The picture led me to believe that they were sparkly but they really just looked like black opaque crystals.
5;Great deal on a great tea;I've been drinking white tea daily for years-- and this is my favorite. The Amazon price is significantly lower than I can find at the store, even on sale.
5;soo yummy!;I love these bars although the sesame is one of my least favorite flavors but the dark chocolate with nuts or peanut butter and the fruit nut or coconut are wonderful flavors and i think they make for a perfect healthy snack. If i want something sweet i will grab one of these and im satisfied.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
2;Not Flour... just ground coconut;"I had been using Bob's Red Mill coconut flour for all my gluten-free baking but decided to try this brand because it was cheaper. And, let's just say you get what you pay for!! This coconut ""flour"" isn't flour at all."
5;Cute!;Perfect for a small gift topper or as a part of a gift bag or set! Just the perfect amount to make them enjoyable but not too much to feel like it's a waste if a flavor was..
1;"NOT ""Virtually Indestructible""";We gave these to our labs on Christmas morning.  Within half an hour, one of the balls was falling apart - the dogs were able to bite chunks of the blue material off.
3;Good, but...;My dog loves this stuff..
5;Excellent to have around ...;It mixes easily with water or milk.  No blender required, though blending does make it frothy.
5;My dog loves it;Nina is in love with the Chicken breasts.  Every time she gets one, she jumps into her bed to savor it.
5;Way better than Pop-Tarts;"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot."
5;I really like it!;Well I guess it's just a matter of taste, because I really like it.<br />I use the largest cup setting and add mini marshmallows, delish!<br />This is my 3 box now.
1;Gross;I got Teryaki flavored of the mega packs and yuck! The jerky was so hard and crunchy and old..
1;"""Health"" Does Not Always Equal Health";It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong.
3;Tasty in oatmeal;I have only tried one bag of these organic prunes.<br /><br />They taste best to me in home-cooked oatmeal.
4;Taste Comparison with Senseo;I still have about 8 pods of Senseo Columbian left. Not sure why Columbian packaging since it was the last one left in my Sumatran batch.
5;Same quality at a cheaper price!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Cincinnati chili;Being a native born Cincinnatian, I grew up on Cincinnati style chili,I had been craving some for quite some time.This is as close to being the real thing than anything I have ever tried.
5;Best ... chips ... ever;Hands down, there isn't a tortilla chip that I crave more.  Exactly enough heat to be interesting, but not overwhelming.
5;Hemp seeds;Really like the hemp seeds from Manitoba.  I got them last year too so this is a repeat order.
1;Pricing;I was shocked to see that these are selling for over $15 on Amazon.  My local grocery store carries this exact same product for $8.
5;Excellent Coffee;Makes a great cup of coffee. Rich and mild.
4;Lipton Iced Tea 74-Ounce Size;This is the same tea I've been getting through Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program for some 4 or 5 years now -- only now I'm getting the 74-ounce size,as this is cheaper than the smaller 25-ounce size.I would have been getting this larger size earlier,but at the time,Amazon only carried the 25-ounce size.
5;Senseo Breakfast Blend;The coffee was very, very good.  It was quite tasty, in fact I think I like it even better than any of their other blends.
5;Good dog food, good ingredients;This is very good dog food and has excellent ingredients.  All natural and no corn.
5;super breakfast treat...;"Toast 1/2 English muffin, smear with bacon jam <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Wrong bag pictured;Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula.
5;Double Salt Licorice;Excellent product. I bought this for my boyfriend who is Dutch and loves this kind of candy.
5;Cats Love These!!;My two Scottish Folds, who don't really like toys, loved these from the moment I opened the package.  After they've (the toys) have been lying around a while I just rub them between my two hands and they are back to their original state and the cats love them again.
2;Not what I thought;"I was looking to buy ""Chicklet"" gum and this is actually ""Double Bubble"" brand gum. Gum is a lot harder to chew, which was no good for me since I have to chew ""Chicklet"" brand gum."
5;SUMI LOVES IT AND IT'S GOOD FOR HER!;After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food
4;Great taste, packing is a joke;The chocolate is great, smooth, almost too smooth because it melts too fast and i dont get to enjoy it for too long. They contacted me warning that it would melt in the heat where i live but i said send it anyway.
2;Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me;I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box.
1;Bad taste;This product is sweetened with Splenda, and tastes very artificial. Maybe if you like diet soda you will like this, but the 3 people that sampled it did not.
5;dog treats;These are wonderful.  Good ingredients- our girl loves them and they  work well for training and rewards.
1;Terrible Customer Service from Euro Food Mart;I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted.
1;Misleading nutrition information;I almost stopped giving my son iron drops thinking that this product was giving him much of his daily iron needs. The sweet potato/pumpkin flavor says it contains 45% of the daily iron needs but really it only has 2%.
5;This thing is the greatest;I made my 1st child's food using a pot of boiling water and steam basket, then transferring it to a bowl and using a kitchen aid hand blender. It was such a chore and so much clean up.
1;Very  old stock;I received this product from Amazon who sent me the oldest stock possible. The postage alone cost about $60 and i ordered about $60 worth of the product.
5;Cat begs to clean teeth!;My geriatric cat loves these treats. He begs every time I sit down at my desk (treats are stored in a drawer).
4;Tr-Berry, very tastey;Bought a box of this and it's certainly cheaper than buying the single packs at your local sports shop.  TriBery is a great taste as the taste is barely there, which is nice when you're doing long runs and need to eat 6 or 7 of them.
5;DeCecco Spaghetti;DeCecco is the worlds best spaghetti.  Their semolina and special dies provide a unique surface that coat it in a superb way, and the aroma while cooking is extraordinary.
5;Wonderful bold taste;Wonderful bold taste, very smooth, with a robust flavor.  If you don't prefer a rich coffee flavor, this isn't the coffee for you.
5;Red Raspberry Leaf Tea;I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health.
3;Sorry, Not For My Cup Of Tea;I am used to artificial sweeteners, although I have and do use regular sugar. That makes it surprising that this sweetener struck out so badly with me.
5;Pickwick Peppermint Herbal Tea;I first tried the Pickwick Peppermint Herbal Tea in a restaurant & was hooked. The Peppermint flavor of the Pickwick brand tea is so wonderful! I couldn't find it in local stores so I searched the internet & found the best price combo for the tea & shipping through Amazon.
5;Annies Bunny Grahams Review;I made Easter baskets for the grandchildren this year, and, put a box of these in it.  Also, put a couple other boxes of Annie's products in their baskets.
4;Yummmmmmm;I bought this at my local grocery store to use in my new Mr. Coffee espresso machine.
4;hard to find item here, APO;Can`t find this item here for the military in Germany. Graet to have some of that home taste over here.
5;Don't Buy This Please;This is just about the only thing our cat will eat on a regular basis so please make sure you always leave some on the shelf for her!!!  Only problem with this product is that our local stores seem to only carry the other flavors.  She will not eat them.
5;Best Ever;Maddy's Key Lime Cookies are like the ones your grandma used to make, when everyone used real butter and really staked their reputation on the cookies they could bring to a gathering.  To taste one of these melt-in-your-mouth cookies is to travel back in time.
5;Best Price Available;Love this tea but it's hard to find at a reasonable price. It's always in stock and gets here in a few days.
4;For ginger fans;This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia.
5;Super Fast Shipping- AMAZING FLAVOR!;Avid coffee lover & have never found a flavor I love as much as this! Wonderful, perfect, marvelous, A+!<br />Ordered Friday night- recieved Monday afternoon. Couldn't ask for a better purchase.
1;ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! STAY FAR AWAY;Thanks to this horrible deodorant, I have damaged over 20 shirts of mine. This deodorant works great and does the job, however you soon realise that all your shirts are becoming damaged.
5;Hard to find Candy;The candy itself was good and fresh..
5;Joanne Nichols;How can you rate this a 2? It`s better than Paul Newmans and the decaf. process is done right.
5;Very good for boxed pasta!;I'm glad I ordered this.  It cooks easily and fairly quick - just boil some water and put in the pasta, let it cook about 10 minutes and it's ready to eat!  If you like puffier pasta, you can just put this pasta in a small pan of boiling water and then turn the heat off.
1;Rip Off;"I bought four of the ""Best Sellers Collection"" Gift Boxes as Christmas gifts for clients.  What a joke."
5;great product;I bought this product to add to my Isopure shakes for weight loss.<br /> I wanted to lose weight but also improve my overall health which<br />meant antioxidants.
5;Fabulous!;These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals.
5;Give me Jet Fuel;Awesome coffee!!!!.I'm a serious coffee drinker of 40+ years and this is perfect.
5;Very tasty;I took a few sips of this stuff, and couldn't help but wonder what all the 5* reviews were for. To me, the taste kind of reminds me of those chocolatey breakfast shakes.
5;Nice;If you like salt water taffy and you like black liquorice you will love this stuff I sure do..
5;It really did help;It really did help my father is a cancer patient and. Didnt want to eat because the taste was no good.
5;Wonderful treat!;"This ""choffee"" really tastes great and is low in calories.  I drink it just hot from a coffee press cup and finds it satisfies my desire for chocolate."
1;Tastes of Death (Peppered);I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.
3;OK- but no real energy burst;After reading the other reviews, I was thinking I'd better be careful lest I end up beet red and running around my office like a rat on acid.  Well no problems there.
3;it's really dark water;I picked up a bottle from wegman's about a week ago after months of wondering. It really freaked me out because actually the bottle was clear and the water is just pitch black.
4;Some words of warning;Ballerina are definitely my favourite cookies. I agree with the other reviewer.
5;New favorite!;This one will not disappoint!  I got this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it.  I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.
2;Twist Essence Water West Indies Lime;I recently found this product at my local grocery store.  And I picked up a few flavors to try.
5;Stevia Extract;"I have used the ""Now""brand stevia for several years now but this improved version is just as good and it dissolves in liquids much easier than the old product. I use this as a sweetner in any drink that needs sugar."
5;Love this product!!;Love this product!! Glad to find it in a smaller bottle. Love agave, would never go back to white sugar!! Product arrived promptly, great service.
5;Great stuff;This is a great deal. If you buy the non-organic version in most stores you'll easily pay 3x as much.
5;Green leafy house plant;I ordered an Aglaia Odorata Chinese Perfume Rice Plant Bonsai from 9GreenBox on September 27, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on October 1, 2012.  It arrived in good shape, wrapped in plastic.
1;NOT Unscented!;"This product says ""unscented"" all over it, but has a STRONG perfume smell - fragrance is listed as an ingredient. If you call, they will tell you that it is a ""masking scent"" - yes, I call that scented."
5;Love this;My daughter loves this. This goes very well with bread, crepe or any sort of breakfast items.
3;eat-a-rope;My 10-month pitbull loves this, but she chewed through the rope on this toy within her third day of having it.  That's a pretty short life for $14 so for those of you who have had the same thing happened here's what I did: forget the rope and put a tennis ball or two inside with kibble.
5;Super Yummy!!;This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried..
5;Everytime, silence at my dinner table, even my classy lady wears it as she eats!;I have been the one selecting bbq sauce when shopping since I was 12 and I have been a fan of few. Tony Roma's Bold and Spicy is hands down my absolute favorite! The very first time I chose it I warned my girlfriend of how spicy it is as she sat down to eat dinner, I tasted it before applying.
3;Not as good as I initially thought;Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough.
5;Senseo Roast Coffees;Amazon allows me to enjoy my Senseo coffeemaker thoroughly..
5;The Real Thing;These awesome chips get their flavor from actual jalapeno bits and crushed red peppers.  There is a world of difference between this product and Dorito-type chips that have flavor merely sticking to the surface.
5;satisfying;These bars are the most satisfying I have ever eaten.  I carry them in my car and they satisfy my hunger.
4;Very Good Cat Food but...;My Cat Loved it so I did give it 4 stars for quality and taste.<br />My one problem with it, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that Petite Cuisine is made in Thailand.
1;Moldy!;Just letting ya know that I bought a pack of these before..
5;Love this stuff!!!;I love sobe lifewater. I have alot of trouble with 0 calorie drinks normally, because alot of the artifical sweeteners make me sick.
5;Fine Food for Diverse Cats;I have two special needs cats.  One is very small and could stand to gain weight.
4;Milk;I bought the dry milk so that I could have milk in my morning tea. It is very good.
5;Calico Love...;My Calico girls just love this.  I've been searching for a way to get them off dry food.
5;Deployed Soldiers Love it!;My boyfriend serving in the military asks for nothing but these instant coffee packets. They are the perfect gift to send over to our soldiers serving overseas to keep them alert and ready.
5;Excellent coffee;As a lover of flavored coffees this is one of my favorites. Not too strong or too weak.
5;Fastest way to great beef curry;I love curries and I was anxious to try the Rendang Curry that promoted itself as quick and easy. When I read through the instructions, I was somewhat surprised that the type of beef called for in this recipe was 28oz of pricey beef tenderloin (think filet mignon).
1;Poorest steaks ever;Just call me a sucker!!!  Ordered a bunch of steaks, burgers, hot dogs, potatoes, and fish from Omaha Steaks.  Poorest meat I have ever eaten.
5;Classic in every sense of the word;"Ahhhh, ""Always Coca-cola!!"" Yes, my friends Coke is probably the most popular soda in the world.  You can go anywhere on earth and be able to purchase it, even places like Turkey!  To those places it's like a symbol of capitalism coming in and much more commercialism."
5;BEST ESPRESSO IN THE WORLD;The best espresso money can buy. I use to like SegaFredo brand, but La Vazza crema e gusto is way ahead.
5;Great Coffee, Great Prices, and Great Service!;I have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results.  U-Roast-Em is the exception.
1;Over-fried;I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural.
4;"It works, though not quite ""comfortable""";"I started a new high protein diet and have been less regular than usual, and was getting bloated from all the waste building up. I decided to try this as a ""natural"" way to deal with this issue."
5;Applejacks;I was really impressed with the fast service. The cereal was in great condition and the price was better than the sales prices in the store.
5;Really Good Juice!;I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon.
5;Great price;My boyfriend was always talking about some 12lb gummy rat he got for a graduation gift, I was looking around online for something similar to send to my brother for his 16th birthday (a tradition now to send gummies). I found the website selling the 'original' world's largest gummy bear, and was ready to buy it until I figured I'd check amazon just in case, saved myself over $10 including shipping!<br />My family got it well on time, and even though they live in Texas, had no issues with smush face like some other customers have.
5;Fabulous Pop Chips;This manufacturer is wonderful and follows up with their clients.  It is really appreciated.
5;My son loves these;My son absolutely loves these buns.  He asks for tham all the time.
5;good basic coffee;a good brew, not starbucks, but not store brand.  Decent coffee w/ over 100 yrs of history.
5;Excellent smooth, light coffee.  Good anytime.;Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.
5;Not as I thought, but still great;Ever since I have seen these here on Amazon I have always wanted to try them. It took a while, but I bought some.
5;Highest antioxidant...;I keep the big bag in the refrigerator inside another zip lock bag even though I consume this frequently and need to purchase another bag every month. Excellent tasting.
1;Product is great but the seller stinks;The food deserves 5 stars, but the seller (1800PetMeds) deserves zero stars, if that could be assigned. My dog has allergies, but does well on this brand of non-grain dog food.
2;Taco seasoning;This taco seasoning was not good.  We used it once and threw the remainder away.
3;Not good shipped?;I bought one of these at a store and thought I would order a box of the Peanut Butter-Dark Chocolate Protein online. I am not sure if it is the heat of the summer or off batches but the last two 12 packs I have ordered have been in date but as hard as rock.
3;I've used these and every other kind...;And they are ONLY as good as the season you're trying to use them in. If you do your research about the feeding habits of wasps/hornets and stinging things, you will see that they are attracted to sugary things early in the year, and you should set this kind of trap out early.
4;Healthy Alternative to Potato Chips;If you want a low-fat and low calorie natural snack, these veggie stix are tasty and have 55% lower fat than potato chips.  They are fun to munch on.
5;addictive;These cookies are wonderful!  I couldn't stop eating them.  I can not find them locally.
3;cat litter mat;Finally found this item and was very excited to buy because of its low price and because I have messy kitties. Was happy about the fast shipping but was not happy that I recieved a blue mat when I wanted the silver one pictured.
1;I don't know how they managed to ruin this product.;The old Zico was delightful.  This new version is so aweful as to be totally undrinkable.
1;Way too sweet!;I posted a review for the Spiced Apple Cider by this company complaining about how sweet it was, but that was mild compared to this one.  Far too sweet.
5;Dog loves them;My dog loves these rawhide chips and they keep her occupied for quite a while.  I like that they aren't all the exact same size and thickness so I can decide which one I want to give my dog.
5;GREAT TASTE.;I bought these for myself because of being on weight watchers and sometimes I want that salty snack.  My husband and friends who are not watching their weight also loved them.
4;Wonderful for a present - or for yourself;We like the small 17,6 oz size available of the La Florentine Panettone. It's ideal for little presents.
1;They didn't respond to my complaints;I bought little bags of  Charms cotton candy that took them a month to get it to me and then they were stale and crumbly.Throughout it all,they had nothing to say.
2;The same as any other dark roast k-cup;I drink a lot of k-cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors. I would compare the Kona k-cups to just about any other k-cup that's medium or dark roast.
5;Hard to find, worth the price;None of the large grocery chains in CA carry Wheatena any more. The small chain at which I used to buy it no longer carries it.
5;Great meat substitute!;My husband and I love this product.  I have used it in many recipes calling for chicken.
5;Great rice for sushi;Pretty clean rice, doesn't need much washing as compared to the cheap stuff I got at an asian market down the street.  Cooks up nice, tastes good.
3;I wish it were more chocolaty;Zero calories and easily dispensed chocolate flavoring/sweetening for coffee drinks. This is a lot to like, but when people have to ask what flavor is that, then it is a signal that the chocolate is insufficiently chocolaty.
1;Please avoid!!;Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.
5;My Yorkies Love it !;I have 3 Yorkies , from 17lbs to 4lbs and my 4lb never gain any weight, we had them on the food from our Vet, I tried this dog food , they love it, and it looks like little one is gaining a little weight. We have been on this food for about 3 weeks now.
1;Plastic smell and taste;I love mango and peach so I was excited to try this tea.  When I first opened it and sniffed it smelled vaguely fruity but there was also an almost overwhelming plastic smell.
5;Excellent Low Sugar Cereal;It is very difficult to find granola with low sugar, let alone
4;"(Our parrot says,) ""Yummy!""";We ordered these for our parrot, and he's very happy with them. Normally we pick up almonds at Samsclub, but haven't been lately.
4;Great Sauce!!!;A really great Sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. It is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods! It is also a great sauce to make Chili Thai sushi roll.
4;Mmm Good - a review of Mi-Del's Ginger Snaps;I am the sort of mom who likes to bake my own cookies because 1) it's fun, and 2) I like to know what goes into them.  However, when that is not practical I buy these ginger snap cookies.
5;Favorite thing about Brazil;I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil.
4;Yummy;"""I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.""<br /><br />The song is correct."
5;Just like home made;Better than any other marinara sauce in the stores. Made by hand in the Berkshires, and before now, available in Whole Foods, Dean and DeLucca, and small stores selling top notch food products.
4;Coffee pods;This was a fantastic find the stores in my area don't Cary these anymore. Price was a bit high.
5;Wonderful;Being a native Michiganer I have a love for all things Michigan. I was a bit concerned in purchasing these dried Cherries thinking they wouldn't be as fresh as what I can get in state.
5;Stash has always delivered in quality tea.;We have purchased several different black teas from Stash and have yet to be dissapointed in their products.  Several of their black teas are such favorites with our family and friends that we placed them on an automatic reorder.
4;Price could be better;All in all it was great the price however could be a lot cheaper its just 12 noodles..
4;German Spice;I grew up with this spice and missed it. I enjoy ist everytime.
5;Dinner in 20 minutes;I saw this product today at the store. I'm a good cook, for sure,  but there are days I want to get dinner ready in thirty minutes tops.
5;Lamb and beef stew;My 4 yr old poodle loves this mixture. The combination of chunks and gravy are very exciting to him.
5;Delicious;For some reason I can not find raspberry jam where I live in AR.  This jam is wonderful, nice and thick and just sweet enough.
4;Nescafe Clasico is pretty good;I disagree with the two previous reviewers. If brewed coffee is not available, Nescafe Clasico is my choice.
4;Flying High!;"I just recieved my Jet Fuel this morning and here are my first impressions after just a couple of cups:<br />Flavor is smooth, not bitter (maybe just a hint of aftertaste), deep and satisfying. That being said, I'll probably go back to my Keurig ""Green Mountain"" coffee next time anyway."
3;USA made!;These Barksters by Loving Pet are the the only product on their line that is made in the USA. My dogs loved the Loving Pet Sticks but when I read they were made in China, I threw them away and refuse to buy Loving Pet's many other products until they are made in the US.
4;Excellent flavor works to curb afternoon hunger;I had this perception that a protein drink would be gritty or thick.<br /><br />This product dissolves fully and has no thickness.
5;My Shih Tzu;My Coco only eats this food.  Believe me when I say he is a very fussy eater.
5;Nut Milk Bag;I have used it 3 times and each time has been a success.  The material is very light but seems to be sturdy for its use.
5;The only treats she will eat;I have tried and tried to feed my cat fancier cat treats (Real Meat, fish flakes, etc) but she isn't having it. Despite eating superfancy Fromm Four Star cat food in exotic flavors like Duck and Surf  Turf, you would think shewas starving from the way she comes sprinting the moment I shake the Friskies treat bag.
5;Best coffee available;Tully's Breakfast Brew in my opinion is the best coffee available for the price.  I drink two to three cups every morning, and it is a great way to start the day.
1;break easily- would NOT recommend;I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby.
5;A Macrobiotic Kid's Dream;I grew up on these franks.  They taste nothing like real hot dogs and have a truly unique texture.
4;screwing your customer;A good product that sells for 12.95 every place else,and you sold it for that.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;White wheat flour--who knew.;I love this product for just about anything.  The only time I had any issue was making a cake and forgot it is just A BIT heavier than regular flour.
5;takes great and healthy for you!;my 20 month old and i love this juice, just as we do many other lakewood juices..
4;favorite K cup;I enjoy Starbucks coffee and this K-cup is no exception but like Starbucks coffee shops, the price is a little extravagant for what you get. Then again, I find that the nature of using k-cups is a guilty pleasure.
5;Dog that never eats rawhide bones LOVES these!;I have a beagle basset mix who has tartar issues.  I have tried every dental chew known to man, and he does nothing but hide them!  With these, he loves the flavor and he actually eats them.
5;Same as the ice cream stand uses;I saw the local ice cream stand use this brand in the same container to make my milkshakes and they were yummy. We like to make milk shakes at home so I thought I would get some of this.
1;lil devil;Amazed at how much, a company can get wrong. It looks like lemonade.
5;Tastes great.;I bought this to make fruit fly food. When I found out that there was milk in it, I ate it myself.
3;"Anyone know of a 100 percent whole grain ""Ritz"" like cracker?";"My wife and I are giving up on the over processed crackers, even the ones that call themselves ""natural"", when using white flours (organic or otherwise) and omega 6 oils (that definitely aren't healthy).<br /><br />We're looking for a replacement for a ""Ritz"" like cracker from 100 percent whole grains, where the oils would be palm or coconut."
3;Sesmark Sesame  Rice Thins;The product is a known value to us and is fresh. The physical condition of the  product leaves something to be desired.
5;Great tea...;This is the best red rooibos tea I have found!! Recommend it to all my friends..
5;Great for gluten free kids!;I used to be a mom who, like some of the reviewers of this product, refused to buy anything with sugar in the first three ingredients..
2;Doesn't taste Great to my baby!;I ordered this item as I got to see it as recommended by Dr.Sears.
1;Crushed cans.;All my cans were smashed up and one was open. Reminded me of the opening scene in Ace Ventera pet Detective.
1;Candy Cigarettes not like they were...;I recently ordered another box of these candy cigarettes.  I like to keep them in stock for my grandchildren.
5;simply KOESTLIG;Follow the simple directions on the package, it is so easy, the product has been around for 65 years. Very good for Schweine/Sauerbraten.
4;add vanilla beans;This vanilla is very good but not as good as the previous brand I was using, so I just added a couple of split vanilla beans to it.  For the average baker it would be excellent.
2;Tastes like Cough Syrup;I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup.
5;Booda Bone Dog Treats, 9 Pack;My dog loves Booda Bones.  They are a bit pricy so I only give him a couple a week as a special treat.
5;one of the best natural oils on the market;A natural oil having one of the best nutrients and minerals available, it's beneficial as an anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-septic, and anti-viral with multiple uses in bath, body, and skincare applications. A true 'miracle' substance that is also edible and highly nutritious.
5;Beware!;Beware..
5;Musini Crema, White Balsamic Glaze;Excellent..
5;Best Pasta;I love this pasta..
2;Not for Me;I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me.
4;Refreshing summer beverage;I purchased this item when it was on sale.  I wasn't certain if I'd like it but I've read so much about the health benefits of green tea I wanted to try it.
1;Starchy Pumpkin;Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable. I've been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce, but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin.
5;Tasty;I mix the muesli with oatmeal and cook in the rice cooker for Sunday breakfast.  Tastes great.
5;Huge fan, but I can only find them at Rite Aid;This are delicious.  While I'm not a fan of the actually brite crawlers, the brite crawler eggs are one of the best sour candies out there.
5;Good value - Our Labrador pup loves likes them;These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10.
3;"Just ""OK""";Nice idea.  Grinder works great, but I am not too happy with the seasoning blend.
5;Good stuff;This is a really good product. I usually get them from a store near my house but for some reason they no longer sale them.
5;Great shampoo - creamy with nice scent;I generally don't pay much attention to shampoo. I buy whatever is on sale, dump it on my head, rub, rinse, and get on with my business.
1;Very Bad!;If you're expecting rich smooth flavor similar to what you get from a coffee shop you'll be greatly disappointed.  This stuff is basically powdered hot chocolate and instant coffee.
5;"Around our house we call them ""chicken nanners""!";I never feel guilty about giving my dog any treats from Free Range Dog Chews - they are nutritious, clean and healthy.  I love this line of chicken wrapped treats and my dog always finds them interesting and tasty.
1;Earl Grey Tea;I will never order from Earths Natural Grocer.  They sent me another brand of Earl Grey tea and wouldn't take it back without me paying for return.
5;MOST AWESOME STRAWBERRY PRESERVES! Taste like fresh homemade. My family's favoriete strawberry. We buy by the case.;These tast like fresh homemade preservers. I know becasue i make my own.
5;Dog loves this food!;I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier.
4;Good Crunchy Oatmeal Cookies. I prefer soft chewy...;Good cookies. They're made with Splenda.
5;Fresh, pastry chef Bavarian Cream flavor;This is not a clone of French Vanilla by any means!  This definitely tastes like a freshly made pastry prepared the hard way, no shortcuts.  This has a light and lemony custard flavor and feels positively decadent and sinful even though I made my latte with skim milk and one teaspoon of sugar.
5;NOH Haupia is the greatest desert ever mande;In 2006, I was assigned to a project in San Francisco.  A co-worker/friend introduced me to a coconut pudding.
5;Great alternative to the single cups.;These worked great for us.  We are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before discarding them.
5;Picky Puppy Loves 'Em!!!;My pup doesn't have an interest in treats and doesn't eat much, (never has, she's very healthy though) but she loves these treats. I use them in the large black Kong toy and it occupies her for hours.
4;Very Bergamot-y Tea!;****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me
5;Spicy Brown Mustard;I've used Heinz' Spicy Brown Mustard for many years.  I enjoy both the product and the fact I can take mustard with me on my travels in individual packets.
4;Good low carb snack;I know these are an acquired taste. I only like the ones that are plain cheese.
5;Great for Dieters;Great for Dieters. Better taste than baked chips.
5;Great food at a good price;With five cats, buying premium cat food can get expen$ive, but we don't feel comfortable feeding our beloved friends anything less.  At least TOTW is the best priced of the premium, grain-free foods.
1;No!;My wife picked this coffee up to try something different. I have never tasted anything like it in my life, (in a bad way.
2;Should just be called Chili Chips;While high in protein, Kay's Natural Chili Nacho Cheese Protein Chips should just be called Kay's Natural Chili Protein Chips as their is no nacho cheese flavor found in the chips.  While I did eat these because I am trying to increase my protein intake, I was disappointed with the misrepresentation of the flavor.
3;Good product if eaten quickly.;This is a Good product if eaten quickly. the taste was excellent.
5;Delicious blend of Yerba Mate with spices and sweets;I've been a fan of Yerba Mate tea for somewhere in the vicinity of 17 or 18 years and have always had to drink it with a lot of honey to get around the odd after-taste it tends to leave in one's mouth.  This Mate Chocolatte tea solves that problem with its blend of yummy spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and clove) and sweetening agents (cocoa and Stevia).
1;"Very disappointed with ""Pickled E""";I never even received the product.  I ordered 2 1/2 weeks before Christmas, and it was due to be received within a few days.
4;Green Mountain French Vanilla K-cup;I was very happen with my purchase from Amazon.  It was easy, and I received by coffee even<br />quicker that expected.
5;Crisp feeling, clean and effective;And as a bonus, it smells good, too!<br /><br />As a regular user of Pert Plus anti-dandruff, I was happy to try this.  The Clear Men shampoo doesn't have the same smooth / pearly feel to it that Pert does.
5;tea;Worked great. A Good must have for breastfeeding mothers.
5;Refreshing natural soda;What I love about Izze is that it's a relatively lo-cal soda (compared to products like Coke, etc) and it is all natural. There is no sugar in this drink - it is a fruit juice and carbonated water.
2;Don't Waste Your Money!;"I can't tell you how disappointed I was in ""The Switch""!!!  I thought it would be just like another product called ""IZZE"", which I really like!  WRONG!  The cans were only 8.3 ounces, and had just as many calories as the larger bottle of Izze!  Except for the Orange and Grape ones, they also tasted terrible!  The Black Cherry one was especially bad! It was like drinking a juice box with just a little fizz mixed in! Both Izze and The Switch are pricey, but you'll save more buying Izze."
5;delicious!!;this coffee is very good and it has a good flavor to it..
5;Best tasting tea;This is the best tea ever. It has a great flavor without bitterness or after taste.
1;appear to be stale and moldy;i bought these for the fist  time at Petco and they were brown and clean looking.<br />I ordered the 125 count pantry pack nylabone filet mignon flavored minis and they had green and black spots and were very hard.
3;Two Out of Three Agree!;I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone.
4;"Great coffee.  Get whole bean if you want that ""God Shot""";I was first unimpressed at the taste and performance of the Lavazza pods, but I think it had to do with my initial lack of experience with my machine (Rancilio Silvia) and the loosely packed pods as other reviews have mentioned.<br /><br />Once I got accustomed to getting the correct temperature water while pulling my shot and also dealing with the loosely packed pods (I use my tamper to just pack it into the filter basket), I have noticed a marked improvement in taste and crema production.
4;Do you love chocolate?;I'm a cereal lover with a wide range of tastes in cereal. I usually enjoy the healthier varieties like Raisin Bran or Frosted Mini Wheats but I also enjoy the sweeter kinds like Capn' Crunch and Lucky Charms.
4;Good bang for the buck;Jasmine Perl is expensive tea. Numi is reasonably priced and is pretty good.
5;Excellent and delicious;I had a totally different experience than the prior reviewer.  Mine arrived within a couple of days and were melt-in-your-mouth fresh and delicious!!  I usually get them in the gift shop of the restaurants that have rocking chairs on their porch.
5;Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino;The coffee is wonderful with no bitter taste or after taste. I prefer a Cappucino style of coffee with all ingredients pre mixed.
5;Belly Flops -Awesome;My husband and I are addicted to belly flops.  We love the different shapes and they taste just like the regular ones.
4;check the ingredients;the ingredient list in earth's best trumps some conventional formulas for just slightly more. both my son and I am pleased with this product.
5;Worked well for us!;I read many diverse reviews for this product, but I believe it only works if you use it properly. I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids.
5;Zuke's Hip action treats;my dog loves them and I think they help her, even though we do have her on medicine for her hips. You can also break them in half if you don't want to give the full treat all the time.
5;The Best;This is the best oat bran cereal.  None of the others matches it.
1;Poorly constructed and designed;This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well.
5;addicted to these chips!;they don't look very appetizing, but oh my are they good!  very tasty.  i looked up the company and they are an environmentally friendly company.
5;Cat Food;Royal Canin is the only cat food that my cats stomach can tolerate.  I have five cats and that can be a problem to find a cat food that they all can eat.
5;Best for Preemies;My baby was born at 34 weeks and was only 4 1/2 lbs. She spent 22 days in the NICU at the hospital, and this was the formula they recommended.
5;My favorite flavor.;There was a fair in my college and so I bought this for people to try out.  I did this to show people that raw food can be tasty, to go RAW! They kept me asking me where I bought this chips.
5;Wonderful Espresso;i use this for a stovetop espresso coffee maker and it works<br />great and the taste is nice and smooth.  All lavazza coffees<br />are extremely good.
5;mini treats;I like that these are small. You can make your dog happy with just a couple at a time.
5;Like Fresh Grapefruit Juice, But Better. Lighter, Sweeter, & Refreshingly Fizzy.;"I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as ""100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water""."
5;Excellent & Easy;This product is excellent tasting and easy to use.  I've tried to make my own cheese fondue and it just siezes up on me.
5;Yum!;I purchased to try for my families boxed lunches. They loved them.
5;Intense Lime Experience, Delicious and Unusual;*****<br />Dry Desert Lime is an unusual premium Numi tea. It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat.
5;fantastic!;I first bought this in Mallorca and brought it back to the states.<br />Fantastic salt on fresh tomatoes from the garden couples with balsamic and great spanich olive oil.
5;Our daughter LOVES these cookie bars!;Our daughter has several food allergies, so Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars are perfect!  Out of all the Gluten-free cookies out there, my daughter just LOVES Nana's.  NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.
2;ADD SKIM MILK - BANANA - BLUEBERRIES  -  WHEAT GERM + MULTI-VITAMIN for A HEALTHIER CHOICE;"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities."
5;As good as they say...;This is the first and only meal replacement that I have ever tried but I have read and heard about how the taste of some are just awful. With that being said I consider myself lucky.
5;great product for dogs;product is excellent as a training treat or just an everyday treat.  My dog absolutely loves them.
3;I'll pass...;Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea.
4;Great corn flavor, great for cornbread and casseroles;We like Libby's vegetables, and since this case of 14.75 ounce cans ($12.
5;buy this;First of all, before reviewing this product I have some important news- today my family is finally able to bring home the basset hound puppy at the dog place up in Harrisburg!  They couldn't bring it home sooner because the puppy was just too young and I guess at that point they want to make sure all the shots and paperwork are in order.  This is going to be a fantastic day!  Anyway this Nature's Variety Prairie Dry Dog Food is going to be the main dish I serve to our puppy, but perhaps he's too young to eat it just yet.
5;Wow!;I never knew honey could taste this good. I have never been a big fan of honey because of the weird aftertaste I always experienced.
5;Cherries from heaven;I love dried cherries and I could take up a LOT of your time raving about them. Or I could just say they were the perfect combination of sweet and tart.
5;If You Luv Gardetto's Then This is a Must;"If you Love Gardetto's then these are a great buy, used to get them at Costco in a big bag before Costco went all weird, but seriously this is 10 pounds of these devilishly tasty little snacks, I know ""mom"" that these things are loaded with sodium and other evil things, but Dang their sooooo good.  The snacks arrived in one huge box and they are super fresh and compared at what your paying at the super market per pound for these, it is a great value(just as you don't look at the long term cost of eating these critters)."
5;Great gift fr caramel lovers.;"I have a few family members who are absolutely addicted to caramels, and they both now have a new ""favorite"".  I had one and the sea salt added in with the caramels is GREAT."
5;Nutritious and fun-to-use;I admit..
5;Arrived perfectly;My mother loves this water, and she cannot buy it in West Virginia where she lives.  I found it on Amazon and had it delivered to her.
5;Helps my dog with sensitive stomach;"My dog has a ""sensitive"" stomach, meaning she vomits and has diarrhea whenever we switch foods.  However, I wanted her to have the healthiest food possible."
5;Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats;My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods.
5;cookies are old expiration date is in one month!;My dog enjoys the cookies, they would be healthy, but not when they are old.  The expiration date is in November and I received the shipment in October.
4;Tasty, but tiny!;I was expecting something akin to cheese-flavored rice cakes. These were much tastier! Crunchier too.
5;I don't even have a dog :);I used these for party favor bags because I like the colors and they matched by ballons and ribbons.  They are bigger than regular favor bags and will rip if you put something really heavy or pointy in them, but easy enough for the kids to rip open and get to the prizes.
5;These may be the best pickles you will ever eat.;These pickles are ADDICTIVE. From the first time I sampled one at the Rosemeade Market and Greenhouse in Carrollton, TX, I have been obsessed.
4;you won't miss the salt;"I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order ""with added salt."
4;Milk and honey;Toblerone is singular chocolate.  I normally don't care that much for milk chocolate but the honey and nougat make the milk chocolate to die for and the dark chocolate is great without being too bitter.
5;Great snack;I do not know why more stores do not carry these. The cheese has just the right texture for dipping and has a nice cheesy taste.
1;Not a fan;I really wanted to like this product.  Even after all of my friends told me I didn't need a separate appliance to make babyfood (just use your food processor!), I went ahead and bought it.
5;Great coffee cake.;I have purchased this item in the past.  I intended it as one for home and one for a gift.
1;Quality control has become a problem;I have loved Emeril's coffee for years. I ordered 4 boxes which arrived a few days ago.
1;Way too sweet;We love fig bars and wanted more natural option than grocery store.  But these are not edible, even my toddler won't eat them because they are just too sweet.
3;Good Tea but not Thai...;So I bought this tea thinking it was the same as the Thai tea that is served at Thai Restaraunts but its not. This tea is very coconutty which theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same restaraunt type if thats what youre looking for.
5;Delicious product for a good deal;I typically bought Now brand golden flax seeds from local healthful stores. However, once I realized that Amazon offered this product, I ordered from them for convenience and savings.
5;Decent tea for a moderately picky tea lover;I am not a real connoisseur of loose teas, but I do like decent black tea with no added flavors, just loose black tea like indian or ceylon teas or maybe some blends like irish or english breakfast. This is a perfect example - relatively inexpensive but good tasting with full, rich flavor.
5;Most excellent;This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy-sweet flavor that's really unique.
5;Dilmah's Excellent Tea;I first tasted Dilmah 5 years ago at a luxury hotel in Singapore.<br />The bouquet, taste and after-taste of the tea were superb.
5;Review on TASTE;I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way).
4;fruity blend;I liked it a lot.  Not too sweet and very fruity.
1;Not hot;I thought this was supposed to be hot. I took a dab and it was nothing.
5;Delicious and a great value!;My friend told me about this product, so I decided to order it. It is great for baking-I substitute a portion of the fat in a recipe.
5;DELICIOUS!!!;Very easy to make. I did modify the temperature and baking time, after reading some of the other reviews.
5;yummy;great product, nice selection! only thing I would suggest is a faster shipping since the chocolates on the zebra cones melted..
5;Great stuff;This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it.
5;Sugar Free and Delicious;Between dieting and post nasal drip, I had to drop the cinnamon altoids that I loved.  Then I found this.
1;Yuk!;This is by far the nastiest thing I have ever put in my mouth..
5;My dogs love them!;My dogs love these biscuits.  Petco used to carry them but we cannot find them at our store any longer.
5;Now that's the flavor I've been missing!;This is a must for getting that movie theater popcorn taste at home.  I love this stuff and can't recommend it enough.
4;Not a bargain;My cats love, love, love these.  The product is great but the price here doesn't make it cost-effective to order from Amazon (hence, the four stars).
5;Fresh Walnut Butter;This is the first time I've tried Fastachi Walnut Butter and can't believe how fresh and tasty this was even though it's just plain walnuts.  It's not like a smooth spread like peanut butter but it's still spreadable and it's so delicious on top of salted crackers.
5;Dr Becker is like Mr Pibb;Dr Becker has a taste like Mr Pibb, but a bit better - a little closer to Dr Pepper. I first tried this one at a health food store in Jacksboro, TX.
5;The Best Cayenne I have ever used!;After thorough research, I decided to purchase this Cayenne and this is the best product I have ever used to aid in losing weight and slimming my tummy after birth. I have used it for about 8 months now and still have it in stock.
1;New package, new warnings;I am very depressed..
5;Great cider!;My family loves this hot apple cider! It has full, sweet, spiced flavor even on the 10-ounce cup setting.<br /><br />There are 80 calories per serving.
5;Chef Paul Says it all!;My friends and family think I am a cooking genious..
5;Better than going to the store to buy them!;The chips came in a big box with great packaging so that none of the bags were squished. Overall i'm happy with the purchase and would order it again after I run out.
5;Best Ginseng Coffee Mix;I absolutely love this coffee, we mix it in our mochas and frappucinos. The negative is that it does contain TFAs and shipping is quite pricey.
5;Best non-whey non-soy alternative;Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.
1;Hidden Ingredients - disappointing;"Amy's always has delicious organic and vegetarian food options, which is a wonderful thing, but unfortunately on some of their products they choose to hide ingredients. Amy's Southwestern chili is one of these items - it apparently contains ""spices,"" but Amy's does not respect consumers enough to reveal exactly what those spices are."
4;Yummy;I got these rice cake because I love crunchy snack that is somewhat healthy.  I do put butter on it though.
1;Very disappointed...  :(;I was really upset about the flavor of this product.  I bought two cases, spent more than $40 and the only person in my house who will eat it is the dog.
2;Tastes good but DEVIOUS Nutritional Information;Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.
5;Dogs Love It.;Have been using Core products for several years.  I supplement dry food with a little canned food and I prefer grain free for my dogs.
4;This formula helped our colicky baby;Unlike others, I am reviewing the product itself, not delivery of the product.  This formula has given us our happy baby back.
5;Yummy tea!!;I love this tea from Arizona tea hot or cold.  I call it my bubble gum tea.
5;Great Value;There are a ton of vanilla beans in this package. They are supple and so fragrant, you can smell them without breaking the seal.
5;very delicious;I received it today and tried that with my husband right the way.  It is really delicious, way better than the hershey one.
4;Manicardi Aged Balsamic Vinegar #12;I thought this was a fabulous product for the price.  Great in salads, great on meat and vegetables .
1;$40 for 15 bottles. Thats $2.67 a bottle;DISCOUNT???? Where is the discount here? I can get the 20 oz bottles for $1.29 in my local C-Town and sometimes they even have them for $.
5;"These rate a ""10"" based on dog appreciation";This are a little bit like beef jerky.  They have a pretty strong, smoked odor, and our dog loves them.
5;10% Kona is another favorite of mine;I Love my Keurig, and have tried many flavors of K Cups..
5;Not what I expected.;In trying to cut calories from my daily routine, I examined what foods I ate most often. Peanut butter was at the very top of the list.
5;Lawry's Tenderizing Beef Marinade;This Lawry's Tenderizing Beef Marinade is the best seasoning for beef we have found over many years. It works very quickly - typically 15 minutes as recommended.
1;Not authentic chai;Just because the tea contains all the spices of chai tea, it isn't necessarily chai. The spices are incorrectly proportioned and some flavors such as cinnamon are too strong.
1;toxic levels of fluoride;I would exercise extreme caution with this tea.  I used to drink one cup of China Green Tips Tea in very clean water per day.
5;Kinda perfect;"I'm not that much of a bar lover: a banana or fruit is my go to grab food.  But the KIND Nuts & Spices Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt bar is my new favorite ""too crazy busy to eat a real meal right now"" item."
5;It tastes like real cantalope;When mixed this tastes like real cantalope.  I spilled a little on the counter and the kitchen smelled like cantalope all day.
5;Need help giving your cat medication...try these.;I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.
5;AWESOME! BOLD! DELICIOUS!;These are SICK! I bought barbeque flavored almonds and chili/lime flavors just to distract others while I eat these amazing nuts. They are fairly salty, so I mix them with plain roasted almonds when indulging at home.
5;Love this flavor from Genisoy.;The mint cuts the sweetness a little.  The chocolate is full and robust.
5;Yummy;This is excellent, especially to mix with baby cereal. I make most of my daughter's food, but supplement with a few store bought products and this is one of the best we have tried.
4;Decent-tasting coffee with subtle vanilla flavor;Although Starbucks isn't my favorite brand of coffee to use at home (that distinction goes to Godiva Breakfast Blend), I do like experimenting with different flavored coffees, and so I was interested in trying this new offering from Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee itself is reminiscent of a light-to-medium roast.
5;My boys love greenies!!!;I have 2 small dogs and one really small dog.  They all get one Greenie a day.
3;Decent flavor, very coarse ground - not for espresso!;Overall it is decent coffee - it is not over-burnt and it smells good. Unfortunately, I purchased it to use with my espresso machine and it is ground too coarse to be of any use for espresso.
5;Great cappuccino;this is really good like others are saying just like the gas station ones. but alot cheaper I use two for a large togo cup<br />but again it is really good.
5;Finally, I knew they still exhisted!;You just can't have (fruit) blueberry season without FROSTED RICK KRISPIES. I've gone to Shopt Rite, Acme, Super Fresh, Pathmark, you name it and NO ONE but NO ONE even knows what I'm talking about.
5;LOVE IT;I have always loved cornflakes, being Celiac I have had to buy this product. I absolutely LOVE it, it's delicious, not much different to Kellogs, doesn't have the same smell.
5;Good Times;I moved away from Louisiana after Katrina, and Community was what I missed the most, not anymore! and with the special this month it was the exact same price I was paying 4 years ago. And its still a one pound bag.
5;Best Meal Replacement Drink EVER;WOW!  I've been trying to find a good tasting meal replacement drink for 10 years..
5;Good Stuff;I just want to put my two cents in about this coconut oil. I use to get Aloha Nu and a few others, but I've got to say this is by far the best stuff I've tasted! I take a tablespoon every day after I take my green magma.
5;Tastes bad - WORKS GREAT!;I do a lot of natural supplements and don't get sick too often, but this tea is on the TOP of my list for beating colds, sinus issues and chest congestion.  Both my daughter and I notice immediate difference with the first cup.
1;Buyer beware!;I love Pamela's cookies so this review is not about the cookie but about Amazon.  There are supposed to be 6 packs in 1 order, but I only received 1 pack.
5;Smell free;I have tried multiple different dog foods in an attempt to reduce the amount and foulness of my dog's gas.  This dog food has saved our noses!  Purina One for Sensitive Systems with yogurt was one of the many.
5;Yum;These cookies are delicious.  They're dark, not terribly sweet, and go down far too easily.
4;BE CAREFUL;I took the pill (3x3)two days only but had to stop because my baby started having runny stool ( like diarrhea).  I wish I could take it longer to see if it worked or not! So keep an eye on your baby , you dont want her to get diarrhea.
2;Would not purchase this product again;I prefer a stronger bold cup of coffee, which other review promised this brand/type of coffee was, but I found that I had to use the smallest size brew size cup on my keurig to get any flavor at all, therefore using double the pods ( smaller than regular refills)  don't recommend. Too bad because the price is right.
5;i &lt;
5;GREAT PRODUCT !;This is a great product that normally is not available at nutrition stores or discount stores, given that it has NO flavor. The other Whey proteins on the market are either Strawberry, Chocolate, or Vanilla - and make your drink taste nasty.
5;Amazing Product;I ordered these for a part of a bridal shower favor (with a mug, tea, and biscotti).  These were the perfect complement and everyone loved them!<br />The Madhava Honey Sticks are a great value (definitely the lowest priced item of this type that I found), but they also are an all around great product!  The honey is delicious and pure tasting, no plastic taste that I have had happen with other honey sticks.
5;Works amazing!;I bought this after trying many different things to get rid of carpenter ants.  As soon as I put it in the wall ant started dieing.
3;return need to be made within 3 days;I bought this item thinking that capsules will fit my Nespresso Espresso maker but they did not.  When I tried to make return, i could not because it has been more than 3 days since I received them.
5;A healthy AND delicious treat!!;"These crackers are amazing. I half expected them to taste ""healthy"", which we, as Americans have come to know as relatively tasteless."
1;Look at the Ingredient List;This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.
5;A Heaven on Earth MUST HAVE!!!;Over the top scrumptious mouth watering delicacy fit for the King of Kings!!!  Order processed, baked, and shipped in 2 days, but shipping took 7 through FedEx, hmmm.  Presentation was in very good taste also.
5;tommy boy;"The quality and preperation of this product was outstanding !!!<br /><br />A million thanks to the Esposito family for old world flavor and charm !!!<br />""JUST LIKE GRANDMAS'"".."
1;Dreadful;"Ok, so I'm pregnant, and have to quit the alcohol.  I thought ""hey, why not try this stuff, they say it beats out real wine in some taste tests."
5;Experiencing a Wonderful Taste Journey;From where I should start! From the amazing taste, or the natural ingredients. Do you know? try it and tell me your opinion.
4;A nice treat!;These are a little more crumbly than some of Nana's other cookies that I tried before I found out I should be on a gluten free diet.  But, they are a whole lot better than any I've been able to bake on my own.
5;Great bags - just like plastic ones;I was skeptical at first, but these feel and function exactly like plastic poop bags except they are made of corn which is pretty amazing.  I dont feel so bad anymore about picking up after my dog.
3;confusing label;labeling says one serving has 11 grams of fat but less than one gram saturated. since most of the fat comes from coconut oil the saturated fat should be quite high like in comparable banana chip products.
1;A LITTLE MORE BITTER THAN I LIKE;I have been using Bigelow Thai Chi and once tied Twinnings, both were good, thought I was buying the Twinning, but not so. It was just not to my liking.
5;coffee kahlua;Love, Love, Love this coffee. The flavor is delicious.
5;A great product, you must try!;I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.
5;An excellent pick me up;V-8 really gives both myself and my husband the pick-me-up that we need. This form makes it handy so that we are more likely to use it.
5;Keebler Right Bites Grasshopper 100 Calorie Packs,... DELICIOUS;These are the best of the 100 calorie cookie snacks that I have tried and I have tried most of them. They remind me of the GIRL SCOUTS THIN MINTS COOKIES.
5;Best product in the marketplace.;These bars are delicious and full of protein from walnuts and almonds that are alleged to be protective against cancer.<br />What a great use of candy: to give voice to MODERATES in the Middle East.
3;Too sweet;Item arrived quickly but I thought they were just too sweet for me.  I like spiced cider mix but the caramel and apple pie ones were really sweet.
4;Use this daily - love it-;I read about the benefits of raw chocolate and tried a more expensive brand - I buy this mainly because I put it in my oatmeal every day and it is a very good value - the higher price brands seem a bit more refined. A few months ago there were occasionally a few shells - quality seems to be getting better - but chew carefully in case.
5;I LOVE this stuff;I have been a fan of this salad dressing even before Kraft bought it from Seven Seas 2 something decades ago.  I am crazy addicted it.
5;FAB!!!;My dogs just love these. I mix them with Stella & Chewy's beef patties and some grated cheese.
3;good but rosso is better;Lavazza  is best coffee for espresso. Although this blend is good, the Rossa version is better coffee.
5;Love Coconut?;If you love coconut as much as I do, this is the coffee for you!  This is soooooo good.  My new favorite coffee.
5;A Big Hit!;These jelly beans tasted like the real thing.  The kids had fun tasting the different and some disgusting flavors (like dirt flavor for example).
1;Box is misleading;The box shows strawberries and raspberries on it. The ingredients list dehydrated strawberries and raspberries on it.
5;very pleased;Our Papillion is a very picky eater.  She loves the way this product is prepared.
1;cider k-cups;Wasn't pleased with it. It contains aspartime, which I can't use.
5;Fantastic;"Great price, great taste, love the ""Subscribe & Save"" plan.  I am one who usually runs out of an item before I remember to reorder."
5;Ichiban Desu Ne!?;I first stumbled across this wonderful concoction in a department store in Okinawa. My buddy and I each bought a bottle almost as an after thought (it gets brutally hot and humid there) and wandered back out into the street.
5;The best of the best;"Super Bubble is the King of all Bubble Gums.  There are more exotic chews, more ""hip"" chews, newer chews, chewier chews, and bubblier chews, but Super Bubble pulls it all together in one, enduring, classic gum."
5;Great Chip!;I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great.
5;"Pumpkin Puree is awesome ""as is"" for low cal meal on the go!";"I was using the Pumpee Puree for an ingredient in a soup recipe that also included beets,poached pears and butternut squash. I saved some plain to taste ""as is"" and discovered it was so good that I preferred it that way."
5;Shizuoka green tea tastes best.;Flavorful tea.  I drink it everyday.
5;A hit;The wife loves them.  Tasty with a bit of chew.
4;British Golden Fruit?;Pretty good.  I ordered a single pack to taste test.
5;Great;This cereal is wonderful. Crunchy and savory.
3;Okay but not a home run;I ordered these when trying to find a chicken treat that is USA made. For years I had bought the Waggin Train brand.
5;Wonderful coffee/chocolate flavor;I was very surprised at how good this cookie tastes.  Can't decide if this or the lemon shortbread is my favorite.
5;Wasabi+Soy=AWESOME;The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.
4;My soldier's comments;I know that product because I was raised in Belgium.<br /><br />I send Jules Destrooper to my adopted soldier and he loved the waffles more than<br />the thins.
4;Steel Cut Oatmeal;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;licorice tea;Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
4;Good for older babies, There big!;These spoons are very large. My 8 month old has a hard time eating off them, Im sure they will eventually get used when he is older but for now we cant use them.
5;The best disposable, single-use coffee filter;In my opinion, the best way to make a cup (or more cups, using a larger filter), is to use a first-class paper filter inserted into a reusable filter cone and throw away the filter and the coffee grounds after it is used. Melitta makes the best single-use paper filters.
5;Superior quality product!;We are staunch believers in Weaver's Coffee & Tea -- wife the coffe
5;Definitely a French roast;This roast is for the person who wants a bold French roast. You could make it less bold by making an 8 oz.
4;DOGS LOVE THIS FLAVOR;I trade off foods or mix them for my dogs so they get a nice variety, to prevent boredom, and to better insure my dogs are getting good food/nutrition so I also buy Instinct Chicken, Orijen Red Meat, Evo Red Meat, and several others.  Will try Ziwi Peak at some point -- it is dried and expensive, but the ingredients can't be beat.
2;Chalky Chocolate Truffle;I purchased the product for a Christmas gift and assumed that coming from Bellagio it would be perfect.  The person I gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away.
5;Love Zuke's Mini Naturals!;So far my dog has tried the chicken and peanut butter flavor and she absolutely loves them! I love that they are natural and it makes me happy that I'm giving my dog something healthy. The treats themselves are small and soft.
5;fast service;It was a quick turn around and I wasn't without drinking my morning tea for long.  This order will keep me most of the summer.
5;best buy on hemp protein powder;This is the best way to buy Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein.<br />Buy it in the 3 pound bag and freeze what you are not using.
4;easy Chinese cooking;These NOH spice packs make Chinese cooking easy. The char siu kit tastes pretty good, too.
1;Beware new formula!;Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.
5;Dynasty Saifun Mung Bean Threads;These mung bean threads are great.  I like to put them in soups.
5;Spice Box;This Indian Spice box was exactly what was described.  Gave it to my daughter as a gift and she loves it.
5;Good Gum But Why Pay The Money;I bought the gum so I could do the free super saver shipping.  I was 70 Cents away from it and this was the cheapest thing I could find shipped by Amazon.
5;tastes pretty good;this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't.
5;Great Taste;The taste of these teas are great. but i added honey to make it a little more sweet.
5;Prickly pear syrup;The prickly pear syrup is awesome. As a chef, I use it for prickly pear vinaigrette, prickly pear margaritas, Prickly pear granita, Prickly pear glazed pork loin and prickly pear glazed smoked pork pelly.
5;My Puppies Love It;We have 3 dogs (our children) and we give then theses for a lunch time snack. Well they go crazy when my wife gets them out.
1;ONLY awful because SOMETIMES they are awful;and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.
3;Price too high;This price is ridiculously high!!  I can get this item through my natural food co-op for at least $15 less per case!  Don't buy this at this price..
3;Decent flavor;The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.
1;way too much sugar and too little cocoa bean;If you had a real hot chocolate in Europe before tasting the rich aroma of cocoa beans and were lucky enough to try some of the ready made cocoa mixes from Switzerland or Germany (e.g.
4;Delish;organic..
5;Blueberry Delicious!;I enjoy Special K Blueberry more than any other flavor. When my local grocery and Walmart stopped carrying it, I turned to Amazon.
4;Excellent;Poppy seeds of High quality. Also have used in various dishes such as poppy seed cake, poppy seed and chicken tacos, arbol and poppy seed salsa, etc.
5;Sad it is no longer available;Great product for lunches, car trips, plane trips, visits to park or zoo.  I am really sorry that Amazon no longer has this product available.
5;Mom loved 'em.;After being outshown by my siblings in year's past, I ordered these orchids for my mother for Valentine's Day. This was something of a risk, because (A) she claims to despise Valentine's Day, decrying it as commercial manipulation etc.
3;Just alright soup;The taste was not that incredible. It lacks some creamy taste.
5;a standout product;I'm a male, which means I usually just grab the cheapest conditioner on the shelf (Garnier Fructus, Pert, or some other green bottled generic equivalent).<br /><br />However, after trying this product I'm going to have to rethink my time honored strategy.
5;LOVE the Brezza, makes my life so easy!;I knew I wanted to feed my baby homemade nutritious meals and have a couple of great baby food cookbooks that I purchased. I know I could have used the items already in my kitchen to make baby food but I wanted one, easy, one-step machine that could do it all so I wasn't washing multiple pots/pans/steamers everytime I made baby food.
5;Feb 14 delivery on time and beautiful;I placed 2 order of roses to arrive on Feb 14 and they were both on time, wraped very nicely and beautiful. I would use them again.
4;Great Tea - Bad Directions;"This is really good tasting tea, but the directions for making are wrong.  It calls for ""4 Tablespoons per 1 Cup water."
5;Finally!;I was introduced to the Pingvin Salt Pastiller about 5 years ago in Miami when I met some Swedish tourists who had purchased them at the Duty Free shop on their way out of the country. I was in love.
5;Pretty Good;I am not a Vanilla Cappuccino lover, but this is pretty good! My husband & friends love it. It is great for the price & like I told my DH~~~It's for sure better than a gas station cup of cappuccino & a lot cheaper.
5;Great beans wirhout the work.;I usually buy these at the store. I like the ones in the glass jar better.
5;YUM!;I ordered this without ever having tasted it before and while I'm not sure it's *really* worth the price, it is amazingly delicious.  The Prime/SS shipping is nice, but at 6-ish a bag, that adds up quick.
2;Yuk!;These bars were too sweet and had an unfavorable texture. I used to buy banana walnut bars from Quaker that were chewy and yummy.
4;Brown gravy mix;Very good flavor.  I really like it and can doctor it up with other flavors such as Worchestashire sauce.
4;Good tea, but not my favorite;This tea is very flavorful, good for early pm.  Feels heavy, if you will, so I don't have it much at night.
3;Didn't work so well for me;I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.
4;Tastes silky smooth as advertised.;I normal drink Costco Kirkland water, it is my favorite bottled water. Drinking the two waters back to back, the Kirkland water does taste a bit more bitter than the Essentia.
4;love them;"The date one takes getting used to, but is still pretty good. The ""high sugar"" rewivw is misleading, there is a good bit of sugar from the rice syurp but it didn't cause me any I'll effects."
5;Nice gift basket;This basket was a good choice to say Thanks to my daughter's host family. She was in the US last January.
5;A very nice item, though damaged;These tea chests were half off when I ordered them.  We drink a lot of tea and the chest seemed like it could be useful for storing things, so.
3;Just okay;I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.
2;Disappeared too quickly;We have purchased these several times.  This past time our dog got it out of the holder and ate the whole thing in less than an hour.
5;My 7th favorite flavor;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
4;Good alternative to all the high fructose/food coloring jelly bellies;One of the better organic/natural jelly beans out there.  Not much variety in flavors but my kids love them.
2;Gummy;The product seemed fresh on arrival but is sort of 'gummy' in texture. Didn't taste very good so I just threw it away.
5;An old favorite!;I hadn't eaten Apple Jacks since I was a kid. I remember liking them, and decided to take advantage of the low price and convenience of delivery from Amazon.
5;Everyone Loves My Gravy - Beef, Turkey, Chicken, Pork;I love to make simple roasts with gravy for mashed potatoes, bread stuffing or Yorkshire Pudding - Gravy Master and a touch of dissolved corn starch in stock are the secret to success with any of your pan drippings. Gravy master is not a thickener, it adds color, clarity and flavor to your gravies.
5;This is Authentic Scandinavian Marsipan;This is authentic Scandinavian marsipan imported from Denmark.  This is one of the best brands.
5;Smokin!;If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.
4;Refreshing flavor;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great organic fruit to go;These pouches are a great snack for car trips- no mess, no table needed. Can't beat the price for organic ingredients.
5;best product to calm myself;I like this Natural Calm for the taste and for calming down. I do not have to take any medication because this is just perfect.
5;Perfect taste!;I will buy this product again and again.  Even my kids LOVE this soda.
5;WOW!;This coffee has a great flavor!  I am not sure if I would say creme brulee but it is very good.  Its not overpowering or weak.
5;Convenience, Great Price and the Greatest Coffee Ever!!;I purchase Eight O'Clock Coffee all the time and the convenience, price and the ease of ordering in bulk allow me to never be without my favorite cup of Java..
4;Great taste;The taste is great(tropical punch).  You have to dilute from the measurements they gave you or its way to strong.
4;Quick AND free shippng!;This product works perfectly for my pups-one with a grain allergy.  It is very easy for us to purchase, as we would have to travel 45 miles to get grain-free food where we live.
5;Best tortilla chips snack, period!;We only buy organic natural foods without any hydrogenated oil or MSG. These chips are the best we have ever tried.
5;great food additive with other uses;This is a great deal for Xanthan gum. I used some of this as a thickening agent during cooking with great results.
4;Great for a sore throat;I was recommended these for a sore throat and they worked out really well. But I don't think I would drink them for reasons other than a sore throat.
5;Energy;Nom Nom Nom..
2;WHERE'S THE BEANS???;I really like Sylvia's seasoning so I thought the beans would be good too..
1;Waste of money!;My cat doesn't like them, she sniffs the sticks a little but that is all. Maybe they would be good for a dog, but not for a cat.
4;Fresh & natural;Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.
5;Senseo Coffee Review;We have owned a Senseo Coffee Maker since 2007 and positively love it!  Even though our family prefers the Dark Roast pods, the decaf is very good (we just keep it on hand for friends and family who can't drink the regular coffee.  Thank you for the large variety to choose from.
5;Tastes like home-made;"No ""high-fructose"" corn syrup, artificial preservatives, or any of the other crap that American food companies customarily put into their product. Just water, elderflowers, sugar, and citric acid (a natural preservative)."
5;You don't have to look any further;"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor."
5;Good seasoning!;I can't have popcorn, so I can't speak to how it tastes on that, but I use this seasoning on eggs, in cornbread, and sprinkled on crumbled hamburger while cooking it in the skillet.  It's great - it's cheesey, not too salty, and it makes everything I cook with it taste 'deeper' in flavor.
5;good mini chocolate  chips;Recently found recipe(blueberry scone recipe from America's Test Kitchen) that tastes very much like the mini chocolate chips scones from wildflower bread company in Sedona, AZ.  So had to get GOOD mini chocolate chips and these fit the bill.
5;excellent!;i am very 'picky' about my pepper..
4;My dog loves these!;They are great as treats. The only thing that I thought was kinda weird was the fact that there seems to be some kind of red coloring or something.
1;Don't buy it!;I would not ever buy this again. Sickenly sweet and very artificial tasting.
5;Good coffee;Ive enjoyed the coffee. I was a little skeptical but the coffee tastes great, the pods work great and it is a much cheaper alternative to K-cups breakfast blend or donut shop.
3;Just spicy enough - not overwhelming;I found this a fine addition to both a chicken and a steak sandwich.  I wanted a bit of extra kick without going overboard, and this sauce provided it.
5;Anazazi Beans;This store was very easy to deal with my item was in stock and shipped as promised with no delays.  I was very happy that they carry the beans and had them in stock at a fair price.
5;Unbelievably Great;My now 14-month-old son stopped liking pureed foods at about 9-10 months, but he is devouring the Happy Tot pouches, even this one with spinach.  He squeals when he sees them and can suck the pouch clean.
5;Loving My vanilla Latte;All I can say is WOW. I have another wonderful flavor Click to get my protein in.
5;Delicious;Since we have to be gluten free, it can be hard to find a good variety of grains we can eat. I was so happy to find this rice.
2;70% of the chips in the bag are over cooked;I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly.
5;Yummy, hint of peach is lovely.;I love this tea! It has just the right amount of peach so that it does not overpower the oolong. I can't find this in any of my local grocery stores.
3;Not for my dog...;I had high hopes when I started my 1 y/o golden on this food.  I believe in the quality of the ingredients and the brand itself is easily available at our local petsmart store.
5;I Love the Turtles they were so good.;I love the Turtles. They were not melted.
5;My dog loves them!!;We bought a 3 pack of rawhides JUST like this at **unnamed pet store chain** for 7.50.
4;Dingo's are the deal!;Our little 10lb dog loves! these dingo treats. She worries them until she gets all the red chicken bits out and then gives the rest to our Labrador Retriever who treats them like a 5 minute bubble gum treat.
1;Wish I'd realized it has garlic powder ...;I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of just the few reviews.  Fresh garlic is great.
5;Great Coffee;This coffe is very smooth and robust. Great for coffee lovers.
5;Fantastic flavor!;I LOVE this tea.  It's delicious both hot and cold.
5;Nabisco Famous Wafer Dessert;My Mom used to make this dessert with Nabisco Famous Wafers when we were kids. It's just whipped cream to start, cookie then about 3/16 inch or so of whipped cream in between cookies until cookies or cream is gone.
5;Nancy's Joint Compound;I was glad to find this on Amazon after learning that my local wholesale grocer no longer carries it.<br /><br />Not too many people know that gelatin contains both chondroitin and glucosamine, both of which are used widely to relieve arthritis pain.
1;A Royal Rye Rip-off;The same item is $18 + $10 s&h from the Hodgson mill itself, regular price.  Will be one of the first links when you search online for rye flour.
5;best vegetarian jerky;There really aren't any vegetarian jerkies that replace meat jerky.  Some vegetarian jerkies are so horrid, it is surprising they made it to market.
4;Yum, But Needs More Rum;Tortuga Caribbean Banana Rum Cake is moist and delicious, but I like my rum cakes to be soaked in the liqueur.  I didn't expect this cake to have as much rum as I'd like, but I'd hoped there would be more than there is.
4;Very tasty;Used chicken rather than beef [saving of around 3g of fat per serving].  It was tasty but I do think that the beef would have enhanced the meal more.
5;AWESOME;I have used Frontier dried herbs, etc. for over twenty years.
5;The Perfect Snack;The fact that I ordered myself a case of these rather speaks for itself.  I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur of offbeat snack foods, and these are my favorite of all time.
5;delicious!;Tart? Yes, I guess it is tart--like a lemonade might be. But, my entire family LOVES it! It is very refreshing and I love that it has NO artificial sweeteners.
5;The Best!;These peas are the best snacks!  I'm a vegetarian (which u don't have to be to love em) and they are the perfect snack!  I keep em stocked in the pantry plenty..
5;Doesn't leak;I use these to mix and hold essential oils and carrier oils I am mixing for massage or diffusing or a mix I like to have on hand.  They don't leak, they close easily, and while I'm sure they are quite breakable, the one I dropped didn't break.
5;Dogs love Dingo's;I buy Dingo treats for several reasons. One, dogs love them, two they don't leave stains and three the price is reasonable.
3;Has an aftertaste for me;This water tastes like distilled water with a pinch of baking soda.  I found it to have a slight aftertaste - mainly on the sides of my tongue.
5;Just to net it out, good coffee.;I almost didn't bother writing this since everything i have to say is covered by others.  Stated simply, it's good coffee, excellent price, with less plastic to go into the trash.
5;Taste like real grapefruit;I will second the notion that these are very sour.  I can't eat too many of these like I can the gummi bears.
5;Most Delicious Coconut Chips;I am from a country, where coconuts are the thing. :P we have them on the streets, even on the backyard, pretty much all year long.
2;tasted burnt;I thought this product would be good as I am tired of shelling the nut, but I threw away half of this bag.  Maybe it was just the bag I got but it was over roasted and bitter.
3;Ok;I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like).
5;Amazing!!!;These chips are the best snack since the invention of chips themselves. They are actual baked potato chips, not potato powder or potato starch.
4;Where's the almonds?;I was a big fan of the Cascadian Farms Fruit & Nut Granola bars and was looking for a substitute since they mysteriously discontinued that flavor.  Loving dark chocolate, I thought the Dark Chocolate and Almond might just be the ticket.
5;Fantastic!;The jar pac is a excellent way to carry around baby food jars with extra space for spoons, napkins, bibs..
4;Yummy;I don't need to eat gluten free products, but I like oatmeal, chocolate and coconut, so I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />I have to say I'm happy that people on gluten free diets have such a delicious option.
4;gets you going;I have never been a really big coffee drinker, not much for hot liquids so I thought I would give one of these cold coffees a try. I drank it in the late afternoon just before a charity event I was working, wow this kept me going all night long.
4;Good popcorn, great packaging and service;The popcorn arrived ahead of schedule and the packaging was meticulous.  I have never seen better packaging for a bulk item.
5;Foojoy China Green Tea, 2g X 100 Teabags;This tea changed my life! I had been trying for several years to switch to green tea for its health benefits, after falling in love with the wonderful flavor of the green tea served up by my favorite Thai restaurant. However, none of the green teas in my local supermarkets had the smooth, consistent flavor that I craved.
5;Good seller;It took me almost 2 weeks to get the product only because it was out of stock, but I have no complaints really. I think I will have to put another order, for the master cleanse I dont think this will be enough for 10 days, I could be wrong.
5;Great for on the go and lunches;These are great for trips to the park, car trips, school lunches, and even plane trips (bring tape to cover the hole TSA makes to test it).  My children love it.
5;Gloria Jean's hazelnut k-cups;Easy ordering, fast shipping and much cheaper than at the store.  The coffee is fresh and Gloria Jeans hazelnut is my favorite with just enough flavoring for a very smooth taste.
2;Not so great says my dog;This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.
5;DisposaKups work great!;I ordered the DisposaKups because I have several coffees in bags that I had left over and wanted to use.  The cups work great.
3;"Nice Pancakes, But Not As Simple As ""Just Add Water"" Mix.";This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells.
1;Horrible tasting;I like the flavor of coconut water. I love the flavor of mango.
3;not correc size;This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.
4;Delicious!;This cereal was one of my favorites in the 90s. It's not discontinued as many believe it to be, but it IS difficult to find in stores.
3;Maybe I am doing something wrong;I have tried several types of wheat free pancake mixes & after reading reviews I was excited to try this one.  But I did not care for it.
5;Salt of the Earth;Actually it's the 'earth' in the salt -- traces of red clay -- give Alaea salt its warm-ember color. Claims are made for the nutritional value of trace minerals in sea salts, but I can't confirm any of them.
3;My dogs gobbled it up;I wish the ingredients were a little healthier because my two mini dachshunds really love this food. I should have read the ingredients first.
3;Mint?;This is the first STASH tea I will not purchase again. I won't be giving it away or toss it out to get rid of, but .
5;Best Tea out There;"The spousal unit says ""Best Tea I have ever had"". She's happy, so I am happy."
5;Babies love this!;I have two Chi's and they LOVE the rough rawhide ones but they ignore the smooth ones.<br /><br />I bought the two of the toys that these rings go with and they could care less about those.
3;love this soup;My children love this soup with grilled cheese sandwiches. I only notice a slight difference between this soup and another leading brand.
5;Soft and Yummy!;My best friend just sent me these as a gift.  We are both always on  a quest for the softest G & P's .
1;Last time;Don't buy this product.  They crumble into pieces and do not hold the pills.
4;sun ripened figs;Dragonasbros sun dried figs taste just like the figs from Greece that your grandmother would make.  No preservatives.
4;Great flavored tea;This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift.
5;Easy Peasy!;It's great to have these little packets.  As I eat in a galley for my three meals, I don't want to lug around a heavy bottle of ranch dressing with me.
4;Potentially yummy;unfortunately, I ordered these in summer, and they were shipped without temperature protection as other chocolates are. The chocolates that sere not melted were actually quite good.
5;Just right;Great taste, great price.  I was shocked by the price and then the additional subscribe and save discount.
5;Tasty;I really love black licorice, but I could no longer eat it because of the items used in the manufacture of licorice that usually shows up in the stores.  This is very authentic and gluten free.
5;Amazing Product;I had found this product last year at Wegmans, I bought it but was reluctant to try. However, since we as a family have been trying to reduce our sugar intake I decided to try it using honey.
5;Delicious!;THis coffee is delicious! Midafternoon or after dinner, it is the perfect sit down and relax coffee. Nice Kahlua flavor without being too strong.
3;Most of the crackers in the boxes were in pieces...;I ordered this product through Amazon and found that most of the crackers were broken up into pieces.  I don't know if this was because of poor handling during shipping or just a faulty batch.
1;THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!;Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much.
5;These are amazing!;So, this cereal is amazing. I bought it not being sure what it was like, and I am not disappointed.
5;Gustaf's Premium Licorice;candy my grandparents had. They gave us kids this candy on special occasions.
3;I love coffee-but a bit too strong cold;This is a great product for those that enjoy iced coffee, and strong. I prefer strong coffee with milk, so this one was a bit strong for me.
5;My dog *loooooves* these...;I buy mine from my local pet store and have also bought the petco brand bag of 5 for $10 (in store only). My dog is 8lbs it takes him maybe 5 times @ 30 mins before there's nothing on the bone anymore, and even after the stuff is gone he gnaws on it a bit.
5;Coffee;The Coffee is in a great size because I love coffee and I live at a Boarding School. I am only alowed to leave on some days and this is a great size for me.
5;Love The Flavor Combo;I love this baby pouch.  I feel like some of the baby food flavors aren't very creative.
4;quality peanuts;Feridies has the best peanuts -- large and perfectly roasted.  The spicing is nice but a little too salty -- ironically, the salted variety is less salty and in my view tastier than the smoked variety.
5;EVEN MY HUSBAND WILL EAT IT!;I've been an Annie's Naturals fan for a long while - we have an autistic child and she cannot eat anything with gluten or casein in it - which is present in many other salad dressings. She has a couple of favorites in the Annie's Naturals lines, and this is one of them.
5;Not since the Automat have I found a product or service this fabulous!;I have such fond childhood memories of the early Automats and the Sunday mornings I spent there with my dad.  I love my coffee, especially (like most people) first thing in the morning.
4;Soft and sweet;These are small, soft, cake-like cookies with a fudgey center. Yes, they're chewy and gooey and boy are they sweet.
5;Delicious and gluten free!;These gluten free pretzels taste BETTER than regular pretzels.  They are light and crunchy, but they still taste like pretzels should.
5;chicken flavored doggy snacks;You know how it goes with dog snacks- sometimes your dog will eat them right away and wag his tail- other times he'll be really stubborn about it so you have to leave the treats on his plate by his water bowl.  Eventually your animal *will* eat those treats however, despite being unnecessarily stubborn.
1;Yuck!;I've been eating PowerBars for years, and thought I'd try a double chocolate Kellogg's Meal Bar.<br /><br />Holy cow! It's like biting into a ground-up mixture of styrofoam and dirt that's been compressed into a semi-solid then dipped in overly sweeten chocolate.
5;Good kick, great taste!;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:51 Mins<br /><br /></span><a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;An Acquired Taste - Maybe...;The first taste of Chantea, a beverage with Aloe Vera and passion fruit flavor, is surprising.  The tea tastes like grapefruit juice but with a sweeter flavor.
5;The Only Rub I Use;I've been testing new rubs for the last two years and this is the one I'm sticking with.  It brings the heat, look somewhere else if you want a brown sugar based rub.
3;good, not great;They were good. The foil kinda awkwardly sticks to the chocolate so its kinda like getting into a sticky fort knox.
5;Great Snack for People On The Go;"I'm usually pretty busy during the day so taking time to eat lunch is a real stretch. since I'm on the Atkins diet this is the perfect substitute for a ""sit-down"" a serving is four packets- I usually have only two and that keeps me going until dinner."
1;Choking hazard for 6 month old;A piece of this biscuit broke off and got stuck to the roof of my 6 month old grandson's mouth. He was gaging, but I couldn't feel anything in his mouth.
5;I drink coffee....;..
4;YUMMMMMY!!;Roland has always been a product line i could trust.<br />Full integrity all the way through.
4;good but other flavors are better;This not my favorite flavor but still very good.  My 15 month old son loves them and they are very nutritious too.
4;Nice compliment to healthy digestion!;Although I am not an IBS sufferer I am gluten intolerant and have had many digestive issues. This tea really helps!  I actually enjoy the taste and usually make a second cup with the same teabag right after I finish the first cup.
5;Beats The Afternoon Crash! 8 );I don't know about ya'll
5;Strong but smooth;I wanted something peppy and from the name was expecting a very hearty brew.  It is bold as expected but delightfully smooth.
5;So happy I placed this order!!!;I have been looking for Arrowroot starch everywhere.  If and that is a big IF a local store carries it, it costs about $5 for a tiny bottle the size of a spice bottle.
1;These cause vomiting;We gave Pur Luv Grande Bones to our Golden Doodle and Golden Retriever.  They loved eating them but both vomited up chunks of hard undigested pieces of these bones the next day.
5;Clears painful skin lesion;There is no rational explanation - this water is amazing. A lesion developed behind my right ear.
5;Delicious!;I am such a fan of the peanut butter snickers that were around in the 90's but the new snickers peanut butter squared just isn't the same. (I think it's the ratio of peanut butter to chocolate) Anyway these little santas are spot on.
5;Great product;Product really works. I bought some for my friends and they happy with the results too.
2;Not Really Jerky To Me;The flavor was very good for this product but the texture is far too soft. I had read that and was looking for a softer, easier to chew jerky but this is not a jerky texture at all.
5;great flavor & taste;I am not one to drink fusion tea drinks.  But I bought this one because its coming from a brand I like and I figured, 10 tea bags was a small enough quantity to try it.
4;Greta tasting. Lots of noodles.;Lots of noodles here.  I like the Nongshim brand, it is not like those instant noodles that are mostly packed with air.
5;Great Gift;I got these on sale, a twofer.  I gave them to two friends for their 50th birthday!<br />They loved them!!<br />We had a lot of laughs remembering each candy as a child.
5;Great Green Tea;This is wonderful green tea.  I've tried others and didn't care for the flavor.
5;tasted great;cooked up the eggs on our last backpacking trip 2 wks ago an they were great. tasted ilke fresh eggs.
2;Doesn't have the 'corny' taste of regular yellow;As has already been noted, the kernels are a bit smaller than the regular yellow variety and, to me anyway, less flavorful.  I've been using a West Bend microwave popper.
5;No muss no fuss;My grandson loves the variety this package offers when making his snow cones.  The variety is great.
5;You don't love your pet if you don't serve Weruva;The title to this review may seem harsh, but it's true. The pet food industry is in a sad state and takes huge advantage of the fact that dogs will eat virtually anything.
1;Amazing Grass Orange Dreamsickle;I enjoy Amazing Grass products so I purchased this.  The flavor left a rather unpleasant aftertase.
1;forget the coconuts!!!;forget the coconuts indeed! this product tastes mostly of sugar! if you like that sugary taste you should enjoy this..
5;Great Coffee;I tried Tim Horton's coffee one day while I was traveling with my husband.  I loved it!  Needless to say, I came home and got on the internet to see if I could order it myself.
5;My Favorite Tea;I know most people love the more expensive brands of tea..
4;Starburst Jelly Beans - Much better than Brachs!;Although, a bit pricier than the average bag of jelly beans, the Starburst Jelly Beans are delicious, fruity and are far better than Brachs.  I've bought Jolly Rancher jelly beans as well but, they're more expensive than Starburst brand and taste no better.
1;Where is the blue cheese??;These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again.
5;Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.;I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried.
5;Our favority decaf coffee;This is our favorite decaf coffee for the Keurig coffee maker.  I am pretty sure we've tried every kind, but the Caribou is the one we buy now.
4;Good Product!;I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good.
5;Great Scent!;I like this moisture cream a lot. It feels great on my face and the Jasmine scent is so pleasant.
5;Delightful cookies;A light and crisp flaky cookie surrounding a brightly flavorful nugget of jam. The only problem - I can eat a whole box without stopping to breathe! And buying them by the case makes them very affordable.
2;not great;These cookies are essentially tasteless.  I do eat them but after one the consistency is weird kind of mushy.
5;Favorite Nutritional Yeast;Bob's Red Mill is my absolute favorite brand of nutritional yeast. I've even been to the factory outlet in Oregon! Some nutritional yeast is small flake and doesn't have the same texture as the large flake version.
4;Pretty damn close;Arrived in a timely manner.  Cooks up with very few kernels left over.
2;Not worth it...you'll need to spend more money;So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.
4;Very delicious but not a meal replacement;I honestly don't know if this was supposed to replace a meal like Slim Fast(tm). It says it will satisfy hunger longer, this is mildly true.
3;It is alright, depends on your taste;I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright.
4;Good Hazelnut taste, Great Amazon price;This is a great coffee for hazelnut-flavor lovers.  It's a mild, medium bodied brew.
5;My dog likes it...;This has proven to be a quality dog food for us.  We have a HECK of a time finding senior large breed in our area, and we have Petsmart and Petco to shop at.
5;Best Oatmeal I have ever had!;Recently made this Dr. McDougalls oatmeal and found it the best, the easiest, the healthiest I have ever had
5;Teavana Weight to Go Pu-erh Weight-Loss Tea;This is a delicious tea, but I don't know if it did anything to reduce weight. It also contains Oolong tea which has research behind it to support a slight rise in metabolism.
4;Smooth Move Really Helps Move!;Several people recommended this tea to me when I was on a high protein diet and things got stopped up.  I do not love the taste (sort of licorice) but after adding a sweetener I liked it better.
5;Amazing food;We have a rapidly growing 7 month Labradoodle puppy and initially began using this food after the trainer recommended it. All I can say is that on and off this food is like night and day.
4;Mostly Like This One;I like the smooth, fruit taste, but it's not my favorite.  Smells and tastes like guava to me, but I prefer the mango and coconut of SerendipiTea's Congo Bongo.
2;Missing even a hint of bergamot;I am very disappointed after drinking my first cup of this tea. I wish I would have read the reviews.
5;Great treats.;These are great treats when you want to use them as a training reward.  They are the perfect size and my 6-month old Yellow Lab loves them.
5;NO OIL, NO SALT, Just Corn, Delicious;Awesome Baked Tostadas.<br />No Oil added, the only ingredient is Corn.
1;did not meet my expectations;My baby and I both loved the stage 1 Happy Baby pouches that we tried, so I had high hopes for this as well. To my dismay, it smelled like cat food and was gritty.
5;Surprisingly Yummy Cookies;To be fair, I should say that I haven't ordered these cookies from Amazon.com yet, so I can't speak for the condition they arrive in.
4;impressed;I am impressed with gu lemon sublime.  Tastes great, good consistency compared to others I've tried.
5;My dog rates this as a top 10;These are excellent treats for the smaller breeds.  I recommend these highly to those training pups or older dogs as well.
5;What a treat!;Ferrero Rocher is a morsel of milk chocolate with hazelnut filling.  The candy has a pleasant slighty crunchy taste.
5;Best Pasta Available;We love De Cecco pasta, but our local grocery chain charges a preventative amount for it. We can get it for a reasonable price through Amazon, and get a bunch of it at once.
4;Smells good, tastes good!;This k-cup actually smelled up the office. And it tastes as good as it smells.
4;Good...not birch wood though.;I must say I like the Birch wood better.<br />My retailer stopped providing free shipping<br />and also jacked up the price.
5;Still The Best.....;I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.
5;Wolfgand Puck's Breakfast in Bed Coffee;Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee.
5;Cats love it!;I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.
1;Made in CHINA!!!!;Are you serious folks? From the country that sells us poisoned pet food, lead filled products for children? I am not being presumptuous here. There is too much info out there that we should be VERY skittish even for the most innocent seeming products.
5;head concussion trauma relief;Since a head concussion, it has been hard to sleep on my left side because I would feel pressure inside my head on that side.  The first day I drank Trivedi water I experienced some head pains.
2;Bold, but Acidic and bitter!  Where o' where is my Verona?;Purchased 3, 24-count boxes of Dark Magic based on the reviews
4;This is delicious;This is a delicious cereal that contains whole grains amaranth, quinoa, millet, buckwheat, blueberries, walnuts, CHIA seeds and flax seeds. Flax seeds contain high levels of dietary fiber as well as lignans, an abundance of micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids.
4;Caffaros Biscotti;The product is good but to expensive,especially if your feeding a family of four. Even if it's  a treat door the family.
4;Beautiful drink;This makes a beautiful cup of Latte Macchiato. I first didn't understand why the milk pod/cup was shot into the glass first, then the coffee one, since it looked like the milk is on top.
5;Fantastic Beef Jerky!!!!!!;I LOVE this beef jerky!  I am the Excutive Director for an organization called The Women's Wilderness Institute, Boulder, Colorado - we now have Wild Ride beef jerky on all our courses!<br />Our participants love the taste, texture..
2;The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...;"I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the ""big two"" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard ""bad things"" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed."
5;Refreshingly Perfect Sparkling Lemonade!;This is my favorite drink atm..
3;yunnan;I liked to Yunnan Pu-erh Tea the taste was smooth and mellow not over powering. What I had a problem with, I had the same shaky feeling I get when I drink caffeine.
1;Where's the lobster???;It's so misleading to call this 'lobster' anything.  It's a real rip-off because there's barely a wisp of lobster in it.
5;15 years of Shedding Stops!;My JRT used to shed terribly before I found this brand.<br />I have tried at least 20 different premium dog foods, supplements, & coat treatments throughout her 16 years.
2;Fenugreek tea;The taste is not great, but it's bearable. I could not get used to the smell, the unfinished box is still sitting in my drawer and I've no plans to stock up in future.
4;A decently priced option for those on a gluten-free diet;I just read the above negative review of this product and was a bit shocked. This product isn't the absolute best gluten-free soy sauce available.
5;If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find;I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.
4;Nice novelty gift, mostly chocolate;I will confess I didn't read the description closely enough before I ordered these.  I was under the impression I was getting plastic bottles filled with chocolate liquor.
1;Hazelnut?!?;Ugh..
5;Baby sucked it right up, relatively convenient package;We just used our first pack of this food (Pear and Garden Greens flavor) today at a lakeside picnic. Our son, who is seven months old, was launching himself towards the container and trying to grab it.
1;Not good.;These are very artificial tasting, and just not tasty. And I have a very very high tolerance for artificially sweetened products.
3;Understated Earl Grey tea;Rishi Tea Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea will appeal to those wishing a more subtle use of bergamot than other brands that overwhelm the tea drinker with perfumed aroma. Personally, I prefer my Earl Grey to be somewhat more aggressive.
4;Really tasty;this product is tasty, low calorie and high in protein. It is a little salty on the taste but that is probably because of the nature of being jerky.
5;Best Ever;I have tried many others but have always come back to this one this is the best vegetarian chicken style broth ever its nicely spiced has great flavor and you will not be disappointed. I even know someone that drinks it its so delicious to them :).
1;This Used To Be Good - WHAT HAPPENED?;I have had Rapunzel cocoa quite a bit in the last few years.  I recently purchase more and I can't figure out what they've done to it.
4;Bigger than appears! Holy cow!;I purchased this for my 80lb lab mix for his Christmas present, and I could not believe how HUGE it was. It's a femur AND a knuckle bone, which quickly came detached after my dog chewed away all the connecting tissues.
5;Easy cook;These beans take less time to cook and are very flavorful.  I packaged them in clear containers to which I added some Anasazi designs and a beaded cord tassle - for Christmas gifts.
1;6 month old vomits after eating this;My sweet 6 month old might have food allergies - he's thrown this up about three times now (last time I'll try with this.) He's been exclusively breastfed until now, and I've introduced sweet potato, pears, applesauce, squash, carrots and mixed veggies with no drama.
3;Mints are much better;I really enjoyed the cupcake mints so i thought I would try the gum as well. However, the gum didn't taste as good to me.
5;Liver treats;My dog is not enthusiastic about food.  She enjoys these treats which are light weight and easy to carry.
3;Misleading product picture;Pay attention to the product picture. It displays the canned version, which is 23 ounces, BUT, if you order this particular entry, you will be ordering the bottled version, which is 20 ounces.
1;Horribly disappointing;This stuff has no distinguishable flavor to it, just a stagnant sweetness.  It is just terrible.
5;Best evening tea I've ever had;Soothing and light
2;Too heavy on the dumplings;There's rather too much broth and dumplings and not enough chicken for my taste, in this Dinty Moore offering. It is tasty, in a pleasant, bland sort of way.
5;GREAT dog food but HORRIBLE pacsevere from Amazon!;This dog food is fantastic! A premium quality at an affordable price.  I have 4 special needs Min Pins, and I've finally found one food that I can feed to them all.
5;Tastes great and easy to make!;This beverage mix combines the great tastes of lemon and ginger and does so without an excessively acidic taste or bitter aftertaste. It's a snap to make, too.
5;Incredible Chocolate tea!  Hershey's anyone?;I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.
5;Just what I wanted for my 4th of July cupcakes!;I could not find red or blue locally. I wanted more than little bottles anyway because I decorate mucho cupcakes and cakes.
1;i payed 52.00 dollars for 24 cans of green giant asparagus and received 8 cans! i want my asparagus!!!;So i ordered 24 cans of the green giant canned asparagus for 52.00 and waited for their arrival.
4;This tea is really about laxative;I use Super Dieters Tea as a laxative. It must be prepared as to the directions, and it will work as a laxative.
5;Yummy chocolate;I had not tried the chocolate neccos but I thought I would order and they are delicious.  I will definitely order again.
2;Ehh;While my 11 month golden retriever LOVES the fire plug and the everlasting treats, these replacements weren't a good fit for the toy. He had them out of the fire plug in a matter of minutes.
1;Chatfield's Chips ruined;"If you previously bought the Chatfield Carob Chips pictured in the tan bag, you know they were delicious.  The carob chips are now in a different packaging with ""NOW improved flavor"" written on the bag."
2;Spearmint gum;Your display shows only spearmint gum, but also comes with peppermint. Spearmint is the only kind that i am  looking for.
3;They are smaller than expected;We have bought the same type of bigger pressed rawhide bone-different brands though, and the dog has spent hours on the bigger ones, but these are tiny (our dog is a 40 pound border collie mix). I would recommend these for a 10-20 pound dog.
5;California Raisins;To all did you ever see the commercial about California raisins? That is the bomb. Those raisins are sweet.
4;Crazy Critters;"Regretfully the Crazy Critter ""Fox"" lost the fight against the ultimate shredder .."
1;too bad!!;The item is different from the one that bought from Supermarket and The refill Packing bag is Crudely made. i doubt the quality of the products seriously.
5;THE BEST EVER;THIS IS THE BEST DOGIE FOOD EVER, MY POODLE ODIE GULPS IT DOWN..
2;Doesn't taste right.;I agree with a previous reviewer on the Pez taste.  There are definitely some fruity hints here that do not belong to Jasmine Green.
5;An Excellent Organic Honey from a Producer who Cares;My order was turned over to USPS Priority Mail for delivery to me and, unfortunately, was apparently lost in mail-handling.  I was initially upset with the delay in receiving the product but, when the vendor was appraised of the contretemps, I was notified that a replacement shipment had be sent which I could expect to receive within two days.
5;Fabulous Treats!;I'm from NY and my family and I loved all the Drakes products,including Devil Dogs,growing up in the 60s and 70s.I moved to Wisconsin in the early 80s and they don't have Drakes products in this state.
5;Really Long Lasting Gum - Highly Recommended;This is seriously long lasting gum with a great peppermint flavor and good chewing consistency. I am normally very critical of gums but this is one of the best, by far.
5;A special treat;My wife and I tried this product a couple of years ago. We enjoyed it so much that we started ordering it by the case.
4;GOOD;Good product. Good for emergency rations.
5;doglove;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Delicious;We have ordered several of the flavored Stevia drops from SweetLeaf and enjoyed them..
3;Ok - but the DECAF hazelnut k-cup tastes better;I absolutely love the Timothy's Hazelnut DECAF K-cup - it is my favorite DECAF.  I found this caffeinated version tastes more burnt, and is not quite as smooth.
5;As Expected;I have not yet used this product.  I have ordered the Nutiva brand in the past and like the product.
4;Nice Coffee, Pods Didn't Work for Us;I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.
5;Great food!;My dog loves this food and it doesn't bother her very sensitive tummy!  It arrived on time and in tact. I would buy this food again and I would order from this seller.
5;definatly a new fav from stash;This tea tastes great!  I like it better than the coconut mango oolong.  The taste is more subtle, not too sweet.
5;Wonderful;This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference.
5;Just like Grandma's!;This tea is great, just like Grandma made. It's sweet, but you also taste the tea.
5;OREOs are some of the best;These are great tasting cookies..
5;coconut oil;"I used to buy the Nutvia brand but I think since this is ""raw"" it is a little better for you although Nutvia has very good quality coconut oil.  I just love this."
5;On my list;There are a few coffees I order over and over, Jet Fuel is one of them.  Not only do I love the dark rich coffee flavor, but I love the price and convenience of ordering in the 50 pack.
4;good for a convenience food;I drank this in the mornings when I was pregnant. Wish it wasn't so expensive, but it's a convenience food and good to keep around in case of emergencies.
5;Smooth and Creamy;I am on a sugar-restricted diet and had a hard time finding mayo that didn't have added sugar.  Dukes fit the bill.
4;Good enough for daily use!;It's tremendously self-descriptive. Crunchy raisin bran.
5;Red Beans without Bisphenol A;This is a great product, healthy, low sodium, great taste..
5;mixes well when swirled but not when shaken.;My newest addition likes this product.  I did switch a few times between brands but always stuck to milk based after breastfeeding.
5;Not a fan of biscotti in general, but Nonni's get two thumbs up!;I am not normally a fan of biscotti. Typically, they involve a stale cookie with too much crumble, too much poor quality dark chocolate, and not enough taste.
5;Go to treat;This is a household staple for our dear dog who loves the taste. These treats are moist and firm enough for a few chews.
5;When you don't have time to brew coffee...;When I want a quick cup of coffee or coffee offsite, Starbucks instant VIA (instant) is the best product I've ever used. And the price at Amazon can't be beat.
4;Yummy!;I agree with the other posters  and I like how these do not have artifical colorings and I eat these pretty much guilt free. Since I really like M&M's, these are a healthier alternative and I gobble them up quickly! On the other hand, I will say they are quite expensive ($1.
5;Worth buying again;This is the only flavored k-cup coffee I like enough to order again and again.  It's good enough that I choose it even when my husband has caffeinated coffee brewing in the next pot over.
5;Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet;I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet.
5;I LOVE THESE!!;I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture.
5;My cats now love it!;I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food.
3;Crispy outer, but the filling is too sweet and sticky;This cereal has a crispy whole wheat outer shell filled with a sweet chocolate flavored filling. The outer shell tastes fine and surprisingly crispy for holding a semi-solid filling.
3;Organic, healthy... but tastes weird;I agree with Terrence Aybar's review (at the time of this posting, it was the top review).<br /><br />This is good stuff -- if we're only focused on nutrition and ingredients -- and its texture makes it a nice 'supplemental' snack in between bottles of milk/formula on the way to eating actual baby food.
5;Double Bergamot is Double Good!!!;I like Earl Grey tea, so I tried Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea.  It is really great-tasting.
5;Great treats, Great price;We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).<br /><br />Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross.
5;love this coffee.;this is the best coffee. I've tried many k cup coffees and this one is the best one that i have found so far.
3;Great coffee, problematic k-cups!;I really love this coffee, great tasting and bold.  However, on about 1/3rd of the pods, the foil separates from the cup and blows grounds into the brewer and my coffee cup.
5;Best Chicken Broth Ever;I use this broth for many of my homemade soups and rice dishes. Flavor is amazing.
3;NOT GLUTEN FREE;"These cookies may be ""wheat free"", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients."
2;Squeakers don't last, okay toy;"One squeaker didn't work upon arrival, the other was silent after ten minutes with a pug mix puppy.  Possibly a puncture, but my guess is that the part that allows for air to pass and ""squeak"" is defective or poor quality."
1;It's alright, but not worth the $10;This salsa is in fact quite good, however, no better than other salsa verde that you might find at your local grocery store and that is made closer to where you live. If you're into hot salsa, this one is just a little hotter that, say the one sold at Trader Joe's, but you can hardly tell the difference.
5;Can't beat the price.;Amazon had a great price on these K-cups. Made the perfect gift for the coffee drinker in our house.
5;Goregous and Functional;I'm stunned by how gorgeous this carousel is. It is so nice looking that you could actually mistake it for a piece of abstract art if it wasn't holding K-Cups.
2;Not quite right;I drank it but it tasted a little bit like baking soda.  Lowfat milk makes it taste flat, empty, like something important is missing.
5;Good Cracker;This really is a yummy cracker.  My kids love goldfish crackers and hubby loves cheezits.
1;Vile;Since Atkins discontinued their low-carb bread mix several years ago, we haven't used our bread maker. I was delighted to discover someone was still making a low-carb product and ordered Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Bread Mix.
4;pretty good;I've had other McDougall products I like better but this is ok.  I usually add extra corn to it.
5;Great Product for dogs;I have used these for years as it makes giving a dog a pill so very easy.  Dog thinks it is a treat.
5;The Greatest Tea Ever!  It truly works wonders.;I have had seasonal asthma ever since I was a child and have tried rather unsuccessfully to overcome it with excercise, inhalers and medication.  NOTHING has worked as well as Yogi's Breathe Deep tea.
4;More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.;Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them).
4;product good- shipping not;amazon sent a replacement after my original arrived broken down and covered with ants!<br />The second one was overnighted broken too- but the outer box was undamaged. Of course amazon<br />customer service is amazing- and refunded my money.
5;Great for small dogs!;These are great for small dogs or for training. All good stuff in them too.
2;Ok;"Even though the picture shows ""Gevalia"" brand coffee discs, and even though that's what the product is called, it's actually Maxwell House Brand. The seller at least emailed me to let me know that (after of course the product was already on its way)."
5;BIG PIG EARS;These are really huge ears of excellent quality that our dogs absolutely loved.  The price is good especially since there aren't any small ears in the bunch, unlike the bags of ears we've purchased from a certain wharehouse club.
5;Ginger mints;I eat organic candied ginger for an upset stomach or when I'm craving something sweet and it's the only thing I have available. I think these ginger mints taste much the same except for the texture.
5;Terrrrific!!;Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews.
2;I thought these were made in USA! Nope China!;I too thought these were made in the USA but they are not. My dogs love these but I am mislead again.
2;Just what the doctor ordered - B-L-A-N-D;Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.
5;Delicious and a bargain too!;If you check out the FunkyChunky website you'll see how expensive these pretzels are.  When I saw them on Amazon's Manager's Special for approx.
5;Super-licious!;Wow, good tasting and creamy just like 'real' pudding. The banana cream  is my favorite of these 'diet' treats along with the cheesecake flavor.
5;Just great - LOL;There is nothing better then a broomrape with your manhood..
1;Pizza lover;Received 2 boxes of double pack cheese pizza mixes.  Not what was advertised.
5;Chocolate Lover;This is the best dark chocolate for the price that I have ever had.  I just called the company on the back of the bar and they told me to check Amazon.
1;Not worth it ...;I tried this product, I like the concept, but it's a waste of your money. Making coffee this way is just a big hassle and it doesn't even come close what the pods offer.
5;Strong Taste w/o Bitterness;Coffee is my favorite drug and the first 2 cups in the morning better wake me up. This is one of my favorites to enjoy first thing every day.
2;Doesn't Zig or Zag much at all;This zig n zag ball, from what i can remember from the advertising, claimed to have self-propelled zig/zag action.  All it really has is a weighted ball inside a larger plastic ball, which occasionally causes the larger ball to veer off course.
5;Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging];ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world.
4;Clean taste;When I drank from the first bottle, I wasn't really impressed, and thought it must have been hype. However, a few days later I drank some more and it seemed better.
5;Very good beef jerkey;I really like this jerkey because it's not too spicy, has a good meaty texture and taste and it's the right size snack for me.  These boxed sets are a good price and I don't have to spend time running to the store and paying extra for them.
5;TURKEY JERKY IS GREAT;I really like the product.  It was super easy to order online and have it delivered.
5;Ethylene Glycol;Honestly, I really can't stand the Peach Tea flavor. It's terrible.
5;Smoking Fish;I have found that when I smoke fish, this salt improves the taste of the smoke and the fish. When I smoke Salmon, I will dry rub this salt on to the fish 8 hours before I hot smoke it with hickory.
4;Decent coffee but I wasnt wowed!;I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed..
5;Super Fresh!!;These are great cookies.  The shipment from Amazon was really, really fresh!  Fresher than cookies from the supermarket.
5;"Like a ""Stuffed"" Greenie for Cats";"Our cats are definitely tempted by Temptations!  I was delighted to find that Temptations had come out in a ""Greenie"" dentable form.  All five of our kitties love them and they are like ""crack"" for cats."
5;Delicious;Great product! These snack bars total only 110 calories and keep you full till your next meal. The first time I tried these, I found it difficult to believe I wasn't eating candy.
3;Dog Treats;Newman's Own Organics Premium Dog Treats were thought to be something that my two dogs (minature daschunds) would enjoy, however Heidi, the older of the two dogs will not eat these treats. She is usually eager to get treats but she turns up her nose to these.
5;Dogs LOVE it!;My dogs love these treats more than any other. I see that some of the ingredients are sourced outside the US, but these days it's very hard anything with a Made In America tag.
4;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.
4;good energy;I like 5 hr. Energy drink.
1;You should include cooking directions in the description;"Cooking directions should be included with the description.  These are ""pan fry only."
5;Great cup of coffee;This is by far one of their better flavored of coffee from Brooklyn Beans. I would definitely recommend this one.
4;Tasty tea, lacking packaging;You know your matcha is probably going to taste good when you open up the package and see that the powder is a bright, vibrant green.  However, I really wish the tea powder came *inside* a foil pouch in the tin.
5;She Likes Them;Our picky dog usually walks away from crunchy treats, so I was thrilled that she liked these.<br />I'm weaning her from many of the common treats that I'm not sure are actually good for her.
4;Yummy, convenient, but too expensive;My daughter first tried a similar organic fruit snack in a pouch at Starbucks and had to have more.  These little pouches are very yummy, healthy and the packaging is very convenient.
2;AWFUL;While I'll admit some flavors tasted good. They were all stale.
5;I would use again.;The product was as described, arrived fast and I definitely would recommend it. I had no problems  and it was packaged with care.
4;Super;The product arrived quickly and was well packaged.<br />This is a far more economical way to purchase Rooibos than buying 20 tea-bags ($4.
5;Great Assortment and Well Received;The portfolio itself was lovely. The person that received this as a gift said she enjoyed the assortment and the tea was delicious.
5;Another Starbucks Winner;"Being a dedicated Starbucks Coffee drinker, I was anxious to try the ""Natural Fusion"" flavored ground coffee. (Natural Fusion: a blend of coffee with natural vanilla ""guessing"") Following the recipe on the package, namely, using cold filtered water, adding 2 tablespoons (measured) for every 6 flu oz."
4;Great for On-the-Go;Judging from how my grandson didn't take his eyes off the spoon (since we served this sample at home using a small dish) from the minute he tasted this combination, he obviously would rank it as five stars for taste.  There is no doubt that it is made of first quality ingredients, so five stars for that, as well.
1;So many mixed reviews..;I was really excited and surprised when I found this mix in my local Wal Mart. Given it was a good price, I figured Id give it a shot.
5;Yummy on a whole other level;I first got a hold on this chocolate while living in England.  I can't stand the sickly sweet bars of other companies.
4;Expensive way to get products you miss;Working overseas for the Military has its rewards, but it also has its disadvantages.  The PX system tends to provide the basic items for purchase and so after a while you simply get tired of eating the same thing over and over and over.
5;Superior Quality Saffron;I have been buying saffron from them since the past three years and they have never failed me. Have ordered like 8 of these 1 ounce tins for family and they keep asking for more.
5;Excellent;the tea is very good with honey and I have seen a difference. I have lost 3lbs since taking it.
5;Delicious!;I had never tried Mexican Hot Chocolate before. I purchased this because I liked that it was large discs of actual chocolate, cinnamon, sugar.
1;Way too sweet;I found these wafers too sweet to the extent that you can't eat more than one wafer at a time..
4;Soy butter;This is a great substitute for peanut butter. I have a child with a peanut allergy and we have been eating soy butter for 10 years.
5;Oh so good!;I got hooked on matcha but found the habit price prohibitive.  I was paying $8 for 1 oz.
5;No bitterness;This tea is delicious. No bitterness, and great flavor.
5;Excellent;Excellent product, prompt shipping, and very pleasant retailer to work with. Thanks for all your help.
5;Chip Addiction;You could suffer from chip addiction after consuming these.  One bite and you'll never turn back.
5;A fantastic cracker!;What a nice surpirse this cracker is. I bought this on a whim and it will be a staple in my house from now on.
5;Milk Chocolate cookies;This product was delivered on time and included more than I thought I was going to get - a full 16 packages. I first purchased these in England and have loved them ever sense.
5;Awesome!;I have a couple friends and family members with tons of food allergies (dairy, gluten, soy) who have a hard time finding delicious foods they can eat without worry.  I got some of this for them to try out and they loved it!  It's always great when I can help them find a substitute for foods they haven't been able to eat since their allergies kicked in.
4;Does the job;I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling.
5;Not magical, but close.;This isn't a LOT of sugar/caffeine.<br /><br />It's a LOT of vitamins and some energy blend.
5;Smooth and satisfying;This tea was very comforting and delicious.  Very calming.
2;Im skeptical as to what is in these things!;So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house.
2;"Not ""healthy""";These bars may be made of ingredients you can pronouns, but they are not exactly good for you.  The contain high amounts of sugar and fats.
1;horrible taste;i did not want to order a 2 pack so i did not have a lot of choices. this flavor tastes horrible.
4;Only wet food my kitties eat - and only chicken;After trying numerous brands of cat food, I finally found that this and only this brand, and it must be chicken, is what my kitties like.  They particularly like the white meat, the brown pellets are left after juice and white meat are gone.
4;I like oatmeal;I got a 5lb bag of rolled oats from the farmer's market in Detroit.  Little did I know how hard it was to properly flavor blan oatmeal without adding 2lbs of sugar.
5;Love the new easy packaging!;Definitely the cheapest I've found K-cups for my Keurig.  I don't need heavy extra packaging - I need cheap coffee!!!  This flavor is nice and rich.
5;taste great;This has one of the best taste out there on the market.  I wish it would go on subscribe and save.
4;Very good;Taste spectacular.  Not a single flavor I don't like.
4;Real Organic Chocolate Chips;These chocolate chips are the real thing - organic!  It is not something that you can't find easily, but here it is.  Their only drawback is that they don't have quite the sharp chocolate taste that I have been used to, so I rated them four stars instead of five.
5;Smoothest coffee I have ever tried!;Looks like I finally found my favorite. I have tried new coffee for last few years looking for something I really liked.
2;Not a gourmet product;I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake.
5;Healthy and tasty cat food;Wellness is the only canned food I buy for my cats. I has no by products, preservatives or any artificial junk.
2;Bits and pieces, very salty;My packages came with tiny pits and pieces. :-(  Not one piece was bigger than my thumb nail.
5;4.5 stars for this great food;I bought this food after searching through many websites to find the right nutrition for our 3 dogs.  We decided to give it a try and our Collie/Lab was hesitant b/c of all the junk her previous owners had fed her.
5;great item;I am very happy with this purchase I send these cookies as gifts to my elderly family members who need to watch their diet..
5;Tart and chewy apple goodness!;I have been eating these things for years, and was thrilled to see that I could order them from amazon.<br /><br />I eat them as a snack, just grab a handful and go.
5;PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter;Great discovery!!  Super easy to mix up.  Tastes great as a good old peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with apples, celery, and crackers.
5;Good Product, But Buy Direct from TJ to Save $$$;The retail price of this product at my local Trader Joe is $1.99 which comes out roughly $12 for 6-pack.
5;Gardening made easy;Using the AeroGarden and seed kits is a foolproof method to garden. The seeds sprouted as advertised, and the fresh basil is delicious.
1;Yuk!;I switched to this litter because our usual brand was not among the Subscribe and Save listing and I wanted to take advantage of that great program.  I felt very confident in going with Arm & Hammer because of the 5 star ratings and reviews, but YUK!  We've got 3 cats and this litter did not eliminate the smell from our laundry room at all, which I'm sure is due to the fact that the urine did not clump.
5;This must be crack for cats;My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.
2;All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged;I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places.
5;Great consistency and taste;This was delicious. I was so pleasantly surprised by the texture.
5;AMAZING!;Finally a good strong cup of coffee.  After drinking weak, flavorless K-cups I found this one.
5;Love High Protein Hemp!;I love this product and have been using it for several years.  It is a great way to get extra protein on salads,in cereal, in smoothies and Vita-Mix juices.
1;Not great;I love real indian chai.  I have many indian friends, so I know what chai is supposed to taste like.
5;What bacon is supposed to be;I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon
5;Ditto the other reviews!;In my hunt for good strong decaf, I've tried many. This is the best, alongside Tetley.
4;Great price for a quality product;I love garlic! We add it to so many dishes so we go through quite a bit of it. For the price and being shipped to our house, this is a great product.
5;BEST BBQ Sauce;This is our FAVORITE BBQ sauce. Great on everything, but phenomenal on flank steak! Tough to find in New England, so I hope Amazon will carry it soon.
5;Sweet and Sparkling;This blackberry sparkling juice is delicious.It's nice and sweet.
5;great and has more uses then just salad dressing makes nice rub too and seasoning;This month when amazon offered some prodcuts to try in their vine newsletter this one here caught my eye in particular. I have been a person who's had to eat sugar free.
5;Great Pancakes;My family has really enjoyed this mix.  It makes delicious pancakes that stay warm for quite a while, the chocolate chips retain heat and keeps them warm and moist.
5;excellent flavor on so much;i cant get enough of this , its flavor is so good and it fits in every regular size spice bottle. i put it on nearly all of my meals.
4;Great selection, poor packaging;I ordered the 35 pack and received two of each flavor, and three of one flavor.  I understand this is a random selection, so it's luck of the draw.
1;Nut lover;I am rather a health nut, so I was looking forward to receiving these after seeing an advertisement for them in a magazine.  We live in a rural farming town, and don't have much access to anything other than Planters.
5;The best!;I use this for nearly all of my cooking and baking. It works so well! I usually just substitute this for regular flour in most recipes and it has worked so far.
5;Margarita in a Bag;Great price, great taste and very convenient to order. I found this mix about a year ago at Beverages & More (aka Bevmo) and really liked how it easy it was to make.
5;Dieting chocoholics' dream come true;I've been on a low cal diet for a long time, and with the major sweet-tooth I have, it's not easy . These are delicious and perfectly crunchy.
5;Strong and Rich;Went out on a limb and purchased this based solely on the reviews.  Wisconsin resident so not much ability to get to CA to try things out!  So happy with this purchase.
5;Gret cup of java;My wife is the coffee nut and she loves this. The aroma smells so good I'm temped to have some.
4;Not Bad...;This shampoo does do what it says..
3;Okay;I like the fact that there are no artifical dyes or coloring added.  It doesn't make my cat sick, he has finally stopped throwing up.
4;It's okay;I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker-type product that I can find, i.
5;Nice deep red color, great flavor;This is really good quality paprika. It has the deep red color you look for when garnishing things like deviled eggs, and a fresh sweet pepper taste.
2;Peach Tea;Unhappy with taste.  Not as peach tasting as I would have liked.
5;This is the BEST candy corn;I've tried several different kinds of candy corn. Some were disgusting.
5;Hormone free and ultra quick shipping.;This is my second order from this company and they ship incredibly fast. I order on-line in the afternoon and the dog food is here within 24 hours.
5;Delicious!;"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious."
5;wow!  the best/healthiest Fancy Feast!;wow, this is amazing food..
3;Good Stuff!!!;I don't care for the smell, but it works wonders to guard against breakage.  You notice a difference almost right away.
5;Delcious taco seasoning;I previously had McCormick Taco Seasoning but once that was all gone I decided to give this stuff a try since it was cheaper and ships free thanks to amazon prime. This product was everything I hoped it would be and more.
4;Great Tasting, just wish they were thicker cut.;These are very good chips. The Asian Sweet & Spicy--not too sweet, not too spicy, or salty--perfectly balanced seasoning.
5;Tasty, soothing and actually helps enhance immunity!;Traditional Medicinals Echinacea Plus is an herbal remedy in tea form designed to support the immune system.  Echinacea is a Native American herb and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the US and Europe.
5;excellent product;Damn good product. My cats are very pickie and will only eat certain foods which changes frequently.
3;Tasty but the serving is small;Serving size is a bit small. Fits in a 6 ounce tea cup.
5;heaven;My ex 2 years ago bought me 750 of these babies. It was the best gift i have ever gotten.
5;Emeril's K-cups a new favorite;I purchased Emeril's Big Easy Bold K-cups for my wife who prefers strong black coffee and found this to be her favorite.  I will continue to buy it for her soon as we get to the last of four boxes I ordered.
5;great product;I ordered the Pizza flavor and I really enjoy them. I am on atkins and have been looking for something with a crunch for my salads.
5;Good-but not what I thought a dumpling would be;I am unfamiliar with Southern Dumplings- so these were not what I call a dumpling..
5;Perfect with a glass of milk!;Betty Lou's Gluten Free Fruit Bars (Strawberry) have been such an argument saver for us. Our son is 8 years old, diabetic and gluten intolerant.
5;Best Cookies Ever;I had been trying all the frosted animal cookies to find one that tasted like Mother's..
4;Eco poop;I assume (based on the manufacturer description) these are more eco friendly then the newspaper plastic wrapper and other plastic poop bags we used to buy, that's the positive, which is really enough, however, if they would make a few changes it would be an even better product.<br />1) The bags come in a box as sheets, I prefer the roll style that I can put in a bag holder and clip to a belt or put in a pocket.
1;YUCK!! No Taste;I just found out that I have Celiac Disease. I bought these at a local supermarket really excited that I could  have a cookie after 2 months of no bread or cookies and was very disppointed.
5;great product;"My dog who is only 4 pounds loves this product.  I checked with my vet about this product and he said it ""should"" be fine."
4;Good, not Great;I expected more flavor from W. Puck.
4;delish;i was looking for some different coffee for my senseo, seeing as all i find around (NEPA) here are the same flavors ive already had. i was quite pleased with this flavor, i purchased it on a whim.
5;oh so good;i will start off by sayin the dr. mcdougall brand is a life saver for me.
2;tiny tiny cookies;I actually bought a couple of 2-packs from a local retailer. But I was very disappointed to find out that the 2 cookies are small.
5;Great Coffee;Well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using, I have bought almost 6 packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon. Great coffee, from a regular guy point of view.
4;Full flavor, smooth, doesn't punch you with bitterness;This coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work, yet it goes down smoothly. To my wife and I, that's a good combination.
5;I've been waiting for this for my whole parenting life;Well, I've been waiting for this.  Annie's offers mac and cheese where the cheese sauce isn't full of disgusting things, so I have been buying that at costco.
2;Doesn't taste at all like green tea;Did I get a bad batch?  People here seemed to rate it so highly?  Very bland taste for me.  Strangely enough, whatever aroma is there almost more of chamomile or peppermint than actual tea.
5;So far I love it!;Ordered 4 bottles thru amazon (provided by vitacost and spending 50+ allowed me to get free shipping from them).  It took a little longer than I thought it should but the bottles were packaged beautifully, sealed and wrapped in a way that gave me confidence.
3;Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets;I actually really love the Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets, however the 4 pack I received seemed to be old.  They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.
5;Really Good Coffee;I really enjoyed this coffee. My husband also liked it very much.
5;Super, healthy snack;My toddler son loves these, and I love that they don't contain MSG like the more popular brands found in local grocery stores.  These are a bit harder to find, but I was thrilled to discover them on Amazon by the case.
1;Everything had to be thrown out;They were delivered quickly in an undamaged box. Every milkway bar was cut in half, sometimes in thirds and the edges where it was cut were hard and discolared.
5;Really great treats!;I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety.
5;AWESOME - Worth It!!!;I ordered this a little worried that the cost would not equal the product.  I ordered them and got them in a day and they were AWESOME about to order some more.
5;Genius Idea;"As the owner of a dog who takes daily medication, these are a godsend. Soft and squishier than other ""hide it in food"" options, this works like a charm and is easily molded to any size pill and my dog LOVES them."
5;Sour Candy;The Shockers are great rewards for my students.  They all really love the flavors and have been trying harder to do better in school.
4;Soft and Easy to Chew!;Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies were more choco-fudge than cookies. I found them tasty and easy to chew.
3;I'm not that excited about it.;I purchased a 12-oz bag (whole bean) of the french roast based on the several glowing reviews posted here.  After finishing off the bag, I have to say I'm not too impressed.
5;Wonderful taste;I was a little nervous about trying the taste of this tea but it taste smooth.  Everyday it does taste a little different but not bad.
5;Our Favorite Flavor Kool-Aid;My entire family enjoys this flavor.  The color reminds me of a tropical ocean, very summertime appropriate.
5;Excellent product to help win the battle of getting kitty to take her pills.;This is one of the best inventions I've ever used--a product that actually makes your cat WANT to take his/her pills!  Just put the pill inside the pocket, and mold the soft treat around the pill.  Give to your furry friend, and enjoy a safe, drama free pill delivery.
5;great substitue;I bought this because I have a child with canidida issues, and am trying to cut back on sugars for all my children. It worked wonderfully to make hot chocolate, muffins, and homemade vanilla yogurt.
5;great Iced tea;I recently purchased this iced tea from Amazon, The tea has a wonderful taste, if you like it sweeter you could add sugar but it's great tasting the way it is..
2;Too bitter for my taste, not what I expected of a chilled coffee;The illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave
4;Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey;I use Manuka honey for relief from acid reflex - it works so much better than those expensive purple pills!  This one has an unusual taste and is very pleasant to the palate.  All brands are very sweet but this one has an extra little zing.
5;It really works!;This tea really works! I was skeptical even after reading other reviews but it definitely helps. I noticed increased milk supply after only 2 days.
5;Make a dark fruit cake;I love old fashioned DARK fruit cake but now it seems all the modern fruit cake bakers are only producing LIGHT fruit cakes..
5;Dynamite!;This stuff really punches up our recipes. It's in glass and tastes much better than the stuff in little plastic squeeze bottles.
5;AMAZING FOOD;I have a VERY finicky dog and we tried so many different foods, I lost count. I stumbled onto Orijen Red and thank goodness, my dog absolutely loves it!!.
5;DELICIOUS;I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.
5;Excellent!;I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.<br /><br />I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach.
5;Good on everything but chocolate cake;This pickle is quite hot
2;too much salt!!!;There is the taste of salt, caramel and apple in this.  The salt taste ruins the apple and caramel flavor.
5;My dogs are doing great on this dog food!;Amazon has an excellent price on all the Premium Edge dog foods. I chose this brand after reviewing it on the dog food anaylsis websites.
5;Great way to enjoy in bulk - Cranberry Pomegranate;The Cranberry Pomegranate herbal tea from Stash is one of my favorites, but this flavor is not always readily available where I live.  I was happy to find this bulk supply here on Amazon.
5;RICH AND FLAVORFUL;I GRIND OUR COFFEE EACH MORNING, SO AM A RATHER PICKY COFFEE DRINKER.THIS COFFEE BEATS OTHERS I'VE TRIED HANDS DOWN.
2;Didn't enjoy it as much as I'll like to;Ordered this right at the end of November and was surprised to see that the expiry date was the first week of March. I ended up giving them away at a party in January because I don't think my two young children would be able to finish the many packets before March.
5;All beef wonderful;My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own.
5;The best damn chicken spice out there...;As an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, my hat is off to Chef Tom and his 'Spice Girls' for creating a world-class chicken spice.  This is one tangy and flavorful mix that blows the doors off anything similar one could find at a supermarket.
5;Juicy, fruity flavor;This tea is yummy!  Unlike many of their fruit flavored teas, this one has no licorice in it (yeah!).<br /><br />Smooth berry flavors, but not too strong on any one flavor.
5;Huge bag and great quality!;This bag of tea will last me about a year. I actually have been giving friends some to try.
5;Smokehouse Almonds;Excellent flavor which we can find no where around us locally.  Ate these as children and enjoyed them so much.
5;Best Summer Sausage;Tried various brands, and this is the best for flavor and seasoning and consistancy.  My three year old grandson loves it, causing me to buy a double order monthly.
5;Absolutely delicious!;We have lots of food allergies in our family so it's hard to find delicious, healthy snacks for when we're on the go. My 5-year old duaghter, 9-year old son and I all love this trail mix.
5;Delicious;I love Campbell soups.  I grew up on them.
5;Still my favorite bubble gum - great taste and great for blowing bubbles;I've tried other bubble gum brands, but I always seem to go back to Bubbilicious for its long lasting flavor and how fun it is to blow bubbles.<br /><br />The gum material is not a wimp.
1;First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil );I guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn't mention that the first ingredient is trans fat (partially hydrogenated oil).  Had I know, I would not have purchased this.
3;don't expect restaurant Pad Thai;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:37 Mins<br /><br /></span>tastes okay, although seasoning tastes similar to most of McDougalls seasoning IMO. I'm thinking a little peanut sauce added would make this delicious, and resemble a taste more similar to Pad Thai."
5;Best Flavor and Quality!!!;When I first received this product I was not sure what it was supposed to be, but then I read the directions and realized you have to dilute it with water and also sqeeze the bag around to really mix it up. Once I fully understood what to do, I used it in my sweet potato soup and it was the BEST flavor and most strong coconut flavor that I have ever had in my life.
3;Misleading;Item's picture shows box with 40 tea bags, totaling 2.56 OZ (72g).
5;Absolutely Perfect!;These beans came sealed and when I opened the package, my whole kitchen filled with the amazing aroma of fresh vanilla. They were perfectly fresh and I've made several dessserts with them already.
5;Can't resist them!;I frequently skip meals when I'm on the run.  These bars have 10 grams of protein and they're delicious.
3;OK, but not robust enough for me;I wanted so much to like this coffee.  The price was great, especially after signing up for the subscription and the special Lavazza discount that Amazon had for the month of October.
1;Pee Post - not a hit;I ordered the Pee Post with limited expectations, and was still disappointed.  My dog has not even sniffed the post, much less peed on it even with great encouragement.
5;Makes a great gift for Tabasco Lovers!;My son and I love Tabasco Sauce.  For college, I purchased this gallon jug so he could enjoy the sauce all year long in his dorm room.
5;Great crackers;
5;Great product but Hi-way robbery!!!;This product is fantastic. Not quite as sweet as sugar so I add a tad of Truvia to it.
5;Very tasty - just the right amount of salt and fresh flavor!;I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty.
5;Very tastey;I love this tea its so delicious. I have it as a dessert or instead of coffee in the morning.
1;Not ESE pods!;It is not obvious from the product description but these are NOT single serve ESE-type espresso pods.  They do not fit in our Krups espresso machine at all.
2;Not good;Not my kind of coffee. it tastes weird and kinda smells funny.
1;Really bad!;I buy this same ginger in a bin from the health food store often. The store is on vacation so I decided to try these little bags.
5;Making pizza on the grill;Carmalina's paste is a critical ingredient in my pizza sauce and other Italian red sauces I prepare.  It never disappoints.
4;Suspecting change in formula, but still good product;I've been purchasing this product, as well as the grain free salmon for a few years now by the case. I have 6 special-needs' rescued Greyhounds and although they all require a different 'diet' because of their problems, I keep this on hand in these two grain free 'flavors' as an occasional 'add in' to the fresh-food diets I prepare for them on a daily basis.
4;check the ingredients;the ingredient list in earth's best trumps some conventional formulas for just slightly more. both my son and I am pleased with this product.
5;The best mix of coffees and the lowest price around;I was looking for something that would cost less that Green Mountain coffee and still be in sealed plastic cups.<br />I found that the coffee tasted much better than the Costco discount pods that need to be kept in zip lock bags.
5;can't live without;My dogs MUST HAVE a daily Greenie 1st thing in the morning.  If I run out, there is hell to pay.
3;Seems like normal water to me...;"Since it's the worst part of the summer in Texas, it was hard for me to say no to ""free"" water from the Amazon Vine program. With daily average temperatures of 105 plus (and no end in sight until September), I am always dying to keep hydrated and it just seems like I never have enough water (and I get sick of buying it so often)."
5;Best Vanilla Ever.;I first bought Ronald Reginald MELIPONE Vanilla while on vacation in New Orleans. Now that I've tried it, nothing else can take it's place! Ronald Reginald says it's named after the Mexican Melipone Bee that pollinates the Vanilla orchid- an exquisite background for  exceptional taste.
3;Maybe it helps....;I am not sure if this tea helped but I know it didn't hurt. I loved the way this tea tastes and my milk production stayed consistent while I used it.
5;Green Mt Keurig, Half Caf;Flavor is fairly good. I got this because sometimes full caf, regular coffee is too much.
4;Good instant Ginger and Lemon drink;Th instant Ginger Lemon drink from Gold Kili mixes well and makes a quick drink.  The package does say it is caffeine free, but not much else.
5;Honestly the BEST!;"I just LOVE ""Honest Earth All Natural Mashed Potaotes"", ALL of them!  They are absolutly the BEST instant mash ever with nothing but potatoes in them.<br /><br />They are very difficult to locate and I have no idea why."
5;Brings salad up quite a few notches;I have been on a diet for a while now, only eating oil and vinegar on my salads. I ordered this product thinking it would at least improve the taste a little.
5;excellnt;My hound is surprisingly picky about treats.  But these are his all time favorites.
5;Great product, crazy price;This product is a real favorite with my wife and me. It really does have the best chicken flavor of any vegetarian substitute we've tried.
4;Short-lived chew for heavy chewer;I purchased two of these - one for each of my 50 lb mutts. The older one (4 years old) chewed hers completely GONE within 45 minutes.
5;My favorite;This drink is my favorite.  I love mango and when it is mixed with lime it doesn't get any better.
2;My toddler gave this the thumbs down;"My toddler (24 months old, very verbal, usually will eat anything) took a couple of bites looked at me with a surprised and smirkish look of confusion and said, ""Soupy.."
2;Incorrect quantity on this item;Be careful ordering this item. The quantity listed in the database for this item is incorrect.
2;Horrible Taste;I do not like this flavor. Will not get again.
5;Wonderful soothing floral notes tea.;This tea by Stash Tea is slightly sweet all by itself, has a wonderful floral note to it with a nice arouma. Great as iced tea or for sitting sipping hot tea by the fire on a rainy day.
1;wellness canned cat food;We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.
5;Happy Hips are Great for Old Big Dogs!;My dog, Blue, is about 85 pounds and 11 or 12 years old -- he loves me and follows me everywhere.  Over the last 3 or 4 years, he has slowed down and can't seem to get up as quickly as he used to or bound up the stairs after me.
4;healthy but dreadfull;Its good for your health for sure, but the taste is not delicious as advertised  lol  it tastes kind of bad..
5;CDM Coffee with Chicory;good strong coffee. you don't have to use as much as other same coffees to get a great tasting cup of coffee.
5;Very good gift, affordable;Some quality gourmet food items in here, with a nice presentation.  An early holiday gift in a brown box with the cover sheet like a gift wrap.
5;Customer Service makes it worth the choice!;My son loves this Vanilla milk.  We find supplies at our local grocier unpredictable.
5;Gluten Free Baking made easy.;This stuff is the bomb!  I bake gluten free with a variety of starches and flours, but this is the best I have found for desserts.  I am using it instead of garbanzo bean in my chocolate brownies.
5;Great product for dogs with joint problems;Our dog has hip dysplasia which is a fancy way of saying her bones in her hip joints rub on one another. This food has glucosamine and chondroiton in it which helps lubricate joints and helps to relieve arthritis type issues.
5;Excellent in every way;I received the package in a timely manner. The product was everything it was advertised to be.
5;Best Instant Coffee Made;You will give up brewed coffee for the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew.  Our whole family loves it.
5;Tasty Treat for Dogs with Grain Allergies;My dog absolutely loves these treats.  He's allergic to wheat, corn, soy, chicken, pork and fish, so there aren't a lot of options to choose from, but he really and truly loves these.
2;Not for me;I really like several of the Sahale products, my favorite being the Valdosta blend (almond/cranberries). This one, however, is not going to be one I'll buy again.
5;Wonderful plant;I waited several weeks before reviewing this plant because I wanted to see how it would do. I arrived in a small plastic container and had 3 damaged leaves.
5;My dog thinks this food is a treat!;First of all, I really like this dog food because the first ingredient is real beef, not grains or gluten.<br />Second, the meat has a really interesting texture - like a cross between beef jerky and a puffed snack.
5;my cat loves this;My cat took to this food immediately. I blended some with her old food since it was a different brand, but she actually refused to eat the remainder of her old food opting for this.
5;An organic option that my kids loved!;I have 4 kids and I do try to offer them healthy options as much as possible.  I was happy to find this product at my local Target and my kids really liked this flavor.
5;Yummy;I drink green tea every day and have tried many brands and flavors.  This is probably my favorite, rich body without too much perfumy flavoring.
5;Fun Assortment!;We are repeat customers and really enjoy the surprise package K-Cups.  Fun variety, albeit several de-caf cups in assortment.
4;Best gluten-free mac and cheese I have found!;If you are looking for anything close to Kraft, this would be it.  I like to add a little extra cheese, just for extra flavour.
5;Like I remember;Like I remember when I was a kid.  My mom used this with her sewing.
5;Amazing;This stuff is AMAZING. Like really though.
4;Tasty & Natural, but high in Fat, try the ones w/ Spirulina;These bars are definitely tasty and natural, but they are higher in fat than most other snack bars (16g Fat, 3g of which is Sat. Fat).
5;Excellent selection and taste;I have ordered this cheese selection twice and it is really wonderful. There is a great selection and all of the cheeses are very tasty.
5;Awesome Stuff;I absolutely love this stuff.  I mix it with a bunch of other ingredients - roasted corn, edamame, black beans, quinoa, and scallions.
5;topslisa;Ran across PB2 while researching recipes for the new trend SMOOTHIES! Gives you that PB taste without the added fat, so you can add more ingredients. My favorite is PB2,frozen strawberries, almond milk and a lot of spinach!(can't even taste the spinach.
5;Best GF pizza crust mix yet!;This is the best gluten free pizza crust mix I've tried yet, and I've tried a few others.  My husband eats gluten free because I must, so he is always very vocal on letting me know if a gluten free product is thumbs up or thumbs down--and he really likes this one.
5;excellent;seattle is the best coffee. and the flavor cinnabon is great.
5;Like liquid crack;I love Espresso.  So what is better than a $10,000 commercial machine??  PODS!  This Espresso is really good, even though it is from a Pod.
5;Real chili;This is real chili.  I originally found  it by accident when I couldn't find my old chili mix.
1;Where's the meat?;"Clams weren't bad, but there was only about one ounce of meat in each can. Relabel as ""Clam Juice with a few Chopped Clams"" please! Definitely NOT 3."
5;Best Ginger Beer Ever;Nice and strong with the raw ginger still in it. Superb summer drink on the rocks!!<br />But it's wayy to spendy online.
4;Good flavor, beware has caffeine;I received one packet of the EBOOST Acai, mailed in an envelope. From the individual packet I was unable to determine any nutritional information, or directions for taking.
5;GREAT for Cats w/ digestive/allergy issues;
5;REFRESHING;I don't usually chew gum, but I found out it has xylitol in it, which is good for your teeth, because it kills the hamful bacteria. I bought it for when I go on vacation for those times I cannot brush my teeth.
5;Fun & Different;They weren't mind-blowing, but they were definitely fun.  So far I've tried mine with a beer and a few snack foods.
1;Sugar Free and not advertised as Sugar Free.;I was so excited to brew my first cup of apple cider and so disappointed when I found out it was sugar free.  My husband and I both hate the aftertaste of artificial sweeteners and I refuse to give them to my children.
2;Too bready & sweet;Not my favorite mix of flavors. The banana tastes strange, bars are very bready & seems kind of oily, and tastes like over-cooked bananas.
1;Useless!;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>Hi! I haven't reviewed many products on here, but feel obligated for this one because in my opinion/experience, it's an expensive (in volume) dud.<br /><br />  I have seed/pantry moths that were introduced from bird seed for my macaw."
5;Yummy!;My son LOVES these and it is so much of a better deal to buy on here than in stores. My son eats these up like no other.
5;great food;I got this food for my little one in all the flavors.  I have to say the chicken is her favorite.
4;Great size, but not my dog's favorite;I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues.
1;One of Two dogs accepts them, but shipping is a problem;I've been trying to find chicken jerky dog treats not made in China and these are the closest I've been able to find to this point (but I've found some made in Maine that look possible - I haven't tried them yet but intend to). These are US made, but not like what comes from China.
5;WONDERFUL!;This tea is absolutely wonderful! I'm not sure what the hibiscus is supposed to taste like, but whatever that flavor is, mixed with the blueberry, it is absolutely wonderful and delicious! there's a hint of both sweetness and tang, and while being a good way to jump start the morning, it's a great way to end the night. Heck, it makes my afternoons better too.
3;Tassimo Twinings Earl Grey Tea;The tea made with the pod is too strong for my taste, but we share the first cup and dilute with hot water.  I can make at least 2 more cups with the pod that are perfect.
2;Not a Representative Sumatran Coffee;I purchased this thinking it might be a replacement for the FIrst Colony Sumatran which is currently unavailable.  Pretty disappointing in the flavor department
4;Does not contain BPA!;From the Gerber website:<br />BPA is not used in making the plastic cups for GERBER® pureed baby food products. It is important to note that even products with the number 7 plastic are not made with BPA, (the number 7 refers to recycling information, not the presence of BPA).
5;impossible to ruin;Super love this scone mix. I've never made scones before, I used this mix as a starting point, mixed in lots of yummy stuff (specifically, olive oil, lavender, black pepper, and parmesan cheese), and despite all the edits to the basic recipe, my scones turned out *perfect*.
5;Very Good, Top Quality.;I grew up on the east coast and have been to the northeast quite a bit and other than right out of the tree, don't think you could find better. This was excellent in my opinion.
5;My Dogs LOVE These;My vet gave me a couple of these chews after one of my greyhounds got her teeth cleaned.  Let me tell you, they were devoured by her!!  I have been ordering these for the past 6 months for both of my greys and it does a wonderful job of keeping tartar to a minimum and overall oral health.
5;helps me get drowsy;This is a 2 fold product and you must be aware of this. It is great at making me drowsy before bedtime but it is also a stool softener! So.
5;Top Quality from Spain;Just like many of the best Italian olive oils come from top wine producers, Marques De Grinon EVOO comes from one of Spain's greatest wineries, Marques De Grinon, known for it's exceptional Cabernets and Syrahs from its estate in Castilla-La Mancha. This olive oil is quite complex and rich, more buttery and less bitter than typical Tuscan oils, but every bit as fresh and flavorful.
4;Tastes great but costs much more;I just tried this product. I used one of the entire 3-ounce packages with 128 ounces of water after bringing the water to 180 degrees in the microwave (I like to make tea in quantity).
5;Great interactive toy for dogs!;My two year old Havapoo (half Havanese, half Poodle) loves this toy! She is food motivated and she is smart so I thought this would be a good challenge for her. It took her five minutes to figure out how to remove the yellow cup.
3;STRAWBERRIES CRUNCHY;I PURCHASED ABOUT 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF THIS BRAND. THE STRAWBERRY FLAVOR OF THE PANCAKES WAS GOOD, BUT THE STRAWBERRIES DIDN'T REHYDRATE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM SOFT.
5;Good and Bold;Not sure if they like the name or if the coffee is that great but this is my husband and grandson's favorite. It must be the coffee because I doubt that they'd be wanting more if it tasted that bad.
5;wonderful sweetener;This organic raw blue agave is very honey like in taste.  It does not give me a headache as sugar does and does not have a chemical taste as artifical (poisonous) sweeteners have.
5;Tops in the Popcorn World;This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.
1;Totally Misleading Packaging;Packaging indicates Almond Blend, you think<br />that you are getting almond flour you are not<br />You are getting a blend of that had 44 grams of carbs<br />per serving verses 6 for a quarter cup! You can not return even<br />if package is unopened. Product should not come up while searching for almond flour.
5;Works like a charm;This stuff works, it does what it's supposed to do within 8-12 hours for me. It tastes really good, just like slightly sweetened peppermint tea, it goes down easy and things come out easy.
5;Love This!;Tasty, I love Vanilla, filling.  I have tried it with the following combinations so far.
5;great bear;i bought this for my son and he said it was the great size.  but days later he froze it in the freezer, microwaved it and it turned to blue goo but he froze it and continues to eat it.
5;Surprisingly sweet;"Not nasty like a lot of people said it was<br /><br />dunno know about the health benefits (or the dangers as some people say :-/  )<br /><br />I only rate it 5 star due to flavor since its definitely manageable<br />I add it to <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Awesome, it works great during and after exercise. Just love it!;Cytomax works great for me.  I have lots of energy during long endurance bike rides.
4;Welcome to Flavour Country!!!;This is a very unique but good coffee.  Brew it strong and then cut it 50/50 with hot 3% milk.
4;Crackerjacks with a chocolate drizzle;If you are a fan of caramel corn (or crackerjacks), you will enjoy these. Essentially, they are a heavily covered caramel corn, drizzled over with just the right amount of chocolate.
5;Good Honest Mustard;My husband and I have used Annie's Dijon Mustard for over a year. We used to use standard brands, which were good.
5;Butter Toffee Coffee;I love this flavor!  This is a real perk me up type of coffee--good aroma, good taste. Just what this coffee lover enjoys any time of the day or night.
3;Other Emerald trail mixes are better;These are alright, but I really don't like candy peanut butter (even though I do like the stuff you get in a brand-name jar).  I've also never heard of making smores with peanut butter, but for some reason these have a bunch of little M&M-sized peanut butter candy things inside.
5;Good product but bad price;I like the Spice Islands products and this pepper grinder is a nice addition to the kitchen. It's a disposable grinder so don't expect it to perform like a nice pepper mill.
2;Varies in quality;I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account.
5;Meets baby's approval, hence it met ours;"Simply put, my daughter has decided to stuff as many as possible into her mouth at once, which signifies how much she enjoys the product.  We also now need to teach her patience, slight portion control techniques (""One at a time, sweetie!"" works fine, thankfully!), and taking one's time to enjoy their food."
5;Much better tasting than the Starbucks Brand;We have been using the Gran Crema espresso pods in our Starbucks 'Barista' machine, which comes with the ESE pod adapter. We had alot of problems with weak, or bitter, and outdated Starbuck's pods and found the Lavazza Pods here on Amazon.
3;She must be a picky eater.;My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure.
5;Easy + yummy= GREAT product;Ordered this to go with our new waffle iron because I'd heard how good Heartland products are..
5;the only thing that works;My geriatric, food-hating dog requires at least 5 pills a day. Greenies pill pockets are so disgusting that no dog, not even my picky eater, can resist them.
5;Jet Fuel;This is fantastic coffee..
3;Bland;This beef stroganoff mix is not bad--just bland, not a particularly tasty use of a pound of ground beef and a container of fresh mushrooms.  I thought it was worth trying because it's cheap and it's available in my local grocery stores.
5;Fantastic Vanilla Explosion;Best vanilla extract product I've ever tasted.  Yes, it has sugar in it, 8 grams for a whole tablespoon, much more than you would use for a recipe.
5;One taste and you WILL be hooked.;I discovered these cookies in Italy and was terrified that I wouldn't be able to satiate my instant addiction in the States. These taste like REAL lemon.
5;Chelsiey and I love it!;Chelsiey had no problem switching from her crappy commercial brand over to this much healthier cat food.  No details yet for how it's affecting her, but I have high hopes.
2;Should probably come with ear protection;"When my Keurig Platinum finally wore out, I reasoned that a ""commercial"" unit might be a good long-lasting replacement. I used some of my Keurig loyalty points and bought an OfficePro direct from Keurig at half price."
5;These are the best raisins!;Even my family who believe most organic products are a waste of money, are big fans of these raisins.  They are plump, moist and really satisfy my sweet tooth.
4;Iams Biscuits;My dogs love them.  And they help keep their teeth clean.
5;Died and gone to Rambutan Heaven!;My neighbor just gifted me with two packages of these wonderful fruits! I have never tried Rambutans before, and now wonder what other amazing fruits I have missed out on! They are so easy to open and pop the little fruit out. I just stick the whole thing in my mouth and gently nibble on the fruit until I reach the seed.
4;CRUMBS!;Love this stuff, especially the pumpkin flavor. I keep a box in the car, one at home, and the rest at work.
5;For grandkids,,,, easy really great healthy snack;We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it.
4;White or brown rice flour? It matters big time!;I wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. I try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense(plus lower glycemic).
5;Better than homemade.;Chicken and dumplings are one of my favorite comfort foods, except for having to make the dumplings. I grew up in the South in the restaurant and hotel business.
5;Suzie's Crackers;These crackers are the best crackers I have ever tasted. We eat them everyday for snacks.
5;Looovee these;"I love this flavor of 5 hour energy, I have 3 kids ages 6, 2 and 9 months and let me just say I am tired all the time!! 5 Hour Energy gives me the energy I need to get things done around my house and it doesnt make me feel shakey or have a big ""crash"" when it wears off, I use it all the time.I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
5;The best for the price;This coffee  is a great tasting coffee, packed in convenient solid packages that stay fresh.<br />Priced very reasonable.
4;Sweet Indulgence;Health Valley Cafe Creations - Cinnamon Danish are a tasty treat to keep on hand.  They make a great morning or afternoon snack while at your desk
5;makes excellent toast, gluten free;Love this brand of bread.  High in fiber, tastes great, makes the best toast.
4;Good taste, bad solubility;I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect.
5;Chocolate;Another great example of this fine chocolate makers produce. Good service and fast delivery too.
3;Nice salt on a very dry nut.;OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.
1;received a bag of melted chocolate;I purchased this product for a friend. Instead of receiving chocolate covered beans I received a bag that consisted of melted chocolate.
5;Thank you Kinnikinnick!!!!!!!!!!!!!;It is true, these are fabulous.  I have tried several other brands that not only tasted bad but were hard as a rock.
3;"""Malossol""?";"Guys, do you know what ""malossol"" means in Russian?<br />""Lightly salted"".<br />This particular caviar was actually over-salted quite a bit."
5;Alpine Spiced Cider;I absolutely love this product and have shared it with many friends that were equally delighted.  I would purchase it again without hesitation.
3;good, not great, flavor;"I've tried three different flavors of Starbucks ""Natural Fusions"" coffee so far.  Even though I love cinnamon and sometimes add some ground cinnamon to my coffee grounds to flavor regular coffee, I didn't much care for the flavor of Starbucks cinnamon flavored coffee."
1;Weird;The texture, smell, and taste was dry and weird. Didn't taste like freshly dried mangos.
5;One stop shopping;Product arrived as promised and timely.  It is great not having to shop several markets to find this product.
3;"Gaaak!  An ""extreme"" potato chip...!";"The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart.."
5;Yum !  Hot or cold, it's GOLD !;This tea wins people over whenever I serve it.<br />Iced in the summer, we go through gallons at a party.
5;gluten free fruit loops :)  yummmmy;read about these on the celiac diva's facebook page.  decided to give them a try and WOW! no gluten, casein, soy and most importantly .
5;A delight for fans of ginger.;I bought eight of them on sale on a whim. I like drinking ginger tea and thought I would give this a try.
5;Greenie Clean!;My dog loves these, This was an awesome price too! These are sometimes 40 bucks at the stores for a 27 pack. I will def buy these again.
5;My kitty loves this food;A great food for a decent price.  My kitty is crazy about the chunks, I think they are a good diversion from the usual pât&eacute
1;Seriously?;I haven't tried this popcorn, it is actually for a deployed Marine. However, I looked at the package and laughed when I opened it.
5;Organic;"Great taste and substitute for dairy.  Not ""enriched""."
1;BEWARE: terrible flavor of usually good product line;It looks as if the previous reviews are all for Pill Pockets in general, which are a great product for dogs.  This flavor variety, though, is horrible, judging by the packet I was sent.
1;Hated it!;Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-.
3;Product not as described;Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.
5;decadent treat with less guilt;These peanut butter sandwich cookies had the right combo of salt and sweet. IMHO these taste better and less cloying than Late July sandwich cookies (those are good too though).
5;Mild Tasting;The tea was not bitter and tasted fine.  The price is great ($.
5;Tasty veggie energy snack;I like all the Stonewall Jerquee products. The fat content is somewhat higher than I'd like for very frequent consumption, but if you have an active metabolism/don't diet, it's a great higher protein veggie snack.
5;The Best Hot Cocoa;This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids.
5;Absolutely the BEST and ORGANIC;This is a copy of my other reviews of Muir Glen tomatoes, but I said it all there, so here goes..
5;Rednecks love it too!!!;"No kidding!  This cereal is fabulous and I NEVER buy anything that says ""organic"" on it.  I initially picked this cereal up because I lost about 20 pounds on Weight Watchers last year and I am very careful about total calories versus grams of fiber."
5;good stuff;Like all the bolner's products I've used, the brisket rub is an excellent choice. I use several of them, and I've never been disappointed.
5;Love it!;I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix.
5;Nice product...;Finally got around to trying this tonight with a large tossed salad. Mixed up about a a 1/4 cup of dressing with 1/2 EVOO, and red wine vinegar.
5;best sauce in the world!;This is without doubt the finest sweet chilli [sic] sauce in the world.  I use it with hot or cold dishes, including chicken, venison or roast beasts.
5;green with envy;Love these peas as a kid and they still rank number one on my list.If you can't get fresh peas these will do just fine.
4;Manhattan Style Clam Chowder right here in the Midwest...;My parents moved to Missouri from the East Coast and have missed this soup ever since.  They were always saying how much they would love a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder so  we decided to find someone or some place to  get us a bunch of cans shipped here.
5;Hooray it's back!;I had Senseo Columbian coffee pods on a subscription for some time, and then suddenly it wasn't available any more..
4;A little more chocolate please;Pretty good coffee but since I take it black I found the chocolate lacking punch. Maybe if I sweetened it it would come through better.
4;Very good;My son and I have Cleiac and love the pretzels.  It is hard to keep them in the house because everyone likes them better than regular pretzels.
5;The best tea for kids;"My kids love this tea.  We use it not only for ""tummy comfort"" but also for fevers and many other ailments since lemon balm is a great calming & cooling herb."
5;What's to review?;You either like this product or you don't. I do.
5;Best Raw Almonds Available;These almonds are great. The individual bags are the perfect size for tossing in a purse on the way to work.
5;best oil i have found;I have searched for good olive oil for years and one day my brother in law gave me a small bottle of Bariani olive oil he got in a specialty stoor on Marthas Vinyard. When the oil was gone we were lost.
5;The Best;Discovered this coffee while having my KIA Optimas serviced
4;Great Mixer!;This product is a great mixer. First tried this product in Europe as an alternative to tonic mixer with gin.
5;Great Vanilla Beans;I received my beans yesterday and immediately made vanilla ice cream. The beans were very plump, packaged nicely, shipping was fast, and they were a great deal.
1;It may be all natural-but;Just like canned crab, this lobster may be lobster but the taste and texture of canned is nasty. In no way does it resemble<br />the fresh product.
5;Great Coffee;I love this coffee.  Great flavor, great price.
5;chicken flavored pill pockets;Great product. Great price.
5;Ahhhh Capuccino;It cannot get any easier than this. Pour milk into your frother, use the plunger to foam it up and stick it in the microwave for 40 seconds.
1;They call this baby food!?!?;My 1 year old will eat anything..
5;Thick paste with robust flavor;A Taste of Thai has become increasingly my favorite brand for pastes and mixes. Their Red Curry paste is thick with a rich, robust flavor.
3;Baggage;I love these things! But often the bags are not sealed, making freshness a big issue. Let the company know that the bags often unseal.
3;Too Spicy;I generally like my food spicy, but these noodles are just too hot for me.  So much so that it takes away from the taste.
4;Strangest snack you will ever LOVE!;"Our palates are very ""American"" & salt and chocolate just never mixed on anything we enjoyed--until now!<br /><br />These aren't like chips at all.."
5;Divine!;So flavorful and smells like heaven.  Great price compared to stores.
4;Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin;I've had dogs since I was a kid, and we've fed them everything from cat food to dog food to people food.  Dogs aren't that particular (do you know how much it costs to make 'steak' treats look like steak?  The dogs don't care what it looks like!) but clearly there are some foods they prefer.
3;Kinda tastes like instant;I really like a bold cup of coffee.<br /><br />Generally if I want flavored coffee I will flavor it myself as flavoreds don't come in dark roast bold, however I expect to not have to flavor it to drink it.
5;Delicious macadamias - arrived fine!;I will agree with some others that the shipping method was a little odd - BUT, they did arrive fine, not broken, and quickly.<br />The best thing about these macadamias are the taste.
5;You MUST get this if you love Thai food;This broth is unbelievably delicious. It makes the best tasting crock-pot chicken & veges.
3;How much would you pay for a bag of chocolate pretzels?;If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints.
2;Very delicious flavor, the cream puffs with spices;Bananas taste very delicious cream puffs, after the openings have a very strong taste of the banana flavor, the taste is very light. The shape of a box in his pocket contained plum puffs, filled with very full.
5;Padfilter Magic;I absolutely love this product for my Senseo coffee maker. I had used the MyPods for the longest time but they were constantly leaking after making coffee and the fiters are too expensive in the longrun, so I thought I try out the Melitta Padfilter.
5;Very Tasty;"I use this product with my plain yogurt and add some fresh fruit, thus avoiding the "" fruit "" yogurts that have artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup. For those concerned with calories and sugars, this is a pleasant alternative."
4;Some of my favorite candy!;I've been buying this candy for a few years now, since I found it on a shelf at an Asian supermarket.<br /><br />I love the chewiness and then the slow warming of the ginger in your mouth.
1;Ridiculous delivery;I ordered this coffee and another brand, it seems, about three weeks ago.  I checked this morning, February 8,  and found the deliver is out into March or Apri.
5;skin moisturizer & hair moisturizer;I brought my coconut oil at Trader Joe's so ofcrs the price was cheap 6 dollars and change . This is the best quality coconut oil I have ever used! It make my coarse thick  hair so soft on contact and when rubbed it into my skin it does leave that greasy constancy like other coconut oils.
5;Delicious Wheat Crackers;The Wheat Thins Lo-Sodium Crackers are delicious.  I especially appreciate the lo-sodium feature.
5;Best IQ Dog Toy Ever;It's really a great toy. It has an adjustment for the difficulty and it's easy enough to clean.
5;Coffee Bean Direct Sumatra Mandheling, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag;The reason for 5 stars is the price in addition to great rich tasting coffee. It is fantastic with French press and has good crema with espresso.
5;My fav ginger ale!;I love this ginger ale. Beats any other ginger ale I've ever tried.
5;Delicious;Another great flavor from Happy Baby.  The first one I got, I shared with my daughter because it is so tasty.
1;Didnt like it at all...;I bought it as a change for the Nescafe Tasters choice (which is instant coffee), but we didnt like it at all..
5;Great for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs;I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.
2;Bad flavor combination;I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together.
5;Good tea but the price went up a lot.;I love drinking this tea but a couple of weeks ago, when reordering, I discovered that the can shrank one oz which was about a quarter of the size.  Amazon has a mistake as to price per oz.
5;Delicious;These are better than other gluten free granola bars because they have more flavor. Chewy, but not too sweet.
5;Surprisingly amazing in every way;Know how noodle cups get soggy and are too salty and just get gross after 5 minutes? This stuff is amazing. So tasty that I'm reviewing a noodle cup on Amazon.
5;great deal;Purchased 2 bags and received a wide assortment of flavors.  This was a great deal, having alot of fun eating an individual piece or just throwing 5 in and wondering what you come up with.
4;Pretty good;Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste.
3;Good product, bad packaging;I love this stuff and was elated to find it offered through Amazon for a reasonable price. I ordered the 6-box quantity and received it in a reasonable time.
2;Buy in stores before buying in bulk. Son Gagged;My son normally loves Earth's Best jarred foods. But this was a strong exception.
5;Very Very Good;"I'm so glad to shop at Amazon.com it have everything you need,I<br />love getting my season from ""Marshalls Creek Spices"" it fresh, and<br />taste, and good try it you will like it I'm so glad to know about<br />amazon."
5;UNIQUE FLAVOR;GREAT LITTLE DRINK,NICE FLAVOR. WILL PROBABLY ORDER MORE SOON .
5;Great for your Health!;Once I had the Ceylon cinnamon, I realized just how much of the typical grocery store cinnamon was some kind of filler and not real cinnamon at all. I was interested in the health benefits of the Ceylon cinnamon which helps regulate blood sugar and reduce the very dangerous abdominal fat.
5;Great Product!;I love my Beaba! I love that I can steam and blend in one appliance and clean up is very simple. It feels good to make fresh wholesome food for my son and not feel like its a big project .
5;An everyday drink.;We must have this tea now..
3;Salty?;I don't know if it's just me, but these taste rather salty to me. Perhaps it is the unnatural preserving additives found in the product's ingredients.
5;Assorted hooves my dog likes.;These hooves range from medium sized to large which is great for my dog. He gets excited about them.
4;Amazing, but Pricey;"Ok, it is double the price of my former brand, Purina One. I say ""former"" though for a reason."
5;We LOVE these pretzels;This is the only gluten-free, soy-free and casein-free packaged snack I can't live with out. My whole family loves them.
5;Kicking Horse kicks a$$;I love this coffee, it's organic, full of flavor, and a fair price - what's not to love!!<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, keep the can for future storage..
5;Must be Some Sort of Magic!;We've had our Jack Russell for 13 years. He has never willingly gotten out of the pool before he was darn good a ready.
4;Mostly meat !;I have a cat that has allergies to carbs as grains. His ears get messy, his lip swells up and turns red and he throws up often.
3;Pricey;I purchased these pretzels pretty often up until now.  I came back to make another purchase and find the price has gone up.
5;good service;Product came fast, product came as stated.  No issues.
1;past the expire date;When I received this package today on the date of jan 24, 2012, I looked at the back of the product and noticed that the expiration date of this product was set for the date jan 07, 2012..
5;Very good food.;I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary.
4;This is eggnog?;This is really good. It smells good.
3;Taste fine but lacks punch;I started out with half of the can because the can is labeled as two servings.<br />After about 20 minutes I went back and finished the other half.
1;Bad coffee;This is the worst tasting coffee I have ever had.  I cannot imagine that people have given this 5 stars.
5;Nice, smooth and bold flavor;I drink one cup of coffee in the AM so I really want a good one..
4;good;This is pretty good.  I also like the French vanilla.
1;cake batter flavor;didn't like it and won't buy again, I had to use the whole bottle and still it didn't give the flavor like cake batter enough as compared to lets say Coldstone cake batter icecream.  So for me it wasn't very good.
2;Not too Thrilled with the Sliced Yam, Prefer the Fries;Had to break the slices in half for my Terrier.  The breaking in half left sharp points which I rounded off with scissors.
4;HIGH PRICE;LAWRY SEASONING IS GREAT, HOWEVER, THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.  I CAN BUY THE 40 0Z.
5;Makes Playful Memories;My dachshund, Luna, loves this treat. She is not normally one for playing with objects, but with this treat she acts like a goofy puppy.
4;Not Maynards, but...;I was expecting these to taste close to Maynards wine gums, but they simply just don't. That said, they're enjoyable.
5;Great product;I did some research before getting a kitten.  This was the best rated kitten food.
5;pressed rawhide chews;my dogs love these & i love how clean they keep their teeth by chewing them. i only give when i can watch them however as sometimes big peices come off that could bind up in their stomach if swallowed.
5;VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.;These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy.
1;so gross;"I clearly am in the majority here in saying that I couldn't stand these.  I love all the other varieties of Cheez-its, and I normally love hot stuff (hot wings, ""poppers"", etc) but I disliked these crackers so much that I had to toss them out."
5;High quality food for dog with allergies;Our french bulldog has food allergies to the vegetarian dry dog food her brother and sister eat, but she does very well on this food. We're not sure what she's allergic to, but this grain-free meat-based food is excellent for her.
5;Love these chips;I was sick of spending $1.25 per bag from our vending machine at work, and just don't have the self control to buy a big bag & ration it out.
5;The Peppermint Room;Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.
5;Love it!!;I love these little McDougall soups, I buy them all the time!! I tried several flavors and can't find one I don't like. I'm vegan myself but anyone will like them, they're very flavorful.
5;A great starter pack!;This item was perfect and the teas smell so good! I would buy this item again. I also like the unique flavors, not your everyday tea collection.
5;Consumer;"I couldn't seem to find ""the works"" in the store. I ordered them on line and I received a case of chips in a reasonable time frame."
5;Great;Got it for my husband. Couldn't find it in the stores.
1;15 DECAFS - HORRIBLE SELECTION;EXTREMELY disappointed!  I received 15 decaf coffees!  9 were Hazelnut decaf and 6 were French vanilla decaf.  I didn't order a decaf selection.
5;Loving It;Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens, NY.
4;Just Right and you will love it!;This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right.
5;Porcini Mushrooms - Grade Super Premium AA 4oz;I was not able to find these mushrooms in any nearby stores, so I decided to order on-line through Amazon.  The product came very quickly and although 4 oz doesn't seem like much, my recipe called for only 1/2 oz, so this pack will go a long way.
1;You have bean cheated.;Look at the picture people IT'S not Gunpowder Green TEA!<br />The Gunpowder tea it called that as it resembles Smokeless Gunpowder!<br />The tea leaves are rolled in to VERY TIGHT round Balls before steaming. And while that looks like a good Green tea it is clearly not Gunpowder TEA!<br />Witch is far more expensive as to the quality and additional steps in preparation.
4;Oliver can't wait to play with his puzzle;The puzzle arrived on the earliest estimated day. He loves this alot.
2;Didnt like these at all;I thought these gummy Smurf looked like they would be good and different but when I received them they were sticky and had a strange texture. They did not taste good at all.
5;This is my favorite brand of brown sugar!;I have been using this light brown sugar for a couple years. I just started selling my organic baked goods at the local farmers market and I use this along with the dark brown sugar (also from Wholesome Sweeteners) in my cinnamon rolls.
5;Love  it or hate it;"My husband and I are both American and were visiting a British friend who thought it would be funny to introduce us to ""Marmite.""  Well, as a teenager int he 80's, I'd been exposed to Men At Work, so anything that looks like THAT and ends in ""mite"" is suspect to me."
5;Tea like they drink in England!!;I love this tea!  After getting really fond of tea on visits to England, I couldn't find any in US that seemed strong enough.  It took a friend of my sister's who is from England to tell me about PG Tips.
5;Outstanding;This mix is outstanding.  I also had it at a hotel and went out of my way to find it because I had never had lighter fluffier waffles.
5;shipped fast!!!;My dog loves this stuff. I bought it because my dogs Vet said try it to bulk up her stool to express her anal glands naturally.
5;Yummy!;This was a great buy. The soda taste like the sour cherries you use to make cherry pies.
5;CALM Plus Calcium is great!;Only way I have found to take Calcium without nausea.  It has also helped me to sleep better at night.
5;Delicious;Quick, easy and delicious.  Served it to guests with whipped cream on top.
5;great tasting, healthy snack..;in the mood for a snack, but don't want to damage your health with ice cream or potato chips?  Then this is a great choice- not only is this mix heart healthy, it comes in convenient pouches that are easy to carry (in your car or office, for example).<br /><br />perfect for a mid-afternoon boost at the office.
5;Easy to make and tastes good;I've been buying the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowls for over a year now. They are really great when you want something warm and quick.
5;Great for sore throats!;I grew up drinking this tea in New York, and now that I know it's still available I'll be ordering some more.  It's good anytime, but it's the best thing in the world when you've got a sore throat from a cold or allergies.
1;Too Oily;Fondant started to seperate. May have been due to the weather but even after adding powdered sugar we still could not use it.
2;Not loving it so much;I am a tea lover. I drink atleast 3/4 cups of Yogi, Tazo or other brands of tea during the work day.
2;Not really an Earl Grey tea;This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.
5;A New Suprise;After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures I decided I wanted to try these.<br /><br />Compared to Regular Gummy Bears by Haribo one of the most noticeable things about them (aside from the color difference) is that they are about 1.
5;Great Hemp !;This is by far my favorite hemp protein, and I've tried quite a few of them. The taste is fresh and I love the fact that it is both high in protein AND in fiber, something you don't usually find.
5;Nice flavor;I love my Keurig, and I love Newman's.  Strong, flavorful coffee.
5;Addictive to dogs;It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find.
5;Very good :);Shipped was fast and as described :-)  Was nice to to find a product that is not available here and also have the option to combine items ..
5;Thin Think 100 Cal Bites;Great tasting snack and especially good if you are diabetic and looking for a product that will not significantly effect your blood sugar.  They are surprisingly satisfying considering their small physical size and low calorie count.
5;Excellent and does clean the teeth!;Before giving these treats to my cat Felix, I wanted to make sure to include a vet's opinion of this product in my review. So, I scheduled an appointment and took Felix and the treats in.
5;Wow;Passing time browsing through my Amazon Recommendations, I saw this offered.  I'd never heard of it, but it sounded like a healthy alternative to any form of sugar I have been using.
5;Crowd Pleaser;"I purchased this coffee as an office contribution. I was a little nervous about this coffee after a co-worker's coffee was called ""foot coffee."
4;No lucidity but MAJOR increase in dream recall and vividness!;I would take a tablespoon of the tincture and 1 Galantamind 8mg pill after about 4 or 5 hours of sleep and I started having extremely vivid and bizarre dreams with fantastic dream recall. I believe this would have induced lucid dreams for me if I was better at realizing I was in a dream.
5;Love it!  Best Haribou candy out there;When I was a kid, Cadbury (IIRC) made a very dense gummy like roll of candy.  This comes very very close.
5;It's the best!;Stash teas are really good and this is the best one for me.  I really enjoy it.
5;Tasty Granola;What can you say about granola? If you like granola, and you want it to be additive free, this is for you. Kind Blueberry clusters with Flax seeds has whole grains such as amaranth, quinoa, oats, milet and buckwheat.
5;great drink;I like having Zico with dinner, it really quenches my thirst.  I also like taking it to watch my son playing sports, everyone else is drinking coffee which I never drink.
2;Like the idea of the product, but produces a bumpy finish;I have been purchasing several varieties of this brand of sugar for sometime, but I have found the powdered sugar product less and less acceptable.  It clumps.
5;Good Deal and great shipping;My two Whippets LOVE CET Chewies and I am happy to be able to get them online since my new vet doesn't carry them.  This is a great deal and the shipping costs are reasonable.
5;taxgal;This is the best pasta if you follow a low carb diet. It has the flavor and texture you would expect pasta to have.
5;Delicious!;These almonds are my favorite flavor from Blue Diamond. Not too sweet, not too spicy.
5;Yum!;Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.
5;Tastes MUCH better than Bottled.;I just started using this product, and really like it.  I used to hate lemon juice in a bottle, and if I didn't have a lemon around, I did without.
5;A body wash you won't have to turn in your man card for.;Soap is soap.  At least that's what I thought.
5;Love this item, will continue to order...;I have purchased Lavender pepper before from another merchant and liked it but this product exceeds the quality of the other, I will continue to purchase this item and from this provider.  Received item fast and nicely packaged.
2;Not a value;I found this product(actually the 12 quart version) at Walgreen's for $1 a piece. Not worth it at all.
1;Nestle Bottled Water - Dont Buy;The Nestle brand of bottled water did not taste well at all. If you have tasted Poland Springs or Dasani etc.
5;Very good sipping beverage.;I am a coffee drinker who usually uses Keurig machines and pod coffeemakers as I really don't like coffee that's been sitting in a pot for a while.  I got this product to try as I had read good things about the antioxidants and wanted to see how I liked it.
3;Bitter Taste Right After Drinking;PROS<br /><br />1) It is inexpensive.<br />2) It works by keeping you awake and alert.
4;Fun & Entertaining way to feed my dog;My dog loves his dog bowl puzzle.  I was amazed at how quickly he figured it out.
5;Tastes good and healthy;I was pleasantly surprised by how good the cranberry Newton thins tasted considering that it is a healthy snack. It is difficult to find the right healthy-tasty balance in snacks.
4;Great Morning Fix;I Love the flavor Van Houtte french vanilla, it's not too strong and not bitter. makes a great morning start.
3;NOT as good as the ones in the tins;"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness."
2;Tastes OK, but with a slight issue;It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it.  The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new I'm eating or drinking.
5;Ito En Golden Oolong Tea is phenomenal!;My husband discovered Ito En Golden Oolong Tea at our favorite Sushi bar, and no other tea can match it's wonderful subtle flavors.  This tea is a faboulous blended tea that is refreshing and great with meals or just to drink.
5;The BEST baby food out there!;Earth's Best makes the BEST organic baby food ever!  I'm a first-time mom and this product was recommended to me by several friends.  What I like most about them is they taste very fresh and high-quality.
5;Sooooooooooo good;Unable to purchase local. Now that I'm able to get a supply it brings me back to my childhood.
4;Very good pick-up bags;These bags are very sturdy and large enough to hold any size dogs poop. I find them to be very sturdy.
5;This is what converted me;Brewed coffee is almost non-existent where I am from, and we in our family would almost always buy instant coffee. Brewed coffee never tasted quite right or coffee like to me before.
4;Tastes good;These healthy flakes taste very good even though they are low in sugar and high in fiber and nutritional value. They do lose their crispiness in a bowl of milk, but I either eat fast or snack on the flakes right out of the box.
4;Bitter;I thought this drink would be sour, but it's bitter. Some people like it, most don't.
5;Great on-the-go meal;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
4;Melted quickly, evenly - but very sweet, bad packaging;The chocolate melted amazingly quickly and evenly. So much easier than cocoa or baker's chocolate with fats, etc, in a double boiler! Just put them in a microwave safe bowl, zap em, and set out some parchment paper for easy clean-up of the dipped items.
5;The Best;THis is some of the best beef jerky I have had in a long time.  It has the best flavor of any beef jerky out on the market.
3;hardly works on me, but tastes good;I've had breastfeeding problems since the beginning, and I tried everything with little or no success. A friend recommended this product, and, unsurprisedly, it doesn't seem to have a strong effect on me (but perhaps a 20% increase with the pump? But 20% of very little is not much anyway.
2;Caution, if you don't want a pocket full of powder!;I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats.
5;Best unsalted chips;These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.
3;Great candies, picture does not depict chocolates that arrive;I do really like these candies. They have something for everyone.
5;Perfect snack!;I think these taste super yummy. If you like sour cream & onion flavor like I do, and want a nice snack that isn't packed full of calories, I think you'll love these too.
5;Looks like dog food and tastes like cardboard, but...;Stays crunchy longer in milk than many other cerials.  So, what I do is mix it 50/50 with Craklin' Oat Bran and dump some dried blueberries on it and I've got a very healthy and great tasking breakfast.
3;Good but kind of dry;I usually love Kashi products but this one caught me off guard.  They have a nice flavor but they are kind of dry and pasty.
4;If you like Nuts...;It's actually a tasty little treat provided you like nuts and Apricots. It's truly gluten free but it would be hard to guess if I didn't know that.
5;EXCELLENT SOUP MIX;I absolutely love this soup mix for my roast chicken.  It's the only way I'll roast a chicken.
5;Great Drink, Price, and Free Shippping!;This was a win win win combo.  I don't like many of the Monster flavors because too many have an aftertaste.
5;Daughter's Favorite;This is my daughter's favorite Stage 2 food! This smells great and actually tastes good. Why would I give my daughter something that tasted bad? I always mix her Stage 2 foods with baby cereal (sometimes yogurt).
4;So close to Island Coconut K Cups;When I coulnd't find Island Coconut K cups anywhere, I found this and decided to try it.  Although it is not exact, it is so close it puts a smile on face.
4;Great for a quick iced coffee.;I originally purchased these in my local grocery store and loved them, then searched for the items on Amazon where I was able to purchase a larger quantity for a great price.<br /><br />The Via iced coffee isn't quite as good as if went to Starbucks and purchased it directly from them, and it comes already sweetened, so you don't have the option to customize your drink with Splenda, etc.
4;Smooth, subtle lemony note;I enjoy this tea, it has a nice subtle lemony note from lemongrass. I usually find green teas to have a grassy hay or straw kind of taste.
5;A cup of Ireland;This is what I drink whenever I go back to ireland and it's what I drink in the states. Awesome.
5;just like pf changs;My husband loves the tea at PF Changs so we found out what it was, and this is it.  He is addicted.
5;Best Nut Mix Out There;These are the best nuts I've found. I'm totally addicted.
1;nasty;i thought this would be a great tasting drink. i got it for my kids because my kids love blueberries.
5;Heinz Salad Cream;This is the most wonderful tasting salad dressing in existence. It is used more than any other in the UK and I find it hard to believe that it is not on the shelves of every supermarket in the United States, but I have never seen it there.
5;Perfect movie-style popcorn;"Why go to the movies, when you can enjoy movie-style popcorn in your ""man-room?""  Popcorn pops perfect every time.  It even tastes good a few days later."
5;Lower Cholesterol without Drugs;Lowered my cholesterol 25% in just 4 months with this product.  You just have to be diligent about it.
4;A nice, bite sized snack;All three hounds ate these quite enthusiastically. They're made in the USA, and have a lengthy list of ingredients that all appear to be healthy, a good mix of protein fat and fiber.
5;EXCELENTE SAL MARINA NATURAL;MAS PERSONAS DEBERIAMOS INCLINARNOS A USAR ESTA SAL Y TENER LOS MINERALES NECESARIOS CON ESTE SIMPLE USO PARA NUESTRO CUERPO.  LA USE POR PAR DE MESES ESTE PAQUETITO Y LA RECOMIENDO.
5;The best we has yet;We heard about this coffee before leaving for Jamaica so we pick up some and have fell in love with it.  The best we have had yet smooth without that bitter after taste so many other coffee have.
5;Jet Fuel Coffee;Good coffee. Didn't like the way it was shipped though.
5;Cat owners can save money.;This is exactly the same product that is available for cats, only in a larger package, larger bite size, and MUCH cheaper cost per ounce.  Get these and a knife, your cat will be happy as will your wallet.
5;Works best for cramming;Cramming doesn't really help with your exam grades anyway..
5;City Ham;I am amazed at how fast this City Ham diappeared! Excellent product, with a great flavor, hot or cold. Price is a little higher than a store bought ham, but well worth the home delivery and lean, trimmed texture and the spiral cut is a blessing to portion at the table.
5;Love it!;My five finicky guys, (dogs), love this treat.  I save the crumbs to sprinkle on their food.
5;Great Tea;A well flavored Tea for after dinner or to use when you have trouble sleeping. I have purchaced this enjoyable tea twice from amazon.
5;Great Product!!;I love this product! if you really want to take out sugar from your diet for good this is the one..
4;A mixed review;I've had two of these products. The large one was great, my dog Rocco had fun figuring out how to get the food out and became quite a pro at it.
5;That's what I am talking about!;This K-cup saved my K-cup maker from extinction. I was used to dark, strong brewed coffee and none of the K-cups I tried up to this one could provide that.
5;All animals love it;This is the best for all the animals.  The dogs love it to.
4;Good enought to drink just for the taste;Many protein drinks need to be choked down. They taste like chalk mixed with syrup.
5;Very good;I've only found this in powder form and have tried it in my coffee both with and without sugar. Either way, this is a great creamer.
5;Shhhhh...it's a surprise!;I recently had the set of Apple Blossom Amaryllis' shipped to my aunt, and when the flowers started to bloom, she was speechless.  The colors were so gorgeous that she ordered more to have an entire room filled with them.
4;Incredible food!;We recently found that our cat has an allergy to chicken so we went on a search for a food that was equal in quality to the ones she was use to.  Our first attempt at a replacement was lamb and brought catastrophic results.
5;Good So Far!;I got this for my wife for Christmas.  She planted the herbs on Christmas day, and they are doing great.
5;Great stuff;I love this stuff. It has really helped me with a lot of things.
1;These Made My Lab Sick;I ordered these after using the other C.E.
5;Great flavor, great kick!;After eating at a couple of Nando's restaurants on a recent trip to South Africa, I just had to bring some of this sauce home with me.  It's got a tangy flavor that is great on chicken, roasted potatoes, or even just mixed in with some rice.
5;Delicious!;"I ordered this cake for my brother and his wife. Here's their thank you letter:<br /><br />""The upside down cake arrived today, right side up"
5;Sweet Juicy Raisins;Raisins are sweeter and juicier than those in Kellogg's raisin bran (seems like less sugar on them, too).  (You also don't have to support a company that dumps an olympic swimmer for minding his own business and enjoying some recreational chemicals.
3;Candy Vitamins;It's difficult to remember, eating these, that they're supposed to be vitamin supplements.  As other reviews have already said, they're small hard candies.
1;Buy to make croutons or bread crumbs....;Being recently diagnoised with celiac and being a bread lover, I am constantly trying out the gluten free breads. This loaf bread was a major disappointment.
5;Just what I expected!;These are exactly what you might expect if you bought at the store. I was pleased with the product and they made great party favors at my son's 3rd birthday party.
5;Great Deal, I love these bars;Great price using Amazon's subscription service.  The bars are a satisfying snack when I hike or bike even at work.
3;not a true soymilk drinker;i'm not one of those people that love stuff knowing it's good for you. it has to taste fairly ok at least, but when this soymilk is cold(it has to be cold for me to like it) it hits the spot-especially if you're hungry and you need a quick fix.
5;Delicious and Healthier!;I am a bariatric patient, and these are wonderful on the go snacks for me. In moderation, if course.
5;new to rooibos tea;I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did.
5;CS Chai is the Best!;For some reason, the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea is hard for me to find. I have tried about 5 other brands, including all the major and some regional tea brands, and nothing else compares to this blend.
5;Fresh;Wasn't the 3lb, but ordered scrod/cod in a smaller size from Fisherman's Fleet. The product impressed me by smelling really fresh.
5;Delicious Crepes;These are delicious pre-made crepes that you can use in your recipes instead of taking time to make your own crepes.  These are easy to use especially if you need a large quantity of crepes.
5;one of the best;lowest fat 1.5gms/serving - still tastes great!<br />this flavor bit spicy, but not too much - is awesome.
5;She looks like such a sweet old lady on the bottle.;In reality Mrs. Renfro is a mean old biddy than wants to burn your o-ring out.
5;Eat, Smile, Eat;Great standalone snack or addition to yogurt. Cocoa flavor is solid but without a candy taste.
3;Love Larabars, but this is not the best flavor;We love Larabars, tried some new flavors this week, and the Blueberry is pretty bland. I'd choose other flavors over this one next time.
5;This is a great product!;This food is better than I expected. I am a long time user of Sojorner Farms (SoJo's) no grain vegetable mix until they obviously changed their recipe (tho' their retailers say they have not) into a bag full of powder instead of vegetables.
5;beefy mushroom;I have enjoyed this product for many, many years.  I was terribly disappointed when I discovered it was no longer available in any store.
5;Excellent Alternative;I grew up on cafe au lait's from Cafe du Monde.  Now I can't get enough of my vietnamese coffee.
3;Greenies;I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.
1;Very disappointing burnt/bitter flavor;My girlfriend and I picked up a box of these from Costco, and had high hopes that they'd be delicious, natural crackers.  We are very open-minded about natural foods and most of the stuff we eat is very healthy and natural.
5;Great for everyday needs!;This was orignally purchased because I use it for a scalp conditioner, as well for my hair. This product can be used cooking, but I like using the extra virgin organic coconut oil (not necessarily the same brand) for cooking because it gives off a coconut taste into dishes that make the dish really come to life, comparable to coconut milk, but need less ingredient for the flavor.
5;Superb Tea;This flavor of Honest Tea is one of the best, which leads to it always being sold out in my local Whole Foods or Wegmans.  I was surprised when I saw it up on Amazon, but then when you look at the price, that is a bit ridiculous.
5;It  Works!;Finally, a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. You feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level.
3;OK but other brands are better;The flavor was okay though for my taste it was a bit too sweet, much more so than with similar products from Crystal Light and Propel.  And the other brands have less of an aftertaste.
4;Good but some packages were missing;ordered the 4-12 packs. 2 of the 4 boxes only had 11 packs.
5;Great Instant Coffee;I love the flavor of this instant coffee. While the regular Taster's Choice coffee is very strong and bitter, the Hazelnut is smooth and flavorful.
5;Very popular with my cats;These treats come in small (cat) packages and large (dog) packages.  I save money by buying the dog size for my 5 rescued cats and breaking up the larger pieces.
2;Marley Coffee Pods;I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended.
5;black truffle oil;I looked at a lot of different truffle oils and this one came from a manufacturer that makes a lot of related items.  It tastes great and it is a good value.
3;It's good once you doctor it up a little bit!;I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both.
5;One of my favorite snack foods;As someone with many food sensitivities and allergies, I am excited when I can find a gluten-free, low calorie snack.  These rice bars are healthy and full of flavor.
5;Yummy, yummy Mocha mix!;I first got this in Ridgeway, CO., driving 40 minutes each way to get a mocha made with this<br />mix.
5;Delicious;These are my go to snack! I really like the convenience of dried fruit. I also like the pricing for bulk orders like this.
5;Worth a brew or two!;I am a coffee lover. Many will not enjoy these bold flavors, but Raven's Brew coffees are exceptional.
5;Belgian Pearl Sugar;We fell in love with Gaufre Liege during our first trip to Belgium. Since then we have had to wait until a subsequent trip or until family members could send us some pearled sugar.
4;Dog Tested;I have two large dogs and a relative budget.  So this maybe terrible of me, but I don't mind a little filler.
5;pantry pest trap;works better than expected.  Took a couple days before anything happened, but now both traps are full of more moths than I thought existed.
5;Great pick-me-up!;I have always liked to have this product on hand.  Sometimes I am not really hungry and this fills the bill, and kids like it, too.
1;Buy Something Else;I bought this food for my already sick cat and he hated it so much he lost 2 more pounds and refused to eat it. This is coming from a cat who'll eat almost anything including spaghetti, yogurt, oatmeal and lettuce.
5;UMMMM!!!!!!;I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past.
4;smooth hemp shake, chocolate light flavor;The Nutiva hemp shakes have the best texture around for sure and that is appreciated! But the chocolate one doesn't taste like much of anything.  I expect a chocolate mix to taste like.
5;Nylabone edible beef wolf size;The product was exactly as described.  Wolf is Healthy Edible's code for large.
4;I love this stuff;I brought some of this home with me form Europe last summer and I love it. When I saw it for sale on amazon I had to order a few cases.
5;Great popcorn;I bought a poper from Discount Tommy a few years back, and have ordered and used there popcorn since. It pops easily and completely every time.
5;this cereal is really great!;Nature's Path Honey'd corn flakes are really great tasting and healthy (only a few simple ingredients) and gluten free too. I highly recommend this cereal.
3;Fruity;A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty.
3;Nothing To Write Home About;On a scale of one to ten, Maxwell House being a one and Gevalia being a ten this coffee tastes somewhere around three or maybe four at best. It claims to be a gourmet coffee but it sure doesn't taste that way to me.
5;Great deal;PG Tips loose leaf tea is my favorite black tea. It's strong and hearty.
4;our cat ate it;Our cat liked this.  It took her a while to get used to it.
5;Delicious!;I enjoy drinking hot tea during the day.  I drink this tea without any sweeteners and it tastes good.
5;PIll pockets foe my dog.;These are the best things that I have ever found to use to give dogs pills. Great idea.
3;Not as remembered-but still tastes good;while the flavor is remains the same, i notice that the color of the crackers is different than when i first purchased these crackers from a local retailer back in 2006. Back the, the crackers had the same coloring as the image on the box.
1;AWFULL-DISAPPOINTED-MORE LIKE CRANBERRY;I emailed the following to Ocean Spray:<br /><br />*Blueberry Juice Cocktail<br />The new Blueberry Juice Coctail does NOT taste like Blueberry at ALL!!<br />Your add & label are misleading.  This is more like cranberry juice with a splash of blueberry.
5;Fruity Pebbles Cereal;I saw this as a great deal on cereal that beat my local grocery store. It's Fruity Pebbles, the same taste but in bulk! Great taste, awesome price, you can't go wrong.
5;Delicious;Made my first batch of hummus yesterday. Tastes great.
5;Excellent blend;This is the perfect balance of mint and green tea. It needs no sweetener - it's mild anda refreshing.
5;Wonderful Earl Grey Tea;I have been caffeine free for a year now and I do appreciate products that are truly caffiene-free (rather than low-caffeine). This tea is as caffeine free as they come, and it has a wonderful flavor -- unlike any other Earl Grey I have tried.
3;not that different from regular 5 hour;this has more caffiene and 2000 mg of energy blend..
1;Not again;Product is good..
1;Disappointed product;The shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent. I was just very disappointed in the product itself.
5;Can't find Senseo coffee, here's the story;Years ago Philips and Douwe Egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods.  The copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only
1;Light roast not Regular!!!!!;This is NOT the regular roast Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee that came along with your Keurig Coffee maker, but a much lighter roast. The picture is misleading and shows the k cup that matches the regular roast.
4;"Five out of six cats say ""Yummy!""";"Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except ""Mr. Picky!""  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like ""people food,"" as the box says."
3;Meh...;"Got this when they had a promotion on it and although it's not really bad it's not that great either.  I guess if you like that ""burnt"" bean taste (a little akin to Starbucks roasts) then you may actually enjoy this."
5;Jas loves food in general ;
4;very happy with purchase;I ordered 2 cases and only a few of the cans had very small dents in them.  I'm very pleased with this item.
5;Love It!;I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog.
5;very good;I felt it was very good but not great. I recently purchased a similar product from The Spice and Tea Exchange in Tarpon Springs, FL.
2;Not a bold coffee;This product is not bold in flavor at all. The package is different than what was pictured on the website.
5;Better than Raman, a nice change! I add fresh ingredients though;I always have Raman around, especially my favorite MAMA noodles (reviewed earlier!) from Walmart!  But these Udon noodles are such a nice change when you want a fatter, more noodley noodle! They cook up super quickly, just like raman, but I think they taste a whole lot better with some fresh green onion tossed in during the last moments of cooking. Or add some soy sauce.
5;Best tuna I've ever had;I discovered this tuna at my local health food store in CA and loved the taste, it actually has more tuna and way less water than most of the commercially available brands. It is a little expensive but I always find myself buying this brand again when I stray to another brand.
5;Great quality popcorn;"Tiny But Mighty Popcorn or ""TBM"" is the best popcorn I have ever had. Being adventurous I've tried all sorts of Popcorn, kettle-corn, cheddar, butter, sugar, even marshmallow popcorn."
4;Good product;This is instant cappuccino.  It is pretty tastey.
5;Good coffee alternative!;This is the best coffee alternative that I have found so far. I love a hot cup of coffee but due to the negative effects on my health I had to find a substitute.
5;Great Maple Syrup;Better than the medium or dark amber grades, also would be a great gift.  Go ahead and try it.
5;Chocolate glazed donut coffee??  Count me happy!;I was pretty excited to try this flavor and was NOT disappointed!  It smells heavenly when brewing and tastes like a good cup of coffee with the perfect hint of a chocolate glazed donut aftertaste!  I could close my eyes and believe I was in a donut shop, drinking a great cup of joe.  I think, like most of the flavored K-Cups I've tried, the flavors are more of a delicious smell than taste but that is just perfect for me.
4;Not All Great Dark Chocolate Bars Hail From Europe;I've always been a fan of Newman's Own products and this dark chocolate bar did not dissapoint. I like my dark chocolate bars to have a bit more cocoa (70% at least) but for those who shy away from the bitter flavor, this bar offers a good balance with a hint of sweetness the higher cocoa bars lack.
1;Inedible and hard as a rock...literally!;I would normally give anyone (the seller in this case, not the maker) the benefit of the doubt on products, but these were awful!  They had to have been several years old at least!  The caramels were hard as a rock and inedible.  Unfortunately, I had already given a bag (they came pre-bagged) as a gift before I tried them.
5;If you like a strong tasty cup of tea...;I first discovered this tea at Starbucks..
5;Ghost pepper salsa, finally i dont have to upgrade my own.;This salsa has some decent amount of ghost pepper. You can tell it apart from the rest by the slow onset lingering pain in the mouth.
5;awesome;I brought this product b/c the FOB my husband is at in Afghanistan doesnt have monster and he loves them so much mine does but i couldnt ship to him from my FOB so i searched and this was the best deal it didnt take very long to get out here to him. none of the cans were damaged in shipping everything was great.
5;Allen's comments;I was a limited tea drinker until our purchase of our Keurig Coffee Brewer and the Green Mountain Sweet Peach Black Tea. I now have one com a day of the peach or of the sweet lemon.
1;Expired Product;I bought this product on September 2010 and this product expires on the 27th of August 2010. I have bought alot of products with amazon and until now I had no problems.
5;Outstanding;These teas are wonderful! Couldn't recommend them more.<br /><br />I was introduced to these teas in Portland, OR by my sister.
4;Christopher Ranch...;This is a good brand. I got one container of this then looked around and now I purchase one pound garlic bags by CR and add balsamic vinegar and spices and get the healthy and delicious garlic from US.
2;Arrived melted/stuck together;The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.
5;Best olive oil I've found for the money;Good quality oil.  Even with shipping, still cheapest price for the quality compared to whats available local stores.
1;We WERE addicted to it! Now it SUCKS!;This is my original review:<br />My super picky daughters and husband love this, finally a natural supplement! The pediatrician had been telling me to supplement my skinny girls with pedicure, but I refused. We love it!<br /><br />This is how we feel now: wtf?<br /><br />I also ordered from vitamin shoppe because amazon was out.
5;Outstanding Value!;After my wife paid about $7 for a can of McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, I knew there had to be a better value and Angelina's fits the bill perfectly.  The color and granularity of the two products are identical and I can't tell a difference of flavor, either.
4;Great Deal - Better Than Most;For the price, I'll drink it all summer as iced tea. It's the best deal around.
4;New conditioner by Unilever;This conditioner comes in a very handy packaging.  The bottle has flat base on the botton that can be easily opened to extract conditioner.
5;I'D GIVE THIS TEN STARTS IF I COULD!!!!;Nothing short of HEAVENLY.  I've even made fried rice using this and my whole family loved it.
4;very good product;"I had tried Weruva flavors with veggies in them and my cats either wouldn't eat as much of the bowl, would eat around them or kick the peas around the room!  This one and the ""paw lickin chicken"" were preferred by them.  There are huge chunks of fish in here that make you feel like you're opening it for yourself."
2;Yuck!;I love the concept of the Sodastream, but the Cola flavor could be better, even more so when they try to compare it to Pepsi. I know with non-brands there will always be a difference, but this flavor is not good.
4;Small box soymilk;I purchase these when available, hence the good review.  Especially like the small size to drink at once or to daily use as coffee creamer.
5;Dog treats;This is an excellent treat for dogs.  Our dog loves them and it is a healthy alternative to some other chewies.
5;Very nice gourmet sea salt!;This salt has a great flavor.  It is a little coarser than I expected and is slow to dissolve, but it give a nice salty burst of flavor with just a hint of something more.
4;Great herb tea;If you are trying to reduce caffeine in your diet, and you drink a lot of tea, this tea is for you! It has a robust flavor very similar to black teas and has no caffeine. We started out by using half rooibos and half black pekoe to test the taste.
5;love this;This is great in tea, ice tea, coffee and ice coffee. Nothing artificial and very tasty.
3;NOT Original;Ovaltine was a product that had large grains..
5;GOOD STUFF;I GAVE THESE AS XMAS PRESENTS BECAUSE I LOVE THE NAME, BUT PEOPLE REPORT ITS A FINE CHUTNEY. THE BOTTLES ARE A GENEROUS SIZE, AND EVERY ONE I ORDERED ARRIVED INTACT.
1;Did Nothing;I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened.
5;Sophie's Treats;This is one product that my welsh terrier can eat. Sophie has food alergies so I have to be very careful in what I feed her.
4;BPA no longer an issue;****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.
5;These things freaking ROCK!;Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.
5;My cat's favorite flavor!;Unlike one of the previous reviewers, this is one of my cat's absolute favorite variety. He usually will just lick the can clean while my other cat eats the food, but this is one he truly enjoys eating.
2;Cats aren't fond of it;"Has a light brown color, ""mousse"" type texture, and my two rather non picky cats will eat about one bite of it.<br /><br />Fortunately we have four dogs to take up the slack."
2;Costco;If you have a Costco card buy it there, this is a ripoff. At Costco you get three 1/2 gallons for about $7-10, about 1/4 of this price for the same amount of beverage.
5;Delicious;Don't let the lower price fool you.  This stuff is easily as good as other brands of greek coffee.
5;Quick and Yummy;I'm addicted to these! They're basically like a raw candy bar. I like them because the ingredients are healthy and they don't contain agave syrup.
5;Good stuff...Hearty.;I use this in my greek yogurt (Fagee) with organic honey for breakfast. This stuff is awesome.
5;Love all the flavors;Fantastic package of different flavors for my Keurig Brewer.<br />I enjoy a variety and it is fun to sample a different cup of coffee every day.
5;WOW;I actually ended up buying this from walmart because I was in need of an oil free moisturizer for my face..
4;Good Bold Taste;I've had Dark Magic, Starbucks Pike's Place, and Starbucks Sumatra.  Out of the three, I prefer the Dark Magic, especially given the price.
5;Yummy;Really delicious. Love having it in the fridge as an alternative to ketchup on potatoes, rice, even Mac & Cheese.
5;Absolutely the best bagged tea!;This is the best coffee replacement offered in a bag.  It is a great wake up cup of tea.
3;Used to taste better;I ate these as a child and there were a lot more peanuts in them then. I still enjoy them but bet they's sell a lot more if they hadn't cheapened them up.
5;Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee K-Cups Coffee;Always delicious and satisfying..
4;Flavorful, but not the real thing;First impression is to wonder just what the point is for the Moctail line of flavors, are we supposed to use them as drink mix and add alcohol or are they meant as yet another flavor. Either way you save some calories with these zero calorie drink mixes.
5;Great help to stop constipation;I have been suffering from chronic constipation my whole life. Four to nine days of misery was my regular life.
4;good, cheaper option;I'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff.<br /><br />This IS the KRAFT cheese powder! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags.
5;Seeds that Sprout!;The germination ratio of the seeds was great-- about 85 - 95%.<br />I was also pleased with the packaging and timely shipping.
5;RICH SMOOTH FLAVOR I LOVE IT!;I bought an espresso machine a few years ago and wanted to find the right coffee for me.  I read up and researched the reviews and found that Lavazza is #1 in Italy.
5;Best Cookie ever!;I got one of these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox! OMG they were so good, My daughter and I shared the first one then i went and got another box! This are a must have now! They are great to snack on. They are super soft.
5;Morning Comfort;My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but.
4;It's supposed to be a good product;I have read all the benefits of maca, and love th idea of using it. I used to add it to my morning smoothies.
5;Lingonberry Preserves;This is great for your health.<br />Animal studies have shown how the lingonberry can lower inflammatory molecules, block oxidants from destroying tissue, and also help the body replace important antioxidants, like glutathione, which is a master antioxidant in our body.
5;Everything is as it should be;I ordered these nuts..
5;SOFT AND SWEET;A yummy brownie like cookie that ships well. Good price and got amazons super saver shipping.
5;Peaceful and soothing;I love this product and I share it with my family and co-workers.  JVS by way of Amazon is the best there is for online purchase and I will definitely continue to buy from them.
4;Lecker !!!;This is a great sweet mustard, it was delicious.the shipping was fast, the quality great.
5;Healthy & Delicious Potato Chips;Oh, these chips are wonderful. They are not greasy, have a very satisfying crunch and although they are formed chips, they taste like actual potato chips.
5;Love these chips;Madhouse munchies are great potato chips. They are even healthier than most chips but taste great.
4;Personally I liked it, but won't go out of my way to buy it;I tried this product through Amazon Vine, as have many other reviewers here.  Personally, I liked the flavor .
3;1 down 47 to go;Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.
5;Great kitty food;My two kitties differ on many of their food preferences, and we are also mindful of their health and so we try to limit their fish intake.  So, we are grateful that we found the wellness turkey recipe.
4;Acquired taste;At first I was put off by the smell and wasn't quite sure what to do with them. On their own, I am not a fan.
5;Good stuff;I have two Maine Coon cats.  One loves it the other is more fussy and prefers the smaller size dry food.
5;Excellent Dog Food;I feed this to my two 6 month old golden retrievers.  I tried numerous other foods that they were just not interested in (eukanuba most recently).
4;Good, clean cocoa powder;"I think they call it ""cacao"" as opposed to ""cocoa"" when it's less processed and more pure or something.."
1;Dried. Not Fresh.Product has been inconsitent.;I love these things. They are easy and you get a good amount of lean protein.
5;Excellent matcha!;I enjoy a heaping spoon (included) of this every day in a mango-banana smoothie. It's everything I expected--fresh-tasting, nicely packaged (looks good enough to leave out on the counter), and reasonably-priced for the twin-pack at $41 from Amazon, or $37 (missed this when I was searching) from Pier Mall.
2;The Price Is Not Right!;A box of 5 for 9.99?<br />What happened to the case of 5 boxes for 37.
5;Pinoy Fiesta Lye Water;This is a quality food product manufactured from soda ash using the leaching process, unlike others that use the sodium hydroxide and water formula. This product far exceeds other lye waters for culinary use and does not crystallize or cloud.
5;Yum!  Dogs love 'em!;This is a great product.  Just a tiny treat tid bit that dogs seem to love but keeps them from packing on lots of calories.
4;great snack;Very tasty jerky.  More moist than other brands, and the only one I've found that's gluten free.
5;Only place I can find this product;The cereal is great.<br />I just can't find it in any local stores.
5;Super Smoker's Tennessee Flovored Bar B Q Sauce;"This is the GREATEST Bar-B-Q sauce!!  I found this in St Louis when we were visiting our daughter 3-4 years ago, and have become ""hooked"" on the stuff!  It's better than any other sauce we've tried anywhere!!  I stock up with 5-6 bottles every few months.."
5;A very nice surprise;"I purchased this order so that I could make home-made soap for the holidays. I hesitated because of the price but yet I wanted a organic ""quality"" home-made soap so I clicked the buy button."
5;Yummy!!!!!;I received a free sample of these last week and I ate them that day.  They were absolutely delicious!  I hope I can find some good sales at my local store, we eat a lot of cereal at our house.
2;Is the sour coating really necessary?;I have been using Nordic Naturals products for years, way before I got pregnant with my son - so when it was time to choose a vitamin for him, I went straight to the Nordic Berries.  Unfortunately, the sour coating made them completely unpalatable for our child.
5;Gift;It's gift for my princess.It tastes good and  baby love it.
5;Kettle Chips;We were very pleased to find that Kettle Chips were available on [..
5;Lab Loves It!;My lab loves these treats. If you are looking for a healthy treat at a good price for your dog, give these a try.
5;Measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee;I have been drinking Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee for a bout a week.  I find it pleasant, complex, and fills the kitchen with a very pleasant smell.
5;fruit slices;My father loves fruit slices.  As he is 83, and I wanted to get him something really tasty.
5;We make a lot of taco's, so...;This is a great product! No more hunting down the isle and find the taco packets each time.<br /><br />More flexible - use as much or as little as you want to spice it up to your liking.
5;C'est bon-bon?;"Mid 1960's 10 year old earthling encounters tangerine flavoured ""Bon Bon Napoleons.""  Life is good!<br /><br />45 years later I have to order 7 pounds of the bloody things."
5;DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ONE;THE TORANI DRINK FLAVORING SYRUPS ARE AWESOME IN SODA, COFFEE, ETC. ALSO ON ICE CREAM,AND APPLESAUCE.
5;FINALLY a soda without deadly chemicals and high fructose corn syrup;Anyone who has done any research knows that equal, splenda, and H.F.
5;it's all in the preparation...;Here's how to get the best results:<br /><br />1. Open the package and dump into a sieve and run under very cold water for at least 60 seconds to rinse away seafood aroma.
4;Good puppy food;My dog loves this puppy food! We select Orijen puppy food after reading reviews online and it didn't disappoint. So far, my dog has not had any problems with it.
5;Great Product;My mother and I love the chocolate twizzlers but they are hard to find.  I ordered them from Amazon and received the product in a timely manner and the licorice was very fresh.
5;Great Seeds!;They are the best seeds I've found. Nice and fresh! Plus, you can't beat the price.
5;Excellent;I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Teeccino as an alternative to coffee and this is it.  Tastes more like coffee and costs a lot less.
1;reformulation is terrible;I've been taking these for over a year, and possibly my chol. has been lowered a little, but who knows really?  I hate taking them, but the alternative is statins.
4;Good But Pricey;Seems like a good product however the price is prohibitive for regular use. I would recommend persons use it only under special circumstances like a long automobile trip for a lift and safety.
5;Great northern popcorn;Best popcorn ever!  Just like at the movies. Love how the popcorn an salt are separate so you can add or subtract to desired amount.
5;great;Can't find these in the store anymore and glad I can get these online with you. The snack mix has sunflower nuts, raisins, pumpkin seeds, cashews, and almonds.
5;good stuff;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Fiber One Cereal;Fiber One cereal is high in fiber. It has 14g's of fiber.
5;Great product.;This is a great product, and it is extremely palatable.  It is usually used as a travel food because it is easy to travel with and even dogs who don't eat while traveling will eat this.
3;Its.....OK.;Its not bad but i'm not too crazy about it. I've tried to make it different ways but its just not great.
5;Taste good at a good bargain;I read reviews before I bought and tasted a sample in my variety pack. Very good taste.
3;Mocha Cappuccino;The instant Mocha Cappuccino is quick to use, but not quite what I was looking for. As with almost all products, it is very sweet and only comes in a pack of three.
5;Excellent Excellent Excellent;I ground these with the Messerschmidt grain mill attachment for my Kitchen Aid (no oiliness issue) and I couldn't be happier with the results.  Our poppy seed rolls were some of the best we've ever baked.
1;Boston baked beans;Upon recieving order, Boston Baked Beans were immediately thrown in the trash. It may be a personal preferrence but, they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.
1;M I S L A B E L E D......( H I D D E N  ---  L A B E L L E D )......T E A ?????;I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour.
5;Only need a few drops;My mother gave me this to try.  It is wonderful!  You only need three or four drops to sweeten a tall glass of iced tea.
5;Scary name for good coffee.;When you offer it to someone, they might freak on the name.  But it has a great taste.
5;This is an awesome product;I only cook with this coconut oil.  It's wonderful and adds a delightful taste to veges.
2;bad beef;I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them.
4;Good Tasting Granola Bars;Most health bars taste awful.  Fiber One Granola Bars Oats & Caramel is not bad at all.
4;"Great ""on the go"" healthy snack....";Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.
5;really nice treats;My dogs really enjoy this treat..
5;Great food, and perfect sized cans.;I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.
5;A nice cheese, fun to eat.;This cheese is nice, friendly to the palette. It has a nutty flavor, like aged Swiss cheese, and a the tang of sharp cheddar.
4;cooks, chefs, and diners;These Amish products are very good and economical.  I find them, used appropriately, very helpful in cooking.
5;Check the Contents;This is a safe, nutritional food for cats.  My cat vomits frequently, and we have changed cat food over and over.
3;Cereal;Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal ..
5;I am VERY Picky About Texture;I have heightened sensitivity to touch/texture. It can make enjoying food a little difficult sometimes unless the texture is JUST RIGHT.
5;Amish Butter - yum, yum!;I first tried it in a now defunct specialty supermarket in the Pittsburgh area and was instantly hooked. The only butter that comes close to it in flavor is Cabot butter (no longer sold at retail) or imported Irish butter.
5;Best Place to Buy;I have a bad case of dry mouth due to the medications I take. I can use a special toothpaste, mouthwash, and mouth spray, but those only help for short periods.
5;Coconut oil rocks;Coconut oil (extra-virgin organic) has become the only oil I will use for cooking. It gives food a tropical kick of flavor & aroma, but not overpoweringly so.
4;Hard to find;I used to enjoy Joyva Halva when I was a kid. We had neighbors that always seemed to have food that I'd never heard of.
1;Not really available;The one star is for Nuticity's advertisement of a product that apparently does not exist.  Knotts Berry Farm used to produce the best strawberry preserves at a reasonable price.
4;Yum!;This is a very tasty nutrition bar. It has 160 calories, 2 grams of fat, 20 mg of sodium, 3 grams of protein, and 22 grams of sugar.
5;Truffles to die for!;These truffles are absolutely decadent! I am coming back for more after already ordering 5 boxes. After tasting them, I am going to hand them out at Christmas to everyone I know.
4;Honest Brew;"Stash have tried very hard to get quality product for the consumers. The tea comes fairly close to the best on the market -  this is quite an endorsement from an Indian palate who has nearly 30 years of twice daily Darjeeling tea drinking ""experience""."
4;Very different flavor, but good!;First off, lemme say that I've been eating sunflower seeds for over half my life. I've had pretty much every brand & flavor out there.
5;If you can't drink coffee, drink roastaroma!;Let me preface this review by saying that I never used coffee primarily as a CNS stimulant. I always favored caffeinated coffee because it tastes better.
5;Pepperiffic !!;The Durkee Spices really are great. The crushed red pepper has an almost roasted aroma and taste.
4;I'm no fan of concentrated juice drinks, but in Ribena's case, I make an exception!;Ribena is one of those childhood staples that I MUST have. I miss the little juice packs that you can get in the UK as well as the carbonated variety that comes in cans, but you really can't beat the old-skool bottled concentrate.
5;I love this stuff.;Red Star has a great flavor and can be easily added to many food.  It is great for a cheesy, vegan flavor.
5;A unique condiment that will transform your rice;With a few shakes of this magical Japanese seasoning power, my okay rice transforms into a delicious, savory and filling dish.<br /><br />I recommend sprinkling on a bowl of short grain brown rice.
5;Awesome Waffles!;This packaged mix is by far the best product for making waffles that I have ever purchased and I've tried them all! If you like a good malt flavored waffle that is crisp on the outside and moist and soft on the inside, you can't go wrong with this product. I give is 6 stars out of 5.
1;horrible taste & stinky;i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place.
3;Contains MSG;This soup contains MSG.  The only canned soups made by Progresso that are free of MSG: Green Split Pea, Pasta E.
1;Beware!;Be aware of the quantity you're ordering! When I ordered, this was offered as a pack of 6. Only one was delivered to me, and when I called Amazon, they kindly rush-shipped the replacement (I only asked for 5, but they said they would send 6) the next day.
5;Awesome!;I was very satisfied with this product.  Twelve packages of Creme Savers!  Too bad it had to be discontinued.
5;Everything good!;This food has been really good for my dogs!  Their hair is softer and shinier, their eyes are clearer and their energy is better.  Even though this is much more expensive than the food I had been giving them I find it a bargain because after more than a year I see a profound difference in their appearance and health.
5;Bold Smooth Flavor;I tried this coffee hoping I would like it and it turned out I loved the bold flavor. I drink my coffee straight black and look for a strong bold smooth flavor and this coffee hits the mark.
5;great product;Had been buying greenies at the pet store for the past 7 years, best price on sale was $32.99.
5;ABSOLUTE LIFESAVERS!!!;Recently one of my elderly cats was diagnosed with an ulcerated cornea that had both bacterial and fungal activity in it
5;The kids love it, so they drink their milk + it adds vitamins;I don't add as much as the directions call for, but it tastes good so that everyone gets their calcium. I like to add it to a half-full gallon container of milk so that it's even easier to drink, plus it seems even better when you can shake it up just before drinking it - frothy like a shake and well dissolved.
3;Too sweet for me;The Kind bars are just too sweet for me. But I love the fruit and nut ratio and crunch with every bite.
5;Nice & crunchy mixed with canned food;My dog has been eating this b4 I bought her from breeder, so I'm keeping her on it. I mix it with a good canned food & she loves it.
5;Stash Organic Assam Tea;Stash Organic Assam Tea is my regular everyday tea. Rich and smooth, I can brew it easily by the cup or by the pot.
5;Delicious!;This is the most delicious milk.  It tastes like drinking the best vanilla pudding you ever had, but not too sweet.
1;Not for Me;I did not like these at all.  The price is too high in my opinion, too.
5;Rare Balsamic Vinegar;Although this is expensive, this is the real deal. Just a couple of drops on fresh berries, etc.
4;Decent rub for more than just the birds.;A handful of people have all commented that this rub is actually quite good on pork steaks and chops, and not just on chicken. It's a decent bulk buy, and it's salt free, so you can control the salinity of the season while still using a ready mix.
5;Amazon order;Yummy twizzlers our favorite red licorice twists all 180 count of them. Great gift to send off to a kid at college too.
5;very good coffee;If you're hooked on illy, as my wife and I are, this appears to be the cheapest way to obtain it: ~$33.33/kg.
5;Delicious!;Obviously, these things are not a healthy breakfast choice, but they sure are delicious. I really didn't get them as a breakfast food, but more as a guilty pleasure.
5;Based on beef being grass fed however . . .;the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone.
5;Super Hot.;Unless you got for artificial this is as hot as it gets.  Great stuff buy this if you want the heat.
5;I have to agree with Wulfstan's review and these are mighty tasty;I'd also go with Mountain House for pilot crackers which could be used for survival food. Since we had a situation where a family member was trapped in an unexpected blizzard, I think these might be worth keeping in the trunk of a car.
1;Great product, but look for a better price elsewhere;My 10-month old loves these! They are helpful to teach him how to eat and relieve pain from teething, too. Look around for a better price: I was able to find a great deal at my local BJ's club: a mixed 6-pack for $9.
5;Love it.;I had this for the first time two days ago.  It may take a tiny bit of getting used to, but it is a wonderful cereal.
5;Pura Vida!;This is the best coffee. I may be partial because I grew up drinking this and can't live without it.
5;YUM -- Just like they make it;This stuff is really good. I picked up a box at my local grocery store (they also make salted caramel and toasted marshmallow but I haven't tried them).
5;Clean, invigorating, fresh-tasting tea!;I never was much of a fan of tea until about five or so years ago, when I started seeing the value it offers beyond being something to soothe your stomach when you're sick, or something hot to drink that's put on your table at a nice Chinese restaurant. And, honestly, that's exactly how I thought of green tea, especially, up until recently: it was just a substitute for water in a nice Chinese restaurant.
5;Happy!;My dog loves Greenies! Read some reviews about it online and tried it out since Amazon Prime shipping is free, the price was affordable, and my dog refuses to have his teeth brushed. I've been giving him 1 per day for a few days now and it's like a treat to him! I'm satisfied.
5;AMY'S LOW SODIUM PEA SOUP;I ordered the following Amy's Low Salt Products: Lentil Soup, Pea Soup, Minestrone Soup, and Medium Chili.  All of them are great.
5;My children love these!;They taste great and are healthy. We keep our home stocked with Nana's Cookie Bars.
4;Great Coffee;I think this is a really great Hazelnut coffee.  I have tried the Green Mountain and the Gloria Jeans K-Cups and I think this one has more flavor.
5;Great Cereal;This is a great cereal.  It's somewhat similar to Captain Crunch but isn't as hard on your mouth when eating.
2;packaging ugh!;OK..
4;It's not red licorice;I've read several reviews complaining about this product not being like the red twists they're used to, but though one might expect that taste based upon the appearance, they are supposed to be different.  I, too, expected a different taste when I took my first bite, but after the surprise.
3;Beware;The flavors are good, however, the pops come off the sticks.  Fortunately I know the Heimlich maneuver because my 5 year old was choking on one that came off almost whole.
1;These are terrible;I was so excited to get these.  I figure they would taste along the lines of the dehydrated strawberries you find in cereal.
3;'Clear' conditioner has heavy perfume smell, but conditions OK;Beautiful hair starts with healthy hair. Although I've been very happy with Pantene for some time, I was very interested when I saw CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner.
5;Genuine Chocolate- BEST!;I love animals. This is so far the BEST flavor- milk chocolate with cherries! Yum! The wrappers have interesting, eye-opening stories.
5;I have made the switch.;I am not a vegan but a regular weight lifter.  Even my fellow lifters have commented how bigger I have gotten in the last few months.
5;Cookies excellent;The cookiea arrived on time, and were exactly as advertised.  They were delicious.
5;You can have good coffee even you are having just one cup;You may not be grinding the beans, but even if you are having just one cup of coffee you can have a good one. I was impressed by the nice aroma and taste of this fair-trade coffee.
4;it is a good product;I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it.
3;K cups;Tastes great, although not priced very well.  Needs to be less than .
5;Smooth;This coffee has a really great taste asnd if very smooth.  It isn't very strong so I do add a spoon or two extra to my normal amount of coffee grounds.
3;Finicky;"Two of my kitties ate and enjoyed the turkey pate, but my finicky kitty wouldn't even go beyond a sniff and a ""no way"".."
5;excellent!;I am happy to report that Maxwell House Decaf won a taste test on Americas Test Kitchen! After I saw that I thought I'd give it a try. I have never liked decaf, but this is really good! This is a good price, too, as the decaf is higher in my store.
3;hmmm;took about 3 weeks to receive this order.  cost about $5 for shipping, but it's just taped to a piece of bubble wrap, put in a small manilla envelope with a standard .
2;Edible;I bought these on special when they were only about $13 for 24 .8 oz bags.
5;Economical and great quality;I started eating bulgur instead of rice and this was a great deal. The bulgur is great quality and delicious.
3;"Not ""everlasting""";I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd
5;My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet;"NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka ""Boost Bites"") provides a little treat for my cat, that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice, chicken meal, corn meal, animal fat, animal liver, malt, artificial flavors, brewers yeast, and a chemistry lab of various preservatives, and artificial colors."
2;Poor packaging, damaged cans;Packing was not appropriate. The cardboard box was torn in several places.
5;Best Brown Rice Ever;I wrote this review for the 15lb bag of this product but wanted to share this here for those who would prefer to purchase less or in the convenient packages.<br /><br />I love brown rice and for years have purchased a variety of rice products from organic growers.
1;Save Your Money;I thought this was the answer to our mosquito problems.  NOT!!!!<br /><br />I followed the directions and made sure I soaked everything with this stuff: Grass, Bushes, Plants, etc.
5;Yummy;Want good flavored, tasty ice cream.  Add a teaspoon or two of this stuff for super ice cream!  Experiment with it to see what suits you best.
4;Good chocolate;Ordered this chocolate for a party we were having.  Taste was great and texture smooth.
5;Cet HEXtra chews;Received in timely manner.  Excellent product.
5;Great taste!;This newton product is a good adaptation of a cracker. The fruit is in the product but, it is thin and chewy! My 3 year old enjoyed it also.
1;Very disappointed !!!;I can not wait to try this so called 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  It costs more than other Blue Mountains Coffee - over 50 per pound.
5;Loved It;I thought this was delicious and rich. Although, when we make it, we open one pod and dump it into the cup, then run another pod on the 8 oz setting.
5;Great!;This item arrived pretty quick- ordered on Monday and arrived on Thursday.  The packaging was secure and it arrived in great shape.
3;Good cookies, but....;Be careful what you order along with these cookies. We made the mistake of getting a 5 pound bag of Gummi Bears at the same time.
5;Eagle Pack Anchovy;Papillon doggies love this food. Obviously great flavor, super ingredients, and a smaller kibble.
4;Great item, new container design flawed.;Our 2 year old goes through a 7.05-ounce container in 2 days as this is the recommended meal per his nutritionist and he absolutely loves it.
5;Great stuff;I love this stuff. It has really helped me with a lot of things.
5;Great K-Cup value and taste;As usual, the service was great and the product exactly as expected. Bought this for my Mom since she loves Pike Place at the Starbucks and she enjoys this k-cup product equally as well.
4;Tasty;Not the sweetest chickpeas I've ever had, but close enough. Nice flavor and texture, very fresh, no old beans.
5;My dogs love them!;Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July.
5;Good stuff;Bought these for my mom, who eats them (and the regular Nutri-Grain Bars) every morning. Needless to say, she loves them.
5;Our Dogs LOVE These and We Do Too!;I have been feeding our dogs Greenie bones since they first came out and we have NEVER had a problem.  I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.
1;Robin C;I ordered this item, and I ended up wasting $12.00 because they were terrible.
5;Exhilaration is a good description;Great tea. Love the packaging.
5;Great for Tea;These honeystix are perfect for hot tea. Just the right amount of sweetness.
5;Wow;Brutal stuff, but still edible.  The salsa itself is a bit tangy, average taste for a salsa, but you won't care about that after a couple of minutes anyway, because your face will be melting off.
3;Pleasant taste but too sugary for me.;I don't use sugar in my coffee or tea and this product has sugar in it. It is way too sugary for me but otherwise had a pleasant coffee taste, not bitter and very smooth to drink.
5;My favorite sweetener!!!;I have tried quite a few sweeteners and landed on Sweet Leaf stevia as my preferred choice.  Then, on Amazon, I discovered the SUGAR LEAF stevia/cane sugar blend and was hooked.
5;Remind me of...;Being a kid. I love these candies but often cannot find them where I currently live.
5;Does the Job;QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.
4;Volumizes, but might fade color?;First, a note about packaging for this shampoo.  It arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and inside that, the shampoo bottle was tightly taped inside a plastic bag.
2;salt and vinegar chips;It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again.
5;Sunkist Fruit Gems;Excellent and timely service. I received the product quickly and packaged nicely.
4;B&M Baked Beans;These were a regular staple in our house years ago and then it became difficult to find them in stores.  Was very happy to find them available on Amazon.
5;Awesome Grill Brush!;Does a wonderful job with the sauces and cleaning is very easy. Nice bent design makes it easier to apply sauces to the items towards the rear of the grill without burning yourself on the warming tray above.
4;very good, but not special, smoked salmon;This is very good smoked salmon for the price, but, for my tastes, I have bought better. I like smoked salmon dry and solid, but this salmon was extremely moist and fell apart easily.
3;Could be better- very strong tea!;I like to drink herbal tea every once in a while as a break from coffee.  I love Mint Medley tea bags, but it doesn't work so well in k-cup form.
3;Less Flavor;Good popcorn, bad Kettle Corn flavoring.  Some bags taste ok, but others have no kettle corn taste.
5;Love these!;I love this brand of chips. By far, I like the cheddar potato the best.
2;Newman's Own Organic Liver for dogs.;I am not happy with the Organic Liver for dogs.  It is too mushy and should be mixed with dry food.
1;Nothing Special Here;Nothing special here. It's just hyped up water.
1;This is NOT smoked salt!;This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again.
5;great figs great company;"I just got my second order of these figs.  They are absolutely great--moist, tasty,<br />and with zero ""bad"" (dried out, over-fermented, etc."
5;Taste good!;The thing with rubs is if they don't taste good out of the bottle, well don't use it.  Most rubs arn't much more than cheap spice and lots of salt.
5;Coocoo for Coconut Oil!;Great product!  I use it for cooking and in my smoothies.  The flavor is wonderful, and it always seems to bring out the natural flavors of meat and seafood.
1;Don't bother, you'd get more flavor from pureed lettuce;Some few years ago, I'd use Thai Kitchen sauces and pastes and they tasted pretty good. It's a bit hard here to get lemongrass and other Thai ingredients other than fish sauce.
4;Tales of a Coffee Snob;"I'm what I refer to as a ""middle-level"" coffee snob"
5;YUM!;I tried the original flavor and loved them!  Can't wait to try the Caesar flavor.  Calories aren't too bad, the serving size is decent, pretty low in sodium as far as crispy snacks go and 5g of protein.
3;Item shipped smaller than what is pictured;These are genuine Kasugai wasabi peas which are quite good, but the packages they shipped me are 3.06 oz instead of the 4.
5;Addictive Bread;I first bought this bread at Whole Foods and loved it.  Then, they had a problem with their supplier and week after week had no bread.
3;Just hot;This is an ok hot sauce. I read the ingredients and thought it would add a bit of sweet to help balance the hotness.
5;Couldn't be happier with Arctic Zero!;I just got my delivery yesterday (6 pints Choc. Peanut Butter, 6 pints Vanilla Maple) and I've already polished off a pint of this Chocolate PB- it's THAT GOOD.
5;Delicious and very healthy;Im not a big fan of extra strong dark chocolate, but the health benefits are many so I figured I would try a few of them out. This is by far the best one.
5;Get rid of the crystal light - this is so much better!;This is a unique powdered product. It is unsweetened and turns water a brilliant green.
5;Finally, a Healthy and Tasty Chip!;Sometimes you want sweet, sometimes you want salty. When you want salty, consider trying these chips.
5;Great Soup!;My daughter loves noodle soups.  Since going gluten free, we have been without the convenience of canned soups for her.
4;Works well but too dense;"My dog likes to chew it but it's ""heavy weight"" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch."
5;Awesome!  Full and rich flavor.;No watered down decaf here.  Excellent aroma.
2;Tasty but with a big drawback;Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.
1;Disappointing;I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.<br /><br />This is what I found:<br /><br />- In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.
5;Love this coffee.;My family loves this coffee. I enjoy the rich flavor and aroma.
5;I Love this Tea!!!;I discovered this tea on my first trip to England, about 15 years ago.  I love it with raw sugar and cream.
5;Great RAW food energy bar;"Most of the ""Energy"" bars found in supermarkets are so full of refined sugars and processed ingredients that they're hard to digest and actually slow you down. These are full of raw, high-net-gain ingredients, so the body can digest them easily and get that energy you need and/or really curb hunger between meals."
2;I got rocks pebbles from these boxes of black beans;The quality of the box content is crappy.  I don't know if they are doing this on purpose or not but I found a few rock pebbles in the boxes together with the beans.
3;Not for me!;I didn't like the taste of this stuff when squirted int either plain or soda water.  I suspect the energy comes from the caffeine used in the juice.
5;Favorite Fall drink;I have purchased this from Amazon for many years.<br />Best price and I like having the extras available, have shared with friends, too<br />This summer I made this and then frozen into a slush that was wonderful<br />The calories saved are a bonus.
5;quite good!;yum!<br />for all those fans of black liq.<br />yuck!<br />for all those tasteless fools who hate black liq.
5;Delicious!;These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.
5;Death Rain;This is an excellent bag of chips!  I bought two cases and shared them with the folks at work.  Everyone is raving about level of heat.
5;incredible;I have always enjoyed peanut butter but always stayed away because of all the fat.  Since I began using this product I look forward to having more each time.
5;Excellent Value;This is a better value than the Quinoa I previous purchased at Trader Joes.  Being on a low carb diet, I needed to maximize the value of every carb, and this is about as good as it gets.
5;My Favorite Tea;I drink this tea every morning and have it on automatic order for a box of six packages every month.  I do find that I have to steep it just a little longer in order to get the pretty redish pomegranate color and flavor to come through.
2;Taste terrible.;A great example of what not to freeze dry.  This barely edible product can still be used to demonstrate how hard it is to design good Astronaut food.
5;Where has this stuff been all my life ? ?;I cannot say how sorry I am that after 45 years of pie making, that I only discovered Clear Jel® this year. I consider myself a good cook, and my pie-making skills top notch, but I've had my fair share of pies turn out soupy or way too stiff with whatever I chose to thicken the filling with - flour, cornstarch, tapioca flour, arrowroot and others.
5;Excellent quality food at an excellent price.;Canidae is an excellent food that is meat based and is great for people who are looking for a top quality dog food, but don't want to break the bank. I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods.
5;good;This product comes fast enough and allow my mom to make her cakes more favorable. The price is little higher than I thought.
1;Literally Stink;I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.
5;The 13 Healthiest Snack Foods By Details Magazine;"I came across a review by Details Magazine last night: "" Pumpkin Chips<br />Pumpkins are higher in beta- and alpha- carotene than almost any other food, and recent studies have found that those who eat the most orange foods live longer. These thick-cut pumpkin slices are the perfect longevity snack."
5;These Cookies are great!!!!!!!;I love these cookies. They aren't grainy and are really moiste and tasty! They are easy to make and enjoy.
5;Emeril's Big and Easy;If you enjoy a bold but mellow cup of coffee, then this is the one for you.  I enjoy Starbuck coffee but this is even better.
5;Great Product;I've been using this product for several months, and it works very well. Since I only use half the recommended dose, I use half the amount of hot water recommended to dissolve it.
5;great taste...replaces sweetner in everything;taste is great! i use it in all my recipes that call for a sweetner, my coffee, pancakes..
1;DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.;I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days.
5;Helped with my baby's food allergies;I love this oatmeal. My baby had dairy allergies so that I had to eliminate all milk products from my diet while I was nursing him.
5;The best!;I absolutely love this stuff!  My Dad used to give us each a can (or two) for Christmas every year, and it was always a favorite.  I've never been able to find it where I live now, I should of known to check Amazon! By the way, I've never tasted a variety I didn't like, but I've never tried the reduced fat kind, either.
3;steep for 1.5 minutes and it's not bad;Steep for 3 minutes and it tastes ghastly. I just tried at one and a half minutes though and it tastes much better.
5;Yummy fun for toddlers;My 16 month old daughter loves goldfish at her daycare. I wanted to buy some at home, but grocery stores usually only have big packs.
2;Tannic and bitter overpower the sweet;I am glad for the chestnut growers that the bees are there to pollinate their trees, but I cannot say I like the resulting honey. The tannin and bitterness of this honey, not its power, are what I dislike (I like a manuka, which has quite a powerful, rich breadth of flavors).
5;Tasty!;Despite what others are saying about these teas, they are DELICIOUS! It is the perfect amount of sweetness. The Peach ones are my favorite.
1;Deceptive Advertising;
5;Much more interesting that rice as a base for a meal;We love Kashi but often cook it in either chicken or vegetable stock instead of water.<br /><br />A favourite of mine is sauted chicken breasts, served on a bed of Kashi surrounded by baby spinach leaves tossed in sesame oil and fresh ground pepper.
1;J. W.;This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.
5;Fantastic ! Best baked potato chip ever.;These potato chips are absolutely the best baked potato chip I have ever tried.  They are so good that my husband and son will also eat them.
1;The Salt & Pepper version is awful!;We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.
5;YUM!! Great work, bees!!!;Wow this is THE best honey I have ever tasted, and I've been a honey freak since I was a little kid.<br /><br />Midly granulated, it spreads nicely over toast, try it on pancakes, is great in tea, I even tried some on top of my rice pudding -- excellent!! Maybe I should try sweetening my coffee with this.
2;Still undecided;These candies have a good taste and they seem to be made from natural ingredients which is nice but they had a slightly stale texture, sort of chewy.  I bought them for the office and had several people taste them and agree.
5;Perfect pod maker;Tried out the Perfect Pod Maker this week.  The directions don't really say how tight you should pack the pod with coffee or the type of grind.
1;Way Too Much Sugar;I always get excited whenever I see organicly made candy. Candy you wouldn't feel guilty eating or giving to children.
5;Great food for all cats!;According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.
5;Best commercial coffee, ever;I found Carte Noire in France in 1993 and started bringing packages back with me three or four times each year.  What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica
5;Yummmm;We have used Tom Douglas' rubs for years now.  I first found them at a winery on the east side of Washington state.
5;Great gift idea;I bought several of these for family members for Christmas. They were the most liked and appreciated presents of the season.
5;Really great protein bar;I unfortunately work in a job setting where we do not just get to take breaks when we feel like it or snack while working. This can be a problem for me, as I tend to get hungry every two hours and sometimes only get a 10 minute break.
5;Way better then Jax;I brought these a few times honestly and I even saw the Jax  on sale cheaper. Yes Jaxs are bigger and look tempting but thats all they are.
1;Something's wrong with this coffee;These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste.
4;1 out of 8 did not like these;I've purchased 4 boxes of Bobo's Oat Bars in the Chocolate variety from Amazon in the past month.  An acquaintance had told me how delicious they were, so I took a chance and purchased my first box before I embarked on a trip, planning to take some along for the journey.
5;My Favorite Bar of All;I saw this amazing combination in a healthy bar at Starbucks.  I am a mango fanatic so ANYTHING with mangoes rule!  I was not disappointed!  Mangoes, Macadamia nuts and coconut in 1 bar?  Heaven!  I turned on several of my co-workers to these and plus they have folate and calcuim, which were not in the bars prior.
5;Pretty darn good;This stuff is actually really good. Has a very Alfredo-esque flavor, with some black pepper hint.
1;Ghastly;That word sums it up, but I'll add two more:  bland and bricklike. The nicest thing I can say about this bread is that it has a decent crust when it first comes out of the oven.
5;Gin Gins the Powerful Little Treat;"These little treats pack a powerful punch.  The ""peppery"" taste is just the beginning."
5;Petite Cuisine Red Snapper;When I first purchased this product I wasn't sure my cats would like it.  However, I quickly discovered that they do.
5;Makes Great Cotton Candy!;If you purchase a cotton candy maker for home you MUST purchase Cotton Candy Express candy sugar. The flavors are great and the floss sugar makes making cotton candy SO much easier.
5;Time for tea!;This tea is lovely for a refreshing iced tea, a comforting hot tea or mixed into a light Sangria.  'Hard to find, but worth the effort.
5;Delicious!!!!;Totally DEEEEElicious!!!  Love Flipz.  Especially from Amazon.
4;great for cooking too;though this salt is ideally as finishing salt, but i use it for marinating chinese dishes and its still fab, esp on fish and seafood dishes which enhances the unique favor of seafoods itself.<br /><br />Paying a bit more can definitely see the difference!  will keep using it.
5;Great nutrition that kittens love!;Even after being a vegetarian for over a decade now, this food actually smelled and looked pretty good -- especially considering that it's canned cat food.  Unfortunately, I think my kittens may be eating better than I am now.
5;YUUUMMMMYY;I received a pouch of this as a gift and made it for my family one day -- it is so delicious and everyone loved it.  And then, of course, they wanted me to make it again.
5;Yum!;These are delicious! Both of my gluten free kids love them. My only complaint is that they are a little expensive.
5;Awesome Pho;I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this.
5;Surprisingly excellent;I've been subscribing to Newman's organic raisins, but I decided to try these, as they are a less expensive. I prefer these raisins now.
5;Great product;I have tried many different brands of coconut oil, and my kids like this the best, I found even better price on iherb.com, use LOV684 to get $5 off your first order.
4;Healthy treat?;"It's a pretty big bag- it'll probably last me a while since I don't give out treats too often. Little meaty bits look tasty and less ""processed"" than the grocery brands, which I really like."
5;I love Jet Fuel!;When I invite my family and friends a cup of coffee, they always ask for more, even when they are not heavy coffee drinkers.  They all like Jet Fuel as much as I do.
2;Not good enough;I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs.
5;Great for what I needed it for!;I use this for my breakfast shakes in the morning.  It adds peanut taste and protein without the fat!  I have also hydrated it and had it on toast and it is pretty good but I do miss the oil consistency a little bit.
1;What a waste of money!;This is my first review ever.  After seeing the price charged, I felt I had to let people know what to expect for their $39.
2;Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor!;I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that..
4;good tasting;It was hard for me to find good tasting whole bean decaf coffee.  This coffee works for me.
1;no longer tasty;I hadn't had a whatchamacallit in a few years but there was a time when it was tasty. The manufacturer has changed the recipe and there is no longer any taste of peanut butter, the caramel flavor is gone too and of course, Americans haven't had access to real chocolate flavor in years.
5;Sweet;Came quickly.<br /><br />I used it for the first time in baking and it has a nice sweet flavor.
3;Too Strong;I ordered light roast coffee and was sent one box of light roast and one box of extra bold.  I didn't notice the error until I had used a couple of the extra bold pods.
4;Pretty nice;The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.
5;Pop Chips are great;Popchips are great. I got the barbeque in the single serving, 100 calorie size.
5;Can't do coffee;Red Bull is an acquired taste.  But when you get used to it it works better than coffee to keep your alert and energetic.
5;Slippery Stuff;Recommended by a Physical Therapist and Urology Nurse Practitioner. Non-greasy, a little goes a long way.
1;Ridiculously, immorally expensive dog treat;I could not believe my eyes when the dog treats arrived.  I had not checked how much my $12 would buy, but there was 3 oz!!!!  That brings the price per pound to over $60.
1;Undrinkable;Wow, this stuff is nasty. I'm glad I only ordered one box.
5;A Surprisingly Refreshing Gift!;I received this as a gift from the company and, of course, immediately sniffed and tasted it.<br /><br />A friend of ours gave us a soda stream machine because he was tired of it.
5;Great product;"This tuna product gives any tuna recipe a ""kick"" that takes away the same-old taste of tuna. I use a can of this mix per each packet of regular tuna for tuna salads and casseroles."
1;False advertising;I agree with Paul.  I had a sick cat and was looking for a deal online.
5;great heat and great pour spout on top;Not only does this sauce have a great taste. But they have a small enough pour spout on top to allow you to pour small drops on your food, if your careful, or pour a lot.
4;Satisified;My wife is very happy with this product. She takes it , I do not.
5;Good quality pug food, best price anywhere;My pug is thriving on Pug 25, and the price here is so much better than buying at my local pet megastore..
1;Disappointed;"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being ""thick"".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot."
5;Candy;Received this purchased boxed of 5lbs of candy within just a few days or ordering it on-line.<br />The price was exceptional compared to THE VERMONT STORE.
5;Small is HUGE - but Pomeranians loved it!;My husband and I were shocked at how large this bone was!  It was full of peanut butter and my two Pomeranians loved it!  They weren't able to carry it around because it is too large.  They had to sit on the bed and lick at the peanut butter center.
1;1 star;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great quality Raspberry Leaf;I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception.
5;Great for frozen mochas;My wife loves this.  Here is our recipe:<br />In a blender we add<br />1 Cup skim milk<br />1 Cup Ice<br />3 rounded teaspoons Cafe D'Vita SF Mocha mix<br />1 oz cofee liquor<br /><br />Great stuff.
5;Gingerbread House Kit is a Big Success with Grandkids!;Reasonably priced, excellent quality merchandise as you usually provide.  Speed in delivery, no problem with availability of product or delivery.
5;Perfect;Fast shipping and great taste. i would recommend this to any one, i love this cereal yum.
5;Healthy Eating for your Pet;This food is the best.  My dog has been eating Blue Buffalo for 4 of his 5 years.
5;My favorite;I tried Millstone Coffee about 5 years ago and I've been hooked every since. The best coffee that I've ever had.
5;Intense Tart flavor with great nutrition - Kopali is best brand of goldenberry;"I love the powerful tart punch of Goldenberry as well as their great nutrition.  These are much more flavorful and moist the <a href=""http://www."
3;Tart and refreshing if...;I've had time to go through most of the case of this product, and I give it a slightly positive overall review.  The pros: small size can holds just the right amount of this different beveridge, and fits easily in the hand
5;Great Salsa;Enjoying it, first had in Seattle at family home.  Not too spicy, goes with a variety of food types.
5;Oh yes.  This is the stuff!;Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, two 10-Ounce Packages.  Arrived today and this is what I was after.
5;It's not pasta night without it.;I honestly can eat this on its own with a little sea salt and olive oil. Cooks super fast so anyone who's thinking of using it make sure you're watching it, it takes 3 minutes tops to cook.
1;Coffee Pods Do Not Work;Purchased two boxes of these coffee pods and have used 10 of the 48.  The pods do not work correctly in my Keurig.
2;Gave my cat loose stools;I was excited to find this at my local pet store for my cat who has allergies.  Her allergies would cause her to scratch at her head and ears until she had sores that would become infected.
5;Toothsaver;My elderly Pomeranian LOVES these Senior Greenies (even more than regular greenies) and absolutely never lets us forget this 4 o'clock daily treat (I never have been able to fully understand how dogs tell time, but we all know they are VERY good at it--and surprisingly accurate).<br /><br />These are a little bit softer than regular greenies & they contain both chondroitin (sp?) and glucosamine for joint support.
5;Great stuff! Has multiple uses!;I bought this recently to add to my homemade laundry detergent powder so I could eliminate the need for a vinegar rinse. I love making my own detergent
5;Treats for Food Issues Dog;My dog cannot have any food with grains that include corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice (brown and white). The only meat he can tolerate is lamb.
4;FIJI Water 16.9 ounce bottle review;I had seen FIJI water around before and never thought much of it. I always felt that water was water and thought it was all made the same and tasted the same.
4;My dog loves these treats!!;I have a golden retriever who loves these treats and they are a good chewing alternative since she has started having some anxiety when left alone.  They last longer when placed in the treat balls but it can be a pain to get them into the ball so I have given them outside the ball as well.
5;Great for winter !;I love a cup of Hot Choc. in the cold winter months.
5;No doubt, it's nifty;I did not read the reviews about this carousel until after I purchased it, so I was rather dubious by the time it arrived at my house. However, sice placing it into operation, I have found it to be mechanically sound as well as an astetically pleasing addition to my kitchen countertop.
5;Loved these;Really tasty. Unusual and good flavor.
5;Good K Cup Coffee;Green mountain makes pretty good coffee, this is my favorite out of the lineup. I usually have a couple of these a day while im at work love em.
5;Great Rub for Pork and Chicken;I have made my own rubs for a long time and have tried dozens to get different flavor profiles. Once I tasted this rub, the search was over.
3;MORE APPROPRIATE NAME WOULD BE 30 MINUS 1 K-KUP;I was excited to place my order in hopes of getting exactly what I ordered, however I received 29 k-kups rather than the advertised 30 k-kups.  This was disappointing as the missing k-kup was a hot chocolate for when my niece comes to visit.
4;"Great ""Soft baked"" texture.";"The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear ""it thru the grapevine""."
4;Good Product;Not necessarily heavy duty but seems like a good product.  Happy with it as it serves purpose of being able to leave the door open for a few minutes and keeping the bugs, etc out.
5;Delicious;We couldn't have been more pleased with this purchase. The shrimp was well packed and arrived perfectly frozen.
5;Great Bread;I used this to make bread in my bread machine.  At last a gluten-free loaf of bread that does not crumble!  This bread is more like wheat bread than any other mix or recipe that I have tried.
2;Great texture, bad taste.;It is interesting to me how many great reviews this product got, as I was not satisfied much.  Granted, this is the first gluten-free bread I have made, so I do not have any gluten-free breads to compare it to, but compared to regular wheat bread it is bizarre, and it taste nothing like the homemade bread I am used to.
3;Unsure of the flavor;I was sold on this product as it was Organic and Raw, it's pretty good, smells great.<br /><br />I have only used it in a few raw food recipes such as ice cream, but I can almost taste an aftertaste which I can't pin point exactly if it's the oil, but I have only noticed it when using this oil in my recipes.
1;Bad Batch?;I had high hopes for these fruit leathers as my daughter loves them.  When we received them in the mail and I opened the box they were all a very brown color, they look nothing like the red color in the picture shown.
5;Twinings English Breakfast black tea;Twinings never disappoints. Of all the higher end black teas, I prefer Twinings and Tazo.
4;Smooth, but not very vanilla;I don't drink coffee often, but when I do it must be mild to medium roast and very smooooth.  I don't like bold roasts or most flavored coffees.
5;happy;I love these packs. They are delicious and easy to throw in a diaper bag or my kids lunch in the morning.
5;Great Food;I love this food and so do my dogs! High quality and great nutritional value is what first attracted me to it and my dogs love it too. I have always fed my pups high quality dog food so I can't say that their coats look better or that they have more energy than before I was feeding this brand but I can say that they are healthy and do have beautiful coats and a ton of energy :)<br /><br />Taste of the Wild just came out with a canned version of this item which I just recently tried and was VERY impressed with.
1;Pucker up, these mussels taste sharp!;The sauce these mussels are in is awful.  It is very ascerbic (tangy/bitter).
5;Favorite Breakfast!;I also have this for breakfast every morning.  When I first started eating it, it seemed bland compared to the normal variety, but now the normal variety seems way too sweet.
1;Worse than worthless;A complete waste. Cost was $51.
5;Good for you .;"I sprout these using an <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Delicious snack;These are about $1.50 to $2.
5;GREAT CEREAL;This cereal is very hard to find!  Glad that I was able to order it on amazon.com.
5;Fantastic Pet Food!;I purchased Dancing Cat after speaking with a friend who had been using their Laughing Dog Brave Dog Formula for her dog. My rescue cat had experienced several bouts of weight loss and lethargy and the vet could not determine what was causing it.
4;Nice change of pace;Do you love hamburgers? Do you feel guilty about the fat and cholesterol of beef patties? Here's a suggestion--try bison burgers.<br /><br />More and more farmers are raising bison for their meat.
1;$5.66 for a can of beans..lol .. don't think so.;I was curiose to see how much it was actualy be to buy from amazon v. the local grocery retailor.
1;0 Stars isn't an option;These are SO cute.  I really wanted this to work with my new potato bag from Orka.
5;One of the Best Mild K-cups Made;I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.
4;SEA SALT SOMERSAULTS;I received these to give my unbiased opinion.  I liked the amount of crunchiness and the flavor of the nuttiness of the crackers,but they were a bit too salty for my taste.
5;amazing!....;I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey.
5;Undergebrg bitters;Fast delivery! Thank you. I've always been curious about those tiny paper-wrapped bottles and, upon reading Parsons's Bitters, was encouraged to try.
5;Dog Treats;My dogs love these treats.  They beg for them and sometimes I sprinkle these treats on top of their food for a special treat.
5;Robert's American Gourmet Smart Puffs;This is tasty snack food.  Would definitely purchase again.
5;Very very good coffee;"I had never of this source but the reviews (positive) are right and this coffee is a ""keeper"". The coffee is bold are really a ""kick a__"" blend at a good price for K-cup coffee."
5;AWESOME gift for bartenders, chefs, and bakers;My mom got me this set as a stocking-stuffer for me and it's the best gift ever!! These oils are incredible.<br /><br />I fancy myself a home bartender and like mixing up different drinks.
5;Highly Recommended!;Innova Evo Cat and Kitten food is one of the best wet foods on the market without question. Both of my cats love the taste of this product.
5;Pricing;I can not understand the change in pricing in 30 days. My first purchase of 60 tabs was 34.
5;Best Tastin;This is the best tasting sugar free shortbread cookie ever. Doesn't even taste sugar free.
4;Great Popcorn!;We bought this popcorn to go with a machine we had purchased, and the machine ended up not working.  So we took these portion packs of popcorn and used them on the stove top.
5;Husband Stealing My GF Cereal!!;I was diagnosed with an allergy to gluten a little over a year ago and it has been challenging and frustrating to find a tasty cereal, most are very bland and I ended up adding my own nuts, fruit etc. to them.
5;MY 18-MONTH OLD MALTY-POO LOVES THIS;I've had my malty-poo, Chloe since she was 5-weeks (don't get me started on that..
5;One of the best Chipotle sauces I have tasted;I saw this at my local grocer one day and bought it on a whim.  I did not hold out high hopes but this stuff gave me a very pleasant surprise!<br /><br />The smoky flavor of chipotles is the main star in this sauce of course, and has a lovely tangy/sweet balance.
5;Great product;I bought this to use for canning blueberry pie filling. It works great!! Will definately be using this for all of my pie fillings from now on.
5;CALM Plus Calcium is great!;Only way I have found to take Calcium without nausea.  It has also helped me to sleep better at night.
4;Great Taste and Value;This Pure Natural Bar, Peanut and Raisin Crunch, is a tasty and fulfilling bang for your buck. The 2 key components to making this bar a treat you'll want to eat are the ingredients and the taste.
4;Tasty;I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.
5;The best herbal mint tea;I drink lots of mint tea in the evening, helps calm my digestion. I've tried many, and this one's the best.
4;VERY FRESH PEANUTS THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO BUY THEM;IN A NUTSHELL: EACH PACKAGE CONTAINED 2 OZ. OF FRESH PEANUTS OR CASHEWS<br /><br />These 2 oz.
5;Great taste.;This tastes great.  I love peanut butter, but not all the fat.
5;Blue Diamond Almonds Habanero BBQ;I love the product, they have great taste, easy to order and we did not have a long wait time to recieve them. I will order again.
2;My golden won't touch these treats;These treats may be great for some dogs, but my golden did not like the taste.  I had hoped to use them as small training treats (such as the BilJac liver treats), but she would have nothing to do with either the peanut butter or the salmon flavor.
5;Love this Gadget;I like the natural nut butters, and I store them in the fridge.  Didn't want to microwave them, tho, so I now store them upside down, set the jar in warm water for a bit and crank away.
5;keep these in your pantry;I keep these in my pantry at all times. They make a great quick lunch.
5;Great!;We have a black female lab. And since she was little she would not eat anything but pedigree and as long as shd was fine we gave it to her.
1;Buyer Beware if sensitive to ingredients Maltitol, Sorbitol, Mannitol!;This gum has Maltitol in it which can cause gastric distress to people sensitive to this ingredient.  It also has Mannitol and Sorbitol, these are all within the first 4 ingredients of the gum!  Be careful if you are sensitive to these sweetener replacements.
5;Yogi Egyptian Licorice Tea;My daughter & I both love licorice tea.  This particular tea has a wonderful strong black licorice flavor, we often drink it after meals as a spicy-sweet, no calorie dessert! It does carry a warning not to use if pregnant or nursing.
5;Overpriced Teddie;as a former resident of massachusetts & city of everett employee, where teddie was roasted, & even in the dead of winter where its delightful aroma wafted lazily over its surroundings, i was delighted to note that amazon is offering teddie peanut butter for sale. but why,oh why is amazon making it so pricey? in the most select of new york city's premium grocery stores, similar pound bottles of peanut butter, such as smuckers (i.
3;Extra Energy? Where?;As a new mom, I could use some extra energy and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for me. One of the pros is that it has lots of B vitamins in it with no sugar, carbs, or calories so you can use it even when dieting and it's not unhealthy for you like all those sugared up energy drinks like Red Bull.
5;Awesome gift....;My daughter-in-law bought this tea at Heathrow airport on her first visit to England.  She loves the strawberry tea.
3;The seeds that do not grow.;"I bought these seeds and am experienced at growing gardens.  Only a handful of seeds germinated and of those two managed to grow into plants that I have ""babied."
4;Pretzel sticks;This has become a favorite go-to snack for my husband.  Has a wonderful bite of heat.
1;Not so sure because;I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst
5;Great afternoon snack!;This makes a quick, low calorie, low fat savory snack. I emailed the company and they verified it was vegetarian, which makes it one of the few options for an instant soup I have.
5;Yum-o!;I really liked these cherries.  They are sweet-- but not too sweet.
5;Green Energy;I have tried a couple of different yerba mate teas and this is by far my favorite. It consists only of freshly dried yerba mate leaves and nothing else-no additives, no artifical or natural sweeteners.
4;Fresh and flavorful;I am very pleased with the Bergin (Roasted, No Salt) Sunflower seeds.  They've got a nice flavor and really, you don't miss the salt.
4;Great price Quick shipping;This company is a pleasure to deal with. Customer Service was a joy.
5;Great Product !!!;This powder truly is super !! I drink it alone with soy milk or add to a smoothie. Amazon has the best price, and if you have it delivered monthly you save even more.
5;Coconut water;I absolutely love this coconut water. Amazing taste 100% pure.
5;Great poptarts;I discovered these poptarts quite by accident.  And since my family really loves all things pumpkin and ginderbread, I ordered them.
4;Delicious;I know this coconut water is from concentrate but I still really like the taste.  Something about it really appeals to me and I can't quite figure out what, other than perhaps it's not as sweet as some other brands.
5;A delicious 'tonic-like' tea;I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.
5;Wonderful stuff;I am so pleased with this product, my cut flowers don't wilt and now last for weeks. I have large red roses that are 2 weeks old with no drooping heads or browning.
5;Excellent product;I was advised to use this power bar in my diet and I can't believe how good it is! I have tried many brands and I do have to say this is one of the best I ever tried. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
5;Delicious;We love Quinoa but it is hard to find where we live.  Just make sure to rinse them extremely well - especially if using for the baby.
5;Great stuff!;I've been using this product for the past few months and I've seen a difference in my health. It makes me more calm in stressful situations and it keeps me regular.
5;My sons FAVORITE!;My son has celiac disease and gluten free food just isnt that good. These, however, are GREAT! He uses these in place of a sandwich for his school lunches and LOVES them.
3;What I noticed was the smell;I'm sorry
5;Quite tasty!;I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.
5;I love these shells!;These shells are delicious!  And so easy to prepare.<br /><br />One of the big problems in my GF life is how long it takes to get/make foods that taste like the 'real' thing.
3;Tastes good but not sure what to do with powdered granola.;Pros: I appreciate that these grains are healthy and high in fiber.  It's also good that they are all natural, gluten-free, without GMO.
5;best millet yet!;I use cooked millet to supplement a special diet for my dogs.  This stuff looked so good I didn't hesitate to taste it myself and was surprised to find it had a pleasant taste & texture.
5;Priced Right and Palatable;First let me say that I wish I could tolerate apple juices that taste more like cider.  I can't
5;This is Good Stuff!;I've always liked tomato-based sauces on my foods. Ketchup, seafood cocktail sauce, chile sauce and salsa are all in my cabinets.
5;Energy for mornings at the gym;This bread is our favorite breakfast for workout mornings.  We each have one slice topped with peanut butter and sliced banana.
5;Just love this stuff;I use Royal Blend as the only rice product here in the house.  I love the nutty flavor.
2;Dry. No matter how it was prepared, dry, course, lumpy, clumpy;Very dry, difficult to find that happy-place with this product.<br />I grew up in a Greek restaurant, I know food.
3;Nice, but a little too much licorice;I made a cup of this tea using a 1/2 tsp of honey and steeped it mildly (light yellow color). The first half of the cup was very nice, although I didn't taste much ginger.
4;Excellent papers.;Excellent papers. Very thin but strong.
5;Tastes like old fashioned popcorn;I am delighted with my new Pop's corn.  I eat a bag of popcorn just about every day at work because it's only 2 weight watcher's points and it takes a long time to eat, and is relatively healthy.
3;It's okay but too sweet and a little gelatinous;I have been able to find a few uses for this product, mostly to make a very sweet cup of hot cocoa but as much as I love sweets even I can only drink one mug.  Also, there is something in the powder that renders the resulting liquid sort of thick, more like gelatinous.
2;Only flavor I did not like at all;I like all of the flavors to a degree, except this one.  It's really salty and the combination of flavors isn't good.
5;Very Satisfied with this dog food;Our dog kept shedding really bad so we switched to this food and it has basically stopped her shedding!  We love the price of it since we have a large dog and go thru a bag a month.  We will recommend this dog food to others.
5;Licoricaliscious;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great!;This is great for use as a base for gravy, soups, pot roast. I'm so happy to have found it here, as it can be hard to find in grocery stores.
5;Don't tell mom we know her secret;Im from western PA and everytime I go home to visit my family I stop at Primanti Brothers and Delallos. Bout time you get some more of their products on here cause  shipping with my family or their site is killing me.
5;Excellent product;Sunbutter has become the new grocery staple for me.  I developed a peanut allergy at the age of 25, having eaten peanut butter al my life.
5;Best dog treats;I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way.
5;Great dog food... A little expensive;Ingredient wise..
5;Sensational  not-too-sweet cookies;They're somewhat fragile and almost too big to consume in a single bite (I'm a full-grown man) but the flavor and texture are terrific, sweet without being too sweet, crunchy and chewy at the same time. Really good.
4;Wolfgang's Hazlenut;"This one is my wife's favorite of all the Hazlenut blends she has tried. This is her ""go to"" after a busy day of being retired."
5;great for dogs with grain allergies;Rescued Pom/Chi mix Mr. Peanut seems to have allergies to all grains except oats.
5;Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt;Have used this salt for many many years and everyone just loves it.  Also put it in gift baskets for friends and family.
5;vita coco;The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar.
3;Lackluster  pseudo-Indian tea;My friend shared Indian tea with me, which was THE  BEST, smooth, quickly brewing tea, I have ever had. This lacks what I expected.
5;Excellent service and product;The transaction was effortless and the delivery was exactly as promised. The Loma Linda Swiss Stakes are delicious, with really tasty gravy.
5;Best tea I've found.;I'm a former coffee drinker and I'm always looking for that cup of tea that will satisfy my craving for something dark and roasty.  The tea itself brews up dark, and the slight chocolate essence makes it a richer cup.
5;True Boysenberry Flavor - The Best Fruit There Is;You know, I've been blessed to live in regions where I was able to have all kinds of wonderful fresh fruits, even very exotic varieties.  And of course I've had non-local fruits, including obscure faddish ones.
5;A staple in my house;Now, this is a cheapo sauce - kinda like cheapo wine I would drink with every dinner. So don't expect crazy and exciting bursts of flavor here! However, it gets 5 stars from me for the combination of the solid flavor profile (earthy, subtly umami, not at all sweet, easy on salt) and the incredible price.
3;Ok after some tweeking;Our family loves the kraft velveeta cheese noodles so I thought this would be a hit.  Well not so much.
5;Delicious and Healthy;During a recent trip to Ireland, I got to try Muesli.  I had no idea what it was when I first had it, but then when I got back to the states I was so disappointed that I couldn't find anything like what I had.
3;Good, but not as good as I expected;These are way better than rancid grocery story peanuts, but they weren't as good or as fresh as I'd hoped. I imagine that they'd been stored too long at amazon before being shipped.
5;Loved em!;I bought these gummies recently and they were SO good I had to write a review on them! (even though I hardly ever leave reviews). I found the taste and texture to be PERFECT and the packaging on the box is really cute.
4;Sunflower seeds at Amazon;These were basic sunflower seeds, they taste good and after a couple of bags I haven't found any bad nuts so far. I appreciate being able to buy in quantity for a reasonable price and that they are packed in 16-oz.
1;Horrible!;This is bad coconut milk. It has guar gum which mixes the cream and liquid.
2;Tropicana Pasty Film Taste;Combined with Vitamin D, this brand leaves me with a 'pasty' film on my tongue. It also lacks that 'fresh squeezed' taste that I prefer.
5;Only 10 Calories!;I really LIKE RED BULL, but at 150 calories a can - there was no way that I could have it very often.  I had looked at Costco and other places for the Sugarfree RED BULL to buy in bulk and they didn't carry it.
4;good but not fantastic;these are good but not fantastic. Also do not order in hot weather as the chocolate will melt.
5;Dog loves em;My Corgi absolutely loves Canidae Platinum. He has chronic urinary tract stones, bad kidneys, so he is on a special diet.
5;Heavenly Nectar;This product is positively wonderful!  Use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic, but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch.  Apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat.
1;Worst K-Cup yet - And I am easy to please!;I wanted a nice hot cup of cider. I forced myself to choke down the first cup I tried.
4;Zuke's is good food.;Got my order quickly. It's difficult to find chicken free food and treats and these were a good price.
5;GREAT PRODUCT!!;It has always been a nightmare to give medicine to my dog.  She is now 11 years old and has heart problems and has to take several meds a day.
5;Best Vegan Body Lotion;My favorite vegan body lotion for soft skin and wonderful fragrance..
2;It's taco seasoning + mayo;I've had a couple really good sandwiches at local restaurants lately with chipotle mayo so I was excited to try Kraft's product.  Very disappointing, it is not a pure spicy mayo, it tastes like just a mix of Ortego taco seasoning mixed in mayo.
5;Love it!;I tried this product because I am TRYING to eliminate the white stuff from my diet and as a southerner, I love grits (well, hot cereal to the rest of y'all).  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is on it's own merits.
5;Great value, distinctive packaging, beautiful presentation;"I know the reaction of some people upon receiving this gift might be, ""oh, gee -- a tea collection"", but then they brew it up and see the flowers bloom in the clear glass pot.  The reaction of surprise and delight makes it worth the very modest price."
1;"All Mighty Leaf ""silken"" tea bags are made of corn!";I ordered 12 boxes of Mighty Leaf tea, after trying it a restaurant. The tea is delicious, but I have to give a one star review because the product description is misleading.
4;Good treat;My pup enjoys everlasting treats in or out of an everlasting treat ball. I decided to try the everlocking treat as something different, but it wasn't significantly different when used in the treat ball, and she ate the ends off the stick immediately.
5;Yummy;Very delicious coffee, however these little cups are extremely overpriced. Actually it's price gouging in my opinion, but got to have them to drink the coffee.
5;Delicious coffee - much better than instant;I go camping in a cabin that has no electric, but a wood cook stove.  Boiling water is not a problem, but a coffee pot is.
5;Healthy treats;We buy these by the case for our dogs.  They are a healthy treat and the dogs love them.
4;Added water;I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them.
5;great toddler snack;I have been buying these for about a year now for my 2 boys now 2 and 4yo.  These are a great on the go snack that a mom can feel good about serving up.
5;Fantastically disgusting;These things actually taste like they are described. My girl was so fascinated at the idea of being able to eat candy like Harry Potter ate that she tried the vomit, earwax and soap flavors and giggled her way through every disgusting moment of the assault on her poor little taste buds.
5;My favorite bagged tea...;This is by far and away, the best bagged tea I've ever had. It's extremely smooth and there is no aftertaste that I can detect.
5;Great Taste!;I hate the original green tea but this one is Exceptional! Great taste! No bitter taste, very sweet. You won't regret getting a full box.
5;The BEST POPCORN ever;This the very rich and cheesy popcorn.  I love cheese popcorn and have tried many different kinds but this is the best popcorn by far.
5;oatmeal squares;The perfect cereal for starting your day. Not too high is sugar, healthy, add bananas, raspberries, raisins etc.
5;Nice coffee from around the world;Just got this the other day.  Nice sampler, coffee from many different countries, no blends, just beans from the area.
5;Great flavor without all the sweeteners!!;It's amazing how difficult it is to find a beverage other than water that tastes good without all the sweetness!  I'm too lazy to brew my own tea, so this stuff is perfect!  And it doesn't have a funky flavor like other brands that I've tried.  It's just not easy to find.
5;Wonderful;I was given one of these bars by a friend and began ordering them by the box the next day!  I have an extremely sensitive stomach, and they are a great source of energy for me.  Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.
5;DASQUIN FOR DOGS;Good product, helps especially older dogs with joint problems, my 14 year old lab-Rottie was not walking because of hip pain..
5;Perfect Pasta;After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment.
5;Makes a Great PBJ Sandwich!;So good..
5;Grove Square Hot Cocoa For Keurig;This is the best Hot Cocoa product I have found for the Keurig K-cup Brewer. The others I have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.
2;Funny Aftertaste;I bought these knowing they probably wouldn't be great quality, and I was right. They're not horrible, and going down they taste okay.
5;Pretty good;My son never ate any of these kind of foods. Started with this & he is doing good with these packs.
1;CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE;"I utilized Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" option.  The first time I made the rice, it didn't taste the same as the store bought rice."
4;very strong tea;If you like strong tea (sergeant majors tea where the spoon stands up on its own) you'll like this stuff..
5;Hard to find;I have a specific dish that needs the Golden Onion Recipe specifically and the supermarkets don't seem to carry it though they carry the other Lipton products.<br /><br />It is a lighter color, and seems slightly less salty, than the regular Lipton Onion Recipe.
5;Simply the Best!;Ever since my wife bought some whole-bean Raven's Brew Deadman's Reach a few years ago from a specialty shop in NYC I've been hooked on all their roasts and varieties.  I've been buying Raven's Brew coffees through their website for years now, and although it's not cheap (especially with shipping from the west coast) it's well worth the price.
5;Best Ever;I love this soda!<br /><br />Best ever.<br /><br />If you're just looking to try ginger beer this is the one to get I've never had any better.
5;Love the taste!;It's just the way I like it, chewy & not too sweet.  I'm gonna try different flavors to see if I like them also.
5;Fontana caramel sauce;Awesome product! Just like you get at Starbucks. Fast and prompt delivery too.
5;Repeat!!!;Bought these wondering how hot they'll be..
5;Delicious and potent!  (Do not use in making home made icrecream - vanillin is a natural agent that increases freezing temp);I did not purchase this item on amazon, but have purchased several bottles at a local Mexican food market.  It's flavor is phenomenal.
5;Smaller ones taste differenet;I agree with the other posters that the smaller size slim Jims taste different (and better) than the longer ones.  The extra large fat ones are the worst, IMHO.
5;Gluten-Free, Vegan;This soup is delicious. Anyone claiming some of the pieces are too hard or gritty are not cooking and stirring it properly.
4;Tired of plain water;These MIO drink mixes allow you to add flavor to your bottled water with no sugar or calories. The thing I like best is that you can customize how much flavor by how much MIO you squirt in.
5;fantastic mix of Popchip goodness;We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece.
4;Good;This coffee is not bad.  I was looking for a sronger coffee than the breakfast brend Ive been drinking for a while.
5;moderately priced first-class coffee;We have enjoyed the coffee of the brand without recognizing what kind coffee it was at a hotel we stayed before. Now, we recognized the name remembering that it was the one we had  at the hotel room, and purchased it.
5;"BEYOND ""USEFUL"" . . .";..
5;The absolute BEST, BUT.....they're always running out of stock.  Annoying.;I've tried a lot of macadamias and these are, by far, the freshest and best-tasting of them all.  It'll cost you a little more, but it's worth it.
5;Great blend of flavor.;There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things.
5;Never have seen anything like this!;I could sit and watch this trap work all day. It is amazing how the flies just flock to this bottle and go inside.
1;Horrible Taste;I tried to make cupcakes for my wheat-intolerant mother using this flour blend. I was pretty excited, because my previous GF attempts had involved rice flour, and the cakes would come out quite gritty.
5;wonderful!;"I ordered this because of the price and when it arrived and the box said ""fits MANY keurig brewers"" I was a bit worried.  But the pod fit perfectly in my B70 and the coffee that it made was outstanding."
5;Great;Our dog loves them.  He is 35 lbs and the Regular size is perfect and it seems to help with his teeth.
5;LOVE THESE!;I eat these in salads.  They are pretty plain all by themselves but when you mix them in with a great salad, with a good salad dressing, they really do the trick.
4;Good stuff;"I breastfed through 10 months, but needed something to ""get us through"" until the transition to cow's milk and this worked out well with no gas, fussiness, or constipation.  We had supplemented with <a href=""http://www."
5;The BEST!!!!;Tried the almonds today for the first time.  I'm ordering a case right now.
5;Delectable Pralines;I first tried World Famous Pralines last year at River Street Sweets in Charleston. They were so good I salivated as I anticipated each bite.
5;One of my favorite coffees ever!;I am relatively new to the world of pod coffee, but bought a Bunn My Cafe that I am thrilled with because it brews at the right temperature, easily, and with no ecological waste.  One of the fun aspects of all this is trying out all sorts of coffee pods made by different companies.
5;yummy snacks;the sahale snacks are fantastic.<br />delicious alone or add them to a salad.
5;I Love Frontier;The Frontier Celery Seed Whole, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 3), that I purchased directly from Amazon, is without impurities.  The seeds smell divine and taste even better.
5;Newman's Own;Received this very quickly.  It was securely packed.
5;Good Value;I purchase this product for the office. The clients like it and it is not too over-powering.
5;Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended;This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs.
5;The Delicious Alternative to Coffee;Over the past two years, this has become my favorite morning drink.  I have had gut issues in the past that were exacerbated by the acid in coffee.
5;Yummmm;I use it on popcorn, fries salad, eggs soups etc. I love it! I have not had one bad experience with this yet.
5;Great Hot Cocoa!;My family loves all three flavors. The dark chocolate is my favorite.
3;My cats LOVE this Paw Licking Chicken! But BEWARE of  the fish flavor's of Weruva that contain Menadione;My cats beg for Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken and they didn't beg for their other food which was more expensive.<br />I noticed their coat became shinier and softer after I began to feed them this food.
5;Delicious;This is great butter chicken curry.  I usually marinate the chicken in a package (maybe add some yogurt) for an hour or two and then just add the water as it calls for.
5;why its at aisian markets;the reason this is at asian markets is because it is used in making Thai iced coffee.  find an authentic asian resturant (the SE asians learned french cookery) and order it but ask first if they use cafe dumonde.
3;would not buy again;This coffee has a bitter aftertaste to it and was very diluted on the 8 oz setting.  Not sure why this got so many good review but tastes like cheap coffee.
5;Very Good!;This decaf cappuccino tastes just like the caffeinated stuff. I live in a small town and was unable to find decaf cappuccino anywhere.
1;Grove Square Cappuchino;I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste.
4;Good;My dog likes thse alot..
5;Lots of flavor;For the price, this one has it.  I've been drinking this for a long time and the only one I see coming close on the vanilla is the Coffeemasters brand.
5;My New Favorite Maple Syrup!!;This was my first purchase of Highland Sugarworks Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup, but I promise you that it will not be my last.  It was very flavorful, but not overpowering and a perfect addition to my French Toast this morning.
2;Too Dry for Me;I love black licorice, but I have to say, I'll be giving these away. The flavor is fine, but the licorice is very dry.
4;delicious candy;I love pomegranate and I love licorice so I was very excited to try this product. It is very delicious - good flavor and texture - sweet enough but not too sweet.
5;Bare Fruit Bake-Dried Granny Smith Apple Chips;This snack is delicious and healthy.  It's my daughter's favorite so I send them to her at college, a box of twelve smaller bags so that she can take them with her anywhere.
1;Not impressed;I do not know how to rate this item.  If she would take her picture down a notch (like remove it from the lable) then maybe people would be able to tell what kind of spice it is.
5;I had to say something about it...;"A friend of mine gave me a small bag of this quality corn for my birthday and it is AMAZING! He knew I am a avid fan of popcorn and am always searching for something new. He did mention the hulls and said ""So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good"" and good it was."
5;A++ Service;Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa..
5;I like it!;There are plenty of lemon flavored teas especially among well known brands.  I've bought most of them, used only a few tea bags and just didn't like them due to their artificial flavoring.
1;pretty bad coffee;I ordered this along with a bunch of other whole-bean coffees to try over a weekend, and this was the worst by far.  The beans were dry, powdery, and likely old.
5;Great (wink/wink) Coffee!;I love the Teccinno herbal coffees and I/m starting to like them better than actual coffee. The 3 pack is a great price especially with auto delivery.
5;Pretty good!;Nut free and not just sugar. I tried a pack and they were surprisingly good! They are not hard to chew.
5;David's desertation;I love Mango in any form and tea is just one of many ways to enjoy and you do a great job of making it with the finest products available.  I will reccomend it to all my friends and have already given a box as a gift to a lady friend.
5;No Bugs;Great offer- bulk dog treats for a decent price.  Others reported bugs in the boxes, but these were clean.
4;Yum!;Although I hesitated about ordering for fear of the lollipops arriving broken (as happened to several other reviewers), I was unable to find these in any local stores so I took a chance.  They all arrived in excellent condition.
5;Great flavor, nice kick;"I've never been a big fan of the flavor of energy drinks. To me their flavors are usually ""cherries dipped in gasoline"" or ""lemon/lime bile""."
5;love this;Love this dressing.  the best I have ever tasted, and I'm picky.
4;Tasty and Refresing;Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita provides a 4 pack each worth a pitcherful of a margarita tasting non-alcholic drink.  The taste is actually better than some of the mixes I've had for the alcholic variety but is inferior to a well made version of the real thing .
5;6 month daughter loved it!;She knows the sound of the package of mum mum and she gets excited, she loves it! I ask the pediatrician and she said was fine to give to my baby. Plus she loves it! I will always have in the diaper bag whatever i go.
5;great price for a product hard to find in stores;bought this tea online because my local stores stopped carrying it.  Great price - cheaper than I used to buy it.
5;Great taste for on the go;These taste great and help keep you satisfied. First tried one on a hike in the Sonoran Desert.
3;Not spicy.;"This sauce was okay as a general pasta sauce, though sweeter than what I prefer. It is sweeter than most common store brands (Bertolli and Publix brands are my standbys), which is surprising given the claim of ""no sugar added."
5;BUSH'S BEST BAKED BEANS BOLD & SPICY;BUSH'S BEST BAKED BEANS BOLD & SPICY.<br /><br />12 cans, 28 ounces each.
1;now i know whats wrong with my dog;i have just brought one small package of Canidea from my oversea agent 2weeks ago, before my puppy only tried a french brand. First i was just mixed them together and seems ok, but then the old finished there is something weird happened to her, she started eating the stools??!! >:( yes and also vomited white yellowish foam and coughing after totally swished into this brand, even sent her to vet checking blood, taking pills and medical treat which i was thinking she might catch cold.
5;Summery snack.;These crispy, flower-shaped thins really taste like blueberries.  They're like a summer picnic.
4;Clam Chowder;Pretty good stuff but I found it cheaper at the local grocery store after buying it on Amazon.  Not the best canned chowder I've ever purchased and nothing is as good as home made but it works for a quick snack.
5;Yummmmmmm;These taste great not too sweet and they don't stain your tounge! The kids love em too. The price is right too.
5;apple cider K cups;very good.  I didn't realize it was sugar free.
3;Great product but I don't like the packaging;I love these and my 8 month old loves them but I don't think the product canister does a good job of keeping them fresh.  It seems like they go stale VERY fast.
5;Mrs.;The product is ideal! It's my favorite flavor and the containers are perfect for work and home . I have shared with family, friends and co -workers.
5;My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits;I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.
5;Warms the soul........;I keep this on hand for the young at heart.  We enjoy a cup almost every night.
3;My cats don't like the salmon;This is a great product and my three cats eat the Tuna Too Cool and the Tuna and Chicken canned food, but they don't like salmon, I guess.  You would just have to try it to know for sure.
5;Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues;If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc.
5;Excellent Preserve;All of my local supermarkets stopped carrying Smuckers Cherry Preserves, and this is my family's favorite flavor. I was SO relieved when I found it on Amazon.
5;I prefer the flavored;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
5;Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies - My New Favorite;Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are now my favorite cookies.  They are so soft and delicious.
1;dripping in oil;I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil.
5;dog cookies;My dogs love these cookies. And they are not made in China.
2;weak English Breakfast tea;despite it's good reviews, I found this tea weak and not even close to the Twinings EB tea. Too bad that tea is no longer on subscribe and save.
5;DELICIOUS NUTRITIOUS on the go;My 3 y.o.
4;Doggies Addicted!;I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.
5;great product;this is a wonderful, tasty beef jerky.  i buy it for my son in new york because he loves beef jerky and he said this wild ride beef jerky was the best.
5;Makes excellent iced tea.;Makes excellent iced tea. I like to compost and hated having all those non-degradable tea bags.
1;Not even close to Cappuccino;I bought this for my granddaughter because she will drink a cappuccino from most any where. When she was not using them, she used 2, I asked her what was wrong.
5;A Fun Twist;"This Jelly Belly box is a fun twist on the theme, and makes a great gift.  My father enjoyed following ""recipes"" on the back to make new flavors (e."
3;Some are great some are really bad;I gave this product 3 stars  because depending on the type it is a full 5 stars or only 1 star.<br /><br />The herb kit grew quick.
5;The Greatest;We enjoy this wonderful tea - lemon, diet,decaffinated,instant and always fresh.  We order several at a time because it is sealed and keeps it strength without a worry.
5;The best Ghee around;Grass Fed Ghee by Pure Indian Foods is the best Ghee on the market, in my opinion. It tastes better than the rest, and is wonderful to cook with because of it's high heat capability without burning.
5;Cat loves the flavor;Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day.
5;Delicious!;These morels are very good.  They add  great flavor and texture to omelets, soups, and stews.
4;Very Juicy Like;As advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink.  The taste is similar to Orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth  feel.
4;Delectable, Filling Cookies With Low Calories Make a Healthy Snack;"These are are crunchy, delectable cookies that come in a variety of flavors, of which, I find The Original & Gingerspice tastier than others - 5 stars. What I find very puzzling is that Amazon has different flavors under Amazon Prime at different times: last week it was The Original and now it is <a href=""http://www."
4;Very good ingredient list with extras.;I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him.
5;DisposaKup Lids;My main concern about my Keurig coffee machine was the waste generated by the disposable K-cups.  This product enables me to re-use the K-cups and get a great cup of coffee with my choice of coffee grinds while having a less negative impact on the environment.
5;My Puppy LOVES these!;These are one of my dog's FAV's. I am glad I can get them through Amazon.
1;worst tea in the world;How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything.
5;THE BOMB!;To me this is the best cereal ever for breakfast or snacking.  It's delicious-stays crunchy(disagree totally with the person that said it got soggy-try it with just a little bit of almond milk-MMMMM).
5;Cool Capp Mocha tasted like Gloria Jeans Mocha Iced Coffee;I was very pleased with Cool Capp Double Mocha Iced Coffee Mix. I felt it tasted like the iced coffee I get at Gloria Jeans when I am at the mall.
5;GREAT LIGHT TASTING BLACK TEA;My sister recommended this tea to me after watching a Dr. Oz program and I decided to try it.
3;Looks like a good product, but I won't purchase again.;The smell is very enticing to my two dogs, but quite objectionable to my husband. I gave half a treat to both dogs and my shepherd mix threw up within minutes of eating it.
5;Great buy;I bought this item to eat healthier and was very surprised at the fantastic taste.  My grandson loves them.
2;It's instant;I was disappointed with this product.  It's instant coffee, sugar, and powdered creamer/milk.
3;Good quality seeds;These are good quality pumpkin seeds. Virtually all of the seeds are whole seeds (vs.
2;Grind Is Too Fine;Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.
5;Delightful!;I am very happy with the flavor of this coffee! I make my coffee using one scoop per two cups of cold water and that makes a nice moderately dark coffee. I usually add a little dollop of creamy caramel macchiato which brings out the smooth, sweet vanilla taste and decreases any bitterness of the blend.
5;Simply Unbeatable;My boyfriend swears by this tea. He'll go through several cups a day and be over a cold in a couple days whereas the rest of the guys he works with will drug themselves up on advil cold and sinus and be out for two weeks.
5;Cinnamon Mmmm-MMmm-MMMm-MMMM;It's too bad these are gone now - and it makes me glad I bought the store out (not just a couple tins, mind you, but =every= =one= Circuit City had in stock).  These are just The Bomb mints.
1;Not consumable;Worst protein product ever.  It was impossible to get down 2 chips.
5;Tasty noodles once you get the hang of cooking them;The first recipe I tried with these noodles was a complete disaster.  I tried just throwing them into a soup I was making and they completely dissolved.
5;Tasty and convenient;This is an instant sweetened ginger mix that you add hot water to.  It comes packaged in single serving foil wrapped packs.
5;Enjoyable treat!;If you are looking for a great relaxing cup of coffee with great flavor this is the one for you. I bought a small box which ran out quickly since we all love the coconut taste.
5;YUM!;This is the second time I have bought this product, and I just love it..
5;Great treat for a great toy !;My dog LOVES this flavor, though he also loves the other flavors as well!  I swear by these treats and the Everlasting Treat Ball which these cookie treats fit in.  I have to keep a constant supply of these cookie inserts on hand just to insure that I don't run out.
5;Best Almonds Hands Down;After trying every kind of almond out there over the years, I will take these flavorful Blue Diamond almonds any day.  They are fresh, salted just right and not greasy/oily.
5;Manuka Honey great for healing leg ulcer after surgery;I recently had surgery to remove a dead vain in my lower right leg that caused a ulcer. A friend of mine recommended manuka honey, saying it helps keep the skin moist (which in my case would promote skin growth), among other things.
1;ROHS packaging & food safety;"This raw organic cacao powder came in one of those electronics static bags you'd normaly see a chipset or hard drive with a recycle symbol 7 & 11-PET, ALU, PE. I was told it was ""food-safe"" by the seller and that ""nestl&eacute"
5;great taste and value;I used to buy this stuff at the store and this is a way better deal than can be found anywhere. I get it automatically delivered to my house each month.
5;Must Have;This is a must have in the kitchen for anyone who doesn't, or can't (i.e.
5;Gel Paste;the shade of brown is perfect for what I need. The product was larger than I expected so it's a good price for the quantity and quality.
4;Dog approved;So I got a box of these for my 3 year old Norwegian Elkhound. All dog owners know that there are many, many products out there that claim to clean your dog's teeth.
5;Emerils big and wonderful;Love the strong bold taste. So good you can get two cups from one pod.
5;Yummy in my tummy!!;All of the Kosugai product are very high quality, the flavors are incredibly juicy and true to life, mainly because the actual fruit is a main ingredient, but its not anything like those 'fruit leathers' this is an actual candy, it is the closest thing to eating the actual fruit as it gets in terms of juiciness and flavor. I buy these all the time now, I love all the flavors, particularly the Mangosteen, Lychee, kiwi, and strawberry.
4;Great product;You have to really like cashew to buy this product. I could not find a good price on unsalted cashews and gave 4 stars because I felt it was too salty.
5;Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend;A smooth light roast for your morning coffee break. This is my favorite blend, not too strong with excellent flavor.
5;Dry hot wings;I find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when I'm craving buffalo wings late at night. Sure they're not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor.
5;Come and Get It!;Bought this stuff TWICE, it's just that good, even my fussy WANT A HOME COOKED MEAL boyfriend loves it, I cook up two boxes at a time when we want a little more and of course it stores in the fridge for a couple of days or so quite well too.  Great bunch of flavors and the pasta is really good too.
5;Surprisingly delicious!;"Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand ""Popchips"", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn."
5;One of the best;For those who don't know, cacao nibs are small pieces of the cacao beans from which chocolate is made.  They are roasted much like coffee beans, and even have a somewhat similar nutty flavor, in addition to being chocolatey.
1;Not really smarties brand;I bought these and they were not the smarties brand, they actually do not say smarties anywhere on the box or the wrappers. Do not buy they are gross and not the real product they describe.
5;My mom loves these!;"I was pleasantly surprised by the simple goodness of these snacks.  They remind me more of fruit that has been ""freeze-dried"" (like the ice cream at the Air and Space Museum in DC, if you are familiar) than of conventional dried fruit."
5;Very tastey;I'm a terrible cook, so i am always looking for things that are quick and easy.  I really liked these noodles.
2;Dog doesn't like it.;This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day.
5;Highly Recommended;I ordered these on sale on the evening of 02/08/10,( ususlly with an item on sale such as this, you get gouged on the shipping/processing fees, but that was not the case with this vendor!) and they were on my doorstep on 2/11/10. Excellent communications from this vendor, with an email order confirmation,and an order shipped/tracking confirmation, and super fast shipping.
3;Marinade not good enough. Not recommended as is.;On my personal scale of 0(worst) to 5 (best), I have tasted this octopus and rated it as follows IMHO: presentation-visual appeal 3/5
1;why would you put EGGS in sweet potatoes???;Just make plain Sweet potatoes. I can
4;Surprisingly Good Tea from Amazon;I was hesitant about ordering this the first time, but was surprised at how good it tastes. It has a true black tea flavor with just the right amount of lemon.
5;makes a lot of Senso to buy this stuff from Amazon!!;Great Deal on the Pods. Wife uses them in our single cup maker.
3;Gluten Free Cookies;The cookies are okay in taste. They are a little too sweet for me.
3;It's OK;I will review this shampoo along with its conditioner, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounces (https://www.
2;Cherry - Really?;I was expecting a cross between soda and juice with this.  Turns out that it tastes just like apple juice.
5;Wow how had I not known about this;I came across this after getting emailed some coupons including one for Jolly Time from Amazon.<br />There were only a few reviews but everyone seemed to like it, so I ordered a case along with another flavor.
5;Good food;My 35 pound lab/terrier mix loves this food. I used it as a mix-in with her kibble.
5;Great tasting protein bars;These bars are great for people that have had gastric bypass surgery. Very good and they don't leave an after taste.
5;A ginger lover's best choice.;I've been eating Jing Jing Jahe for the past 15 years, even taking some with me when traveling in Indonesia, where it is manufactured.  When you first put a candy in your mouth, you might wonder where the ginger heat is, but don't worry.
4;Good tasting snaps, although some hard, some chewy;This review is for Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps, Family Recipe Cookies.<br />These ginger snaps taste good.
4;Good food for the fish line;The only downside about this food is that it contains BHA/BHT. As long as you don't overload your cats with this every single day you should be fine, but be cautious of the purrfectly chicken/turkey variety because it does contain BY-products.
5;The spiciest chai;I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink.
1;Bad packing!;All cookies arrived brocken. Such expensive cookies and so poor pack! I believe the manufacturer should improve the way that they pack.
5;Good Stuff...;Stuff works great and the caffeine gives a great pick-me-up when you get down in the spirits on the long runs..
4;Each Flavor is Very Different;"My favorite is hazelnut, not too sweet and no peculiar aftertaste - I would rank hazelnut 5 stars. The french vanilla is very sweet, taste is not so much ""vanilla"" as it is just very sweet almost syrupy taste - I would rank french vanilla 4 1/2 stars."
5;Confessions of a Finicky Eater, Part Two;Hello. My name is Maggie, and I'm a finicky eater.
5;Cats LOVE this Dry Food. Best Commercial Product List I've Found in Reasonably Priced Commercial Pet Food.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.;I have 4 indoor cats ranging from pre-teen to senior. We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store.
4;Potato chips are very good and worth trying out.;"I don't know why these reviews seem to cover more then just one type of TERRA potato chips, I think amazon should have seperate reviews but this review is in regards to ""Terra Yukon Gold Potato Chips"" I think these chips are really good, I like them a lot. If I eat them for too many days tho I think it gives me the baked chips sensation/taste and I am not into that."
3;Over Priced - Cheaper at Costco;Popchips are good and great for diet snack. But on Amazon the price is nearly double the cost of Costco.
4;Overpriced at Amazon;I like all of the Larabars that I have tried.  They taste good and are able to satisfy my appetite.
5;nice assortment!;Just recieved this box and was very pleased.  In this box of 24 k-cups there were 11 different flavors, of not more than 3 of any one (most 2).
5;Perfect;I got these for my wife as she loves truffles. She absolutely loved them! This is a great sampler of decadent chocolates.
3;disappointed that mine did not sprout well;While I may find other uses for these seeds I wanted them for sprouts. I soaked a couple tablespoons for 24 hours in my sprouter, rinsed twice daily, but after a week still only a few seeds have sprouted.
5;Love this tea;This tea has so much flavor, its so wonderful.  And I love the sayings on the tea bag.
5;delicious;These are great for your morning coffee without having to have any cream or sugar.These are delicious and easy to use in K Cup form.
3;Tastes great but didn't work for me;I received two free samples to try out and I decided to try the first one on the night I did my job until midnight. I had gotten up at six am and knew I would be up until past midnight so I decided to try the first one after dinner to see if it would help keep me up until midnight, I didn't think it was going to taste very good but I was presently surprised, I certainly didn't feel any different than I did before I drank it but I did decided to try the next one the next night with no change, I guess I just have natural energy :)I did not have any jitters or anything like that which I was worried about.
2;A poor option;There's a lot of beef jerky choices out there.  This stuff had a dry, brittle, hard to chew consistency and poor flavor.
5;Best Coffee;Best coffee that I have found and I have looking for a long time. I have ordered coffee from small roasters and large ones.
5;Ready yourself.;These mints are addictive.  Sinfully delicious.
5;smooth;Nice smooth flavor.  This has a nice coffee flavor without the strong bitterness you find in so many these days.
5;these are great;These items that you go through in a hurry are great to add to your list to get your free shipping offers!  I use these for my very large dog and she goes through them very fast, so, as usual, Amazon offers everything you could need and if not cheaper than usual which they usually are, they at least cost the same and help you get your free shipping.  I got them in a reasonable amount of time and was ready when the last ones were gone!  Thanks for these opportunities to stay home and get my favorite items shipped right to my door.
4;Good for swimmers;I used this shampoo and found that it gave me too much volume. My two kids are swimmers and this shampoo worked well for them.
4;I like these individual boxes but;the price thru Amazon is ridiculous.  If you go to Big Lots, you can sometimes find these for $.
5;Delicious!;"I want so badly to make my almond milk, so while I'm still working on my ""craft"" I buy it in the meantime. My kids love Rice Dream, so I figured it was time to give this a try, too."
4;good product;Was not disappointed in this product. Taste good and not too salty and provide a good crunch.
4;Yes, yes, and yes.;This coffee is absolutely amazing. Don't get a BLEND do not, do not buy a blend.
5;After a month, I am a believer;I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past.
1;Must have been a contaminated batch;We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can.
5;Really good.;My 12 year old son who is gluten, dairy, soy, and egg free loves this bar. He is a little particular about his bars and there are limited choices that meet his dietary requirements.
3;Great dressing, but expires too soon.;I bought this dressing for my son and his girlfriend, who absolutely love it.  Unfortunately, the six bottles expire in six months, so they probably won't get to use it all in time.
5;Great snack with or without dip.;These chips are great by themselves or with salsa, pico de gallo, cheese dip, sour cream dip--probably any dip you like.  They have just enough salt, but not too much.
5;Much better then I anticipated;These are much better then I thought they would taste.  They have a good crunch and are true to graham flavor with a hint of saltiness.
5;My Wire Fox Terrier Loves Them!!!;These are my 3 year old wire fox terrier's favorite treats of all, and he's a picky little guy.  He's not a big fan of even smoked, flavored rawhides, and sometimes may even turn his nose up at a smoked pig ear (though that is rare and usually just when he's pouting).
5;Made our dog ENJOY meal time!;Our dog was such a finicky eater before we got this toy.  He would bore easily of eating out of his dish, and we found that he was eating below his recommended daily intake.
2;Received crushed tomatoes, not diced tomatoes;Cento is a decent brand but I ordered DICED tomatoes and received concentrated crushed tomatoes.  Amazon sent a replacement order and the second order was also crushed tomatoes.
4;made my Saturday morning.;"I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being ""really good""."
1;Huge Rip-Off!!!;Nearly $8 for a little tin of curry powder? Amazing.<br /><br />Either make your own (many recipes online) or buy another brand in an Asian grocery store or online for $2 or so.
5;good;I am so glad to have these around for snacking.  The stores around here don't always stock them so it was nice to get an entire boxful, which I am still eating.
2;Soft , Sticky and unbalanced taste;For someone who enjoy sweet and sour taste gummy, this might not be the best choice. I enjoy sour candies a lot, but this is surely not one of my favorite.
5;These are great and with subscribe n save its cheaper than buying at Sams Club;Both my girlfriend and I use these, not everyday but those days when you know you need something to help get you going or days when we work overtime. I have to say they do work, some days we split one to save a little more but I have to say they do work, I asked my doctor if they were safe and he said sure when used in moderation as with everything else.
5;Great sampler pack;Being new to Popchips, never even heard of Popchips until I saw the gold box deal of the day, even with the deal of the day, the packs seemed expensive - 24 pack for $12.99 with free Amazon Prime shipping, and the bags are only 0.
5;Incredible value;Provided you aren't a staunch traditionalist, this vinegar is astonishingly good, especially for the price. Maletti has figured out how to produce a 6 year-old vinegar with the density and concentration of much older, far more expensive fully traditional balsamics without resorting to obvious cheats like adding sweeteners and thickening agents.
5;Soothing tea!;Sure miss being able to pick it up in the stores. This is my favorite tea during the cooler months.
5;Pit Bull loves Bully Sticks;Our Pit Bull loves Bully sticks.  These are so far the best value I have found.
3;Makes a tasty chicken substitute when prepared right...;"I've been trying many of the vegetarian and vegan meat options sold here on Amazon, and this was one of them. The first time we tried these ""grilled chicken"" strips we didn't precook them and put them in an enchilada bake."
3;Okay;Not one of my favorites.  I found it fairly salty.
4;picky dog didn't like;I'm sure this product is fine, my dog is just incredibly picky.  Received quickly and in good condition.
4;It doesn't get much easier than this!;I first had Bisto in the early 1970s when I visited a friend in England. I'm not sure what prompted me to buy this product on Amazon almost 40 years later but I'm always looking for quick and easy ways to enhance meals .
2;Inconsistent quality;When I first started ordering this product on Amazon I received damaged cans - every single can on the wrapped pallet of twelve cans was dented so I know it didn't happen during shipping.  The food was also dry so I stopped ordering the product after receiving two shipments of poor quality product.
3;Where's the Lobster?...;As Asian cup n noodles go, these are great. Full of flavor and super quick.
2;Unnatural & Artificial;Back in the day I used to love the single use Crystal Light packets that you would pour into a 16.9 oz water bottle and drink.
5;Wow Mints;These are great mints.  I love starlight mints, but I am trying to be more responsible about what I eat.
5;Gluten free chips;I love these gluten free chips.  They are crispy and crunchy and the flavors are quite good.
4;Convenient and reasonably priced;The convenience factor in ordering a case of oatmeal works for me.  The product was exactly what I wanted for a price that was comparable to finding it on sale in the stores.
1;From concentrate;If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.
5;Superb;Products like this are hard to find, so if you've stumbled upon The Missing Link just go ahead and buy it. The product - which is basically a course powder of whole foods & nutrients - goes right into your cats wet or dry food & tho cats are notoriously picky.
1;Cheaper at the store;I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8..
3;Croutons?;First, I want to preface criticism with a compliment..
5;amazingly delicious almonds;These almonds are the most wonderfully satisfying snack ever. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds then you will absolutely love these nuts.
3;good chocolate;These are tasty but expensive for how many you actually get. I ordered them for a baby shower and everyone seemed to enjoy them.
2;Disappointing.;My Mallomars looked like they were either very old and past their shelf life or (more likely) had been stored in a facility that was too hot or too cold for the cookies. The chocolate looks ashy and is cracked and the cookies taste a little stale.
3;Disappointing;After reading the reviews I ordered a case, but was disappointed. The taste was much more bland than I had expected, lacking the tinge of  tartness I had come to expect with smaller, more expensive sardines.
5;Pure Black Walnut is hard to find.;The recipe my Grandmother passed down calls for pure Black Walnut Extract.  The grocery only had artifical Black Walnut so I looked online and found this product.
4;BOB MARLEY WOULD LIKE THIS I THINK;I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.
5;Best tea I have ever had!;Best tea I have ever had.  I actually feel better (health-wise) when I drink it.
4;Something new to brew in your espresso machine;This review is only based on the espresso brewing method. I used a Racillio Silvia espresso machine.
5;Michael Seasons Unsalted Potato Chips;These are the best chips ever!  They are unsalted and being on a low sodium diet critical in allowing my husband and I to eat chips.  They are all natural and low fat which is a great extra bonus.
5;Surprisingly good;I was pleasantly surprised at how good this coffee is at less than six dollars a pound. Add on the free shipping and this makes an excellent value.
5;My favorite cereal;This is delicious! Great product. Only one complaint, the bag has to be cut open.
5;Best Breakfast Tea;I first found this tea in a specialty store and paid over $15 for one container of it, so you get a good deal on here (since you get 2 containers). I enjoy this tea with a hint of sugar, but you could also add milk if you like.
5;Satisfied customer;I've ordered Nutiva Hemp seeds numerous times and have been satisfied with the product they sell.  I will continue to get my Hemp seeds from Nutiva .
5;Great puppy food!;My german shepherd puppy loves this food.  It is very soft, so it mixes with her dry food easily.
5;Love this stuff;I keep a box in the pantry.  Helps me from snacking all the time and now I found that it even helps me get over a nasty flu symptoms.
5;Best Value (Price/Quality) Olive Oil;"I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong ""green"" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened."
5;Can't live without it!;I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.
5;Absolutely the best!;Halo Liv-A-Littles® White Meat Chicken Protein Treats, 2.2 oz.
5;Yummmmm!;Love these fruit cups and I WILL be purchasing more. I received them within the week of when the order was placed.
4;Great for cooking and spread.;I have been enjoying this product as a spread for waffles in the morning (with a little cinnamon) and for cooking fish and other stir fry dishes.  Makes for a nice change from olive oil and it has a lovely flavor and scent.
5;It really does what it says!;I got this for my Girlfriend, who admittedly has a black thumb.  In 2 weeks, we have watched the plants not only grow, but thrive.
3;Product has changed;"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked."
5;Yummy cereal;I love this cereal, and lately they no longer sell it in stores in my area.  I grew up eating this cereal.
5;Excellent instant coffee that tastes like brewed;The perfect choice when you're on the go or just don't feel like brewing an entire pot of coffee! Taster's Choice French Roast is delicious, smooth, velvety, and rich. This is the best instant coffee I have ever had.
4;Good selection, good value;"I've ordered this a few times for myself and as gifts, and it's always appreciated. Having lived in the Pacific Northwest for a few years, I get that ""deja vu"" feeling whenever I eat salmon smoked the way SeaBear does theirs."
1;Yuck!;Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 32-Ounce Bag (Purchased on 02/19/2009)<br /><br />This was the worst product I have ever tasted. I have had many Oberto products, and this was nothing like what I've eaten before.
5;A little pricy but the best gum around... now;This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago. (This stuff is also made by Hersey).
4;Wonderfully disgusting (dont pay more than 5 bucks for the 2 pack);A few human flavors mixed with some amazingly gross and disgusting flavors.  Im not going to tell you about them, find out yourself.
5;tastes great;has a good taste. it is a great breakfast drink and has a good amount of vitamins.
5;The World's Best Sweetener;Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.
4;Pretty good, if you have the right brewer;I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.
5;A wonderful product;We love this salad, but it is not sold in the North East for some reason.  I am really glad Amazon offers it for sale.
4;Fiber for dogs;When my male dog developed recurrent anal gland infections, the vet recommended adding canned pumpkin to his meals for fiber.  Unfortunately canned pumpkin is a seasonal item in local stores.
5;YUM!!!!;I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts.
5;Dessert for breakfast!;I really enjoy this coffee.  The butter toffee flavor is subtle, but definitely present.
5;Van Houtte chocolage rasberry  K-Cup;This coffee has a wonderful aroma.  I usually don't drink coffee with cream and sugar but I like this particular flavor better with a little cream and sugar.
5;exquisitely dark and satisfying;I work in a business that sells gourmet coffee beans so I like to check out the competition. We sell lots of organic coffee.
5;Our Six Dogs LOVE The Lickety Stik!!!;"Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their ""licks"" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it."
5;Nestle, fat free hot cocoa mix is delicious;I love this product.  I use it hot or cold (in the blender with ice).
4;Love them!;I love the small packaging,<br />I love the taste (BBQ is my favorite)..
5;YUMMY!;these are the most delicious popcorn chip i have ever tasted this flavor is my favorite but impossible to find in any store ..
1;Horrible;This is awful. Very bad aftertaste.
5;Miracle Supplement;Magnesium is vitally important on many levels.  It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind.
5;Very good hot chocolate!;I hesitated to try this after reading some of the other reviews. Also, I was not a big fan of the Suchard hot chocolate for the Tassimo, so I wasn't sure if this would be worth the money.
5;Second to none!;This hot sauce is the best tasting around. I've been using this sauce for over 10yrs.
5;Tully's French Roast K cups;I have had my Keurig coffee maker for over 2 years, in fact I replaced my original on its two year anniversary due to our water's mineral content but that is another story.  Over the past two years I have tried many of the different coffees.
5;THEY'RE GREAT!!! Don't listen to the negative reviews;Don't listen to the negative reviews, they're completely wrong.  I read the reviews but still went ahead and bought it and was very surprised at how fantastic these noodles are.
5;Excellent Coffee;This is definitely one of the best coffees I have ever had. The seller delivered promptly and the product was sublime.
3;Not my dog's favorite..;The main thing here is, your dog has to like it and eat it, not how healthy it is for him.  My dog will eat this when there are no other options (Ex.
4;Best sour cream & onion chip I've had;"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends."
2;Tastes artificial!;I was willing to give this a chance even after reading that scathing review by another poster, but I wish I had just listened in the first place.<br /><br />Without adding cardamom or cloves, I made the tea as per the instructions and steeped it for 15 minutes.
5;Very Tasty;Cooks great in 2 minutes in my microwave. Easy to serve in container.
5;Yummy;Delicious!  We reordered this juice again immediately and put it on auto ship.  The flavor is not compromised like Walnut Acres apple juice.
4;Maldon Sea Salt;Delivery was fast and satisfactory.  Despite a review I read online that ranked this salt as best, I do not like it as well as Fleur de Sel de Camargue (Tresor des Sauniers), which I think is milder and more flavorful.
5;love them;my dog goes crazy over this treat! easy to handle because it is not a moist or wet treat. Using it as my pal to get him to learn all the important commands like sit, down, drop it.
5;Very delicious;This tea is absolutely amazing.  It's like drinking candy.
5;Super good.;These crackers are labeled healthy and good.  They are definately good.
4;Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general;The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.
4;TIM'S REVIEW;Excellent product, takes the guess work out of preparing Crab Cakes. So much simpler than using eggs, baking powder, parsley flakes and dried mustard.
5;My favorite tea;I haven't purchased this item from Amazon, but I came here to find it since I haven't been able to get it locally recently. I started drinking tea because of the health benefits, but I didn't really care for it.
4;Awesome;Yes..
1;My dog hates it;Four times I have put out this product for my dag and each time he smells it and then walks away. I just gave the unused food to my friends German Shepherd.
1;Weak taste;I've tried many of the Sweetleaf Stevia liquid flavors and have throughly enjoyed all of them, but the root beer one is one I will never buy again.<br /><br />I love root beer, even diet root beer and this liquid is very weak compared to the other liquids.
5;Kona coffee;First drank this coffee at my Sister in laws home on the big island. I was surprised to find it on Amazon.
2;Beware of the k-cup count, not worth it!;"I did not read the k-count carefully and was extremely disappointed to realize that I paid over $1 each per k-cup for these teas. In addition, it is packaged in a ""gift box"" which is just a plain white box that look like someone took their leftovers and sold them."
1;dangerous product;As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first.
5;Best of the best tea;This tea was recommended to me by an Irish tenor--- no joke-at an Irish festival in Pittsburgh,PA about 10 years ago! If you want a rich full flavor, lovely golden/amber color, and great hot or iced tea then this is your tea also. If you want flavor-- add your own orange, mint, etc-- but so good just like it is, I rarely do that.
5;yummy;Deep river snacks are the best chips ever!!! I'm addicted to the zesty jalapeno and haven't tried other flavors. I recommend this brand to everyone.
2;Did I just get a lemon?;I researched every available baby food maker on amazon.com and this one seemed to be the best bang for the buck.
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;Do not buy thses!;They have a bad taste,i finish giving them away because my son started to cry everytime i tried to give these.I prefer Beech nut or Gerber.
5;Good stuff;The effects last a long time for a long workout.  The caffeine is 270mg but feels better than that.
5;Stash Premium English Tea - my tiny bit of solitude;"I thoroughly enjoy this tea, in the morning before my Husband, son, dogs, and the day get up.  For my 15 minutes of ""me time"", I'll curl up in the quiet of my living room, with my cat snuggled at my feet, I sip my tea, and welcome the day."
5;yum!;Great product. Very crunchy, naturally sweet, low calorie, great snack! I will get these again for sure.
5;Yum!;This is one of my favourite teas.  My mom had picked up some a couple summers ago so that I'd have some tea to drink while visiting her.
3;Too sweet;There a few things I liked about this product. Being an iced-coffee lover, I really appreciated the ease of having a can ready to go in the fridge and the serving size was just right.
4;Surprisingly good chips;I have been buying popped chips at my Weight Watchers meetings (their brand) and loved them so when I saw these on Amazon, I had to try them. I loved having the assortment to sample--barbeque was my favorite--but they were actually all pretty good.
5;It is just what I expected, and it is good, though it is made in China, what can we say???Big money is in controll;The product is what I had expected and as I had used this MAGGI always in Germany, it is the same tasting flavor.  Priced a little high, especially when you add shipping to it.
5;great snack;The peanuts are shipped quickly and arrived within a week of ordering them. I really enjoy snacking on the peanuts.
5;Crunch. Wow!;Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.
5;Newman's Own Organics Dog Food;I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.
1;"Timothy's ""TNT"" Decaf K-Cups";BEWARE! Do not purchase this product. The cups are defective and explode while brewing.
4;it is OK;I am having difficulties to find a good tea in this country. This one is above average tea with good but not the outstanding flavour.
5;not sugar;This product, Xylosweet, has no aftertaste and is used just like sugar.  It's all natural.
5;HOT, amazing flavor with a few drops;its hot hot hot sauce. serious.
1;Too Salty to Enjoy;I just received these a few days ago. Had my first one only minutes ago.
5;OFF THE  CHAIN;"Tootsie Roll "" Frooties "" Are Off the chain . The Flavors are Delicious."
5;Way Better Than Cheerios;"I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.  Kashi is really expensive in the grocery stores nearby, so we get monthly subscribe-and-save deliveries of the following:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www."
5;Singlets Made For Snacking;Great idea.  Individual packets of graham crackers just perfect for snacking.
5;Great Tasting...;Bridgford Pepperoni,Old world, has to be one of the great tasting pepperoni's for anyone who likes pepperoni. I have had three orders of this pepperoni, the last being this past Christmas, wow what a surprising  Christmas gift, and I will be ordering more in the furture.
4;Healthy portions of flavor despite healthiness;"This is a tasty cereal with all kinds of vitamins and minerals. The grains and seeds make for a healthy breakfast (even by modern <a href=""http://www."
5;Excellent, I think;My cat was 20 years old and in severe CRF when I first bought this.<br /><br />She has always been a picky eater, and now was almost a non-eater.
5;Yummy Lard!;I bought this for a children's birthday party and I became hooked. Not only on the home made lard ice cream, also the lard shakes, and cakes.
1;Dog Will Not Touch This Stuff;I bought this food back in February and the bag is still sitting in the pantry almost completely full. The dog simply will not eat it.
5;Best black tea I've ever had.;This stuff is so much better than the garbage available in stores here in the US. Stronger, yet it goes down smooth without any bitter aftertaste.
5;Greenies Pill Pockets;Such a wonderful and easy way to give your pet a pill.  And with Amazon, it's much cheaper than buying them at the vet's office or any store.
5;1 Liter for about the calories of a can of coke;First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water.  I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.
5;Gag gift;Delivery was fast and any disatisfaction that I have is not with the manufacturer or distributor. I live in a really hot area and was unaware of the melting point of Gummy material.
4;Excellent Product;Pros: Delicious on just about everything. Seller shipped quickly.
2;I liked it at first...;The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it.
5;Birch Beer forever!;I love this stuff
5;A good product made better;I've been using Vacu Vin's previous model for years and have been happy with it.  The one downside of the earlier offering was that wine lovers never knew when a vacuum was achieved.
5;wellness cat food;My fussy allergic cat loves this stuff!<br />She is allergic to almost all cat food
2;150 calories for 6 cookies, -- way too much frosting;When I got these, I was looking for frosted animal crackers. However what I didn't realize is these have an abundance of frosting -- they're not just frosted on top, but covered in frosting.
3;Average Tea, Nice Extras;I was prepared to not really like this. Green tea usually does not take to being flavored very well.
1;Why Add Sugar To Dental Chews?;Be aware that this product contains a form of sugar (dextrose) and is listed on the label as one of the main ingredients. To me this makes about as much sense as putting sugar in toothpaste.
4;Great ingredients, not for my cat however;I have been having issues finding a food that's good for my 11 year old cat. I was on Blue Buffalo which he liked but it made his waste smell really bad.
5;Excellent For Homemade Yogart;I use this organic powdered non-fat milk to produce homemade yogart.  I feel confident that I'm making the healthiest, nonfat yogart with this product.
1;Disgusting what they put in dog food.;Don't buy this dog food, it's pure junk. Full of corn, by-products and other bad ingridients.
2;Did Not Like The Taste;I will continue to use this product from time to time to see I can find something I like it on, but only in something like soup. I did not like the flavor of it on sandwiches, eggs, tomatoes, etc.
5;Better than I expected!!;How can these taste so wonderful? The ingredients are all fruit--No sugar! They are crunchy and so sweet. My husband, 16 year old son, 2 year old daughter and myself all love them.
5;no substitute;I grew up on V.M.
4;Crack for dogs!;I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.
4;Wolfgang's Hazlenut;"This one is my wife's favorite of all the Hazlenut blends she has tried. This is her ""go to"" after a busy day of being retired."
3;Not the best I've had...;I ordered these based upon the reviews here and the fact that it seemed like a bargain.  Unfortunately, I was not as pleased as I expected to be.
5;awesome;I love this pumpkin syrup! I put two pumps in my coffee everyday. Going to be sad when it's gone.
5;Relieved to find this family favorite;This has long been the family's favorite meat marinade, but we have not been able to find it in the local grocery stores for quite some time.  My concern when ordering was if I would get 'old' product that had been sitting in a warehouse.
5;cat treat;The product is excellent, that is why I ordered another batch. Unfortunately ,my cat decided she did not want any more, she still has not finished the first order.
5;So many uses . . .;Not only in the kitchen, but makes beautiful bath salts for gifts as well.  Many aren't aware that different salts impart different flavors  to foods.
5;Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended!;"Huy Fong ""Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce"" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the boarder line for several of my friend."
5;The best iced tea ever.;Just wanted to share our opinion that this product makes the best iced tea ever.  The Passion Fruit flavor is subdued, but really brings the overall flavor up.
3;A little bitter;The product came on time. And overall tasted ok.
5;Highly Recommend This Product;These energy chews have a great flavor, will give you good energy before or during a workout, and are a reasonable price. I would recommend this to any endurance athlete such as a cyclist, runner, triathlete, etc.
3;A bit chalky;These oats are edible but a bit chalky.  Maybe I would have liked them better if I hadn't tried the McCann oats first.
5;Dogs like it. I love that Amazon carries it...;I used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it. Then I was thrilled when I found it Wal-Mart, but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the Newman's doggie mush in cans.
2;just okay;I just thought I'd give these a try being all natural with such a short list of ingredients. Basically they are just okay.
5;This is a good deal;The cost breaks down to a dollare and oz and if your like me and love hops their is no guilt in adding more and dry hoppinig later..
5;Very nice surprise!;I waited until I ate at least one entire can before I reviewed this product. I bought a ten pack and it arrived quickly.
1;DON'T USE THIS VENDOR!!!!;Can't honestly rate this item, as it was shipped to me with some sort of unidentifiable dark brown, sticky substance all over the outside of the jar and was disposed of immediately. The product might be good quality, however after reading ratings from this vendor, I wouldn't put anything edible from them in my mouth, they are downright nasty and should be investigated.
5;sodium free seasoning;This is the best sodium free seasoning I have ever tasted.<br />I'm enjoying eggs and meat again.
5;Awesome Flavor!;Perfect drink for beginning morning or before retiring for the evening..
3;It does taste like sweet tea;I'm still a bit on the fence about this product. I can say that yes, it does actually taste like sweet tea.
5;I will Pay extra if this is My Rabbit;My backyard houses the fattest, best-fed rabbit in the world. Bunnykins has eaten dozens of costly perennials and organic veggies in my garden for the last year.
2;there is an aftertaste;This is the  third or forth brand of coconut water in cans that I have tasted .I dont know why coconut water in cans taste weird.
5;Husband of Pregnant Wife's Best Friend!;Helped tremendously with my wife's morning sickness during early days of pregnancy.  Was one of the only candies we could find that was not full of a bunch of artificial food coloring.
5;So happy to discover this mix!;I thought our days of having delicious grinders, Cuban midnight sandwiches, calzones and other treats were over when I found out that my children and I had celiac disease.  Not so!  You can make all kinds of goodies with this mix, and we keep it as a pantry staple.
5;Great for repotting;The shipping was fast, and the product description was accurate. First i was scared that there was not enough soil, but it seems that they put exactly the right quantity, no way of sparing some :p I highly recommend this product for beginners who want to repot a mame bonsai.
5;Dog approved;I fed these to a friends dog.  I really couldn't get much feedback from him as he was busy snarfing them down, but he seems to *really* like me now.
5;Surprisingly good!;This tea is fantastic!  It has a taste that reminds one of cranberries.  The picture is misleading.
5;Great Texture;This pasta is incredible. Never really could tell the difference between pastas prior to trying this.
5;Kitties Love This;We have eight cats - And they all love their kitty treats every night.  Thankyou Whiskas Temptations, our cats won't eat any other brand than yours.
5;The best good-for-you snack around.;My husband had high cholesteral, blood preasure and triglycerides. He went on a healthy diet, lost 21 pounds and ALL of his numbers came down to normal range.
1;Did Kraft discontinue thsi product in 2008?;I found this in my local Good Stuff Cheap store for $2.00, but since they're pretty careless (or underhanded) with expiration dates, I contacted Kraft for information on reading the expiration code.
2;24 hours of chewing and licking but wont buy again;Our lab received this for Christmas. She loved the toy carrying it around all day licking or chewing on the treat cap.
5;Newman's Own Special Blend Extra Bold K-Cups;I have ordered this product in the past.  I have never had any quality issues nor has there been any shipping or item packaging disparities.
4;Love popchips!;This is my least favorite flavor, I find it bland.  But these small bags are great for kids lunches, and a nice alternative to fattening chips.
2;not quite enough coffee per pod for advertised 8oz brew;the main issue with these pods would be that there's not quite enough coffe in one pod for the advertised 8oz brew of coffee.  they expect you to make an 8 oz brew with their single pod as opposed to 2 Senseo pods, which end up having significantly more coffee to brew from than their only slight larger single pod.
5;Yummy!;I love these cranberry/almond bars! They are delicious and best of all I know exactly what's in them. We eat these all the time for a snack.
2;Not really impressed;This product is definitely not for diabetics, or anyone watching their weight (which most cardiac patients are supposed to do).  It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving).
5;Tasty Brew;With my favorite brand no longer available, I decided to try the Coffee Bean Direct.  The dark house brew had a pleasing flavor, a hint of sweetness and no bitterness.
5;Changed His Picky Ways;I have 2 little rescued Miniature Poodles..
5;Delicious;I have loved sauerkraut and hot dogs since I was a child but didn't care for the intensity of<br />regular kraut anymore. Mixing the Bavarian Sauerkraut with regular makes the perfect<br />flavor.
5;Ocumare is amazing;I am not a dark chocolate guy, but after trying this i was hooked. These guys are not like most, they make their chocolate from the cacao from a specific field.
5;love these crackers;My daughter loves these crackers with some peanut butter on them. They do come in two small packages inside the box.
5;Incredibly tasty!!;..
5;Awesome deal!;My son didn't like his first taste of this, but once he got used to it he loved it.  Not sure how much better it is for him than the others, but the organic label got me to buy.
5;She's licking the bowl twice a day!!;"I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives."
5;My poodle loves them!;For some reason my miniature/toy poodle loves fishy foods (especially sneaking into the cats food), so I was excited to find these fish recipe sticks. Made in USA is a huge must for my dogs treats after the Chinese treat issues, and I was happy to find this company offers that.
3;Just okay.;They are okay, about half the chips in each bag were crunchy and juicy where the other half were just crunchy.<br />They do have corn syrup, though.
1;a terrible price on these!;Fuze is a great product. I can get it in my grocery store or at Target for a $1 / bottle on sale or $1.
5;Greenies are treats!;My dog loves these!  He has learned the word 'greenie'! It's good for him but he treats it like a favored treat.  I only use one a day, but he has accepted that and loves them.
1;expired date twice!;I actually love this product. Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.
3;Not my favorite;I am hooked on the Kashi Golean bars but this one is my least favorite of them. Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks.
5;Excellent product!;I have two 6 month old dobemans who asked me to rate Greenies 6 out of five. It is yet to be seen how it will improve their dental health, but as far as their excitement about this particular treat - it is the best, no doubt.
5;Happy Chihuahua;My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats).
5;Delicious & economical;I order this thinking it was a variety pack of 12 bars. I love these babies but find them very pricey (between $2 and $3) at the health food store.
4;a little bitter but ok;this is the least strong and bitter coffee I can find in k cups. I do not like strong coffee and this is the only one I can enjoy out of all that came in the variety pack that came with the coffee maker.
5;Starbucks does Keurig Right;The Veranda Blend is a medium blend and brews extremely well in the commercial grade Keurig I have at my office as well as the Keurig Breville I have at home. I love the larger count boxes that are available on Amazon that bring the per K-CUP costs down.
1;Total rip off;I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).
4;Dog Pill Joy;My dog loves both Chicken and beef.  Does not even notice her pill inside.
3;Makes you pucker, but tastes good.;I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.
1;did not like at all;our family did not leke thast at all. Din not atst lke figs.
5;Tasty;I love this tuff it taste so good and I put it in practically everything, but my favorite way to eat them is with vanilla yogurt and with my whole grain total ceral. I will buy some more as soon as I run out of this.
5;Top Quality Great for Dogs with Food Allergies;Natural Balance has been my first choice I dog food for 15 years because of quality ingredients- no corn or wheat fillers- and the price is reasonable for the quality. All of their products are good, but when my Corgi developed food allergies to chicken and lamb based dry kibble at 6 months, I switched her to the venison or bison and sweet potato formula and she hasn't had any problems since.
5;I LOVE these noodles!!!;These noodles are for anyone who is working to eat healthfully and loves pasta! They are delicious and make the best and only subsitute for regular pasta, so much so that there's nothing to miss but the extra calories! One whole bag of these noodles only have 40 calories. Give these noodles a try, and you won't be disappointed.
5;I love this stuff;This stuff is so delicious, I love it.  I've already ordered a second round of them.
3;Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green;I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste.
3;I wish i wouldve known;While this product DID increase my supply (i went from pumping around 9 oz (on both sides) to 17 in about 5 minutes) it RUINED my daughter. She was fine until i fed her the freshly pumped milk and she wouldnt drink over an ounce without fussing.
5;Yum;We had never tried red chips before and wasn't sure what we would be getting, we were pleasantly surprised. They have a great flavor and texture.
4;It tastes more like roasted garlic;I ordered it by accident and then decided to try it. It brings a good taste of garlic but not exactly like fresh garlic.
5;5 hour energy;I just started a new job, which is mornings, instead of the 2nd shift I worked for over 20 years, and am also taking classes for real estate..
5;Above the rest;Even if you don't know too much about cofee your senses will tell you that  the best coffee in the world has arrived. It' s the only coffee that with every sip takes you to a wonderfull world of enjoyment.
2;Not for outdoor use!  Really Havahart?;The product was easy to install and operate.  Some fiddling with the ground was needed to get a good circuit.
5;very happy;I bought this tea locally and loved it, however it was price prohibitive to by it in large quantities. I found the same tea in a large quantity  on amazon at an amazing price.
5;Beef Roll is beautiful;Both my dogs go crazy over this.  I originally bought it for treats but one of my dogs has decided she is not going to open her mouth for any reason whatsoever unless this is mixed in or is her treat.
5;Heaven sent.;Found this beauty while looking for something close to butterbeer. i can't begin to express how absolutely wonderful this root beer is.
5;Cool Gift - You Look Great Giving It !!!;Looking for a cool gift for someone special? Or maybe not so special, but you still need to preserve your reputation as a cutting-edge trend setter?  Take it from someone that had no idea that pasta was so..
5;the best tea;I never liked plain  green tea.  I thought I  would try  this white/ green tea combo.
2;Consistency issues?;I drink decaf coffee only occasionally, usually in the evenings.  The first time I purchased this coffee, I liked it very much.
5;I buy these every year;Two and a half years ago I was searching for unique, inexpensive stocking stuffer presents and I ordered these just because the label was attractive.  I was unexpectedly astonished by the superior qualities of these peanuts.
1;Gone down hill;When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame.
2;Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider;As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages.
4;Make your own cold green tea for a fraction of the cost!;I love cold tea but hate the price charged for bottled teas. I found that making my own with Lipton's Mandarin Orange variety tea bags is a perfect substitute.
5;Slightly pink in color, but salt non-the-less.;Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff.
1;WORST COOKIES EVER!!!!!!;Cookies are horrible!!!! Worst cookies I have had in my whole life, and I am not exaggerating. I opened one of the 8 boxes and tried to eat one.
5;Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts;Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.
5;Great Taste;Over the years, this chili powder has gotten harder to find. It has been a staple of our family's chili for decades, and I am very glad to be able to still purchase it.
5;Best Coffee Ever!;If you like vanilla flavored coffee, this is it!! I put a french vanilla creamer in and no other sweetner is needed. I have it every day and I'll always order ahead so I don't run out.
5;Feeling better;We heard about tart cherry juice on Dr. Oz as a natural safe tonic for arthritic pain, which my husband suffers from.
5;Great;Purchased thru Amazon, this solved problems I was having making bread in my Zojirushi bread machine, which I also purchased thru Amazon.com.
5;My Dogs Love These!;My little Jack Russell's just love these durable dental dinosaurs, I usually buy three at a time and they last three to four months. Great entertainment and my 3yr old dogs teeth are sparkling.
3;Not sure mail order is the way to go for these.;It was pretty hard to judge the quality of the cookies because of the condition they arrived in: several were smashed into crumbs and none of them were oriented correctly in the container. They had that oily look that cookies acquire when they've been overheated.
5;Well Worth It!;"It's hard to find products that are actually good for our dogs & their teeth but these are. What a plus to offer a ""low calorie"" dental bone."
3;Cooked rice is sticky;The cooked rice rice ends up on the sticky side.  If you want the cooked rice fluffy and light, this is not the item you want.
3;Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use;It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha.
5;Stash Tea;The tea is Premium quality as stated on the box.  I wish Amazon was carrying larger packages than the Box of 20 Tea Bags.
5;Great treats!;Our dogs love these. Our Golden has diagnosed grain specific allergies, and we have a challenging time finding acceptable gluten-free treats that are acceptable in taste.
4;Treats;My dog loved them. They didn't last very long.
3;love it but would love it more with less orange.;I love earths best and was excited to see this variety pack on amazon. We were doing the subscribe option but had to stop as this pack contains to much orange!I know it sounds strange but i like my dd to get a bot of variety and with only one green option the oranges (winter squash and sweet potato) were staking up and not being used.
5;BOLD AND FLAVORFUL!;This is my favorite decaf coffee.  It is bold and has an excellent taste.
4;Wow, it's worth the cost for tender white hulless;I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find.
5;Great Doggie Bags, Good Price!;I really like these bags because they are biodegradable and come in cute colors.  Plus, buying from Amazon was a bit cheaper than Petsmart.
1;Chia Seed;I read all of the good stuff associated with Chia Seed. My husband and I have been determined to eat healthier, and go organic when possible.
2;Wrong UPC/item number;I ordered this item and received Morning Rise instead of Ruby Chai.  The bar code on the bottom of the bag that says Morning rise is: 680692202205 and that is the same number in the discription/details of this item.
5;Thanks Mi-del;These are the best gluten free cookies ever.  If you have had the real thing before you won't know the difference.
5;Delightful cookies for the allergy plagued child;Delightfully delicious.  We had to restrict the non-allergic kids and adults from eating them.
2;Not a fan of the taste... tip: don't use the entire pouch for one cup;Of course any review for cacao will be subjective, so is mine:<br /><br />I simply do not like the taste of swiss miss (both the no sugar version as reviewed) as well as the regular version: it simply does not taste like chocolate when prepared with water. For those who prefer a chocolaty taste, I would recommend Nesquick prepared with milk.
5;The best I have used.;I was first introduced to Cytomax during a half-marathon in Nashville, Tennessee. I was impressed then by its performance and I continue to be 18 months later.
5;Chai Tea;I love Chai Tea Lattes from Starbucks and tried many kinds of Chai Tea bags at home.  Stash comes the closest.
2;definitely not Dilmah's best;so far i have bought the ran and meda watte varieties, as well as the supreme ceylon, several other Dilmah over the counter teas.<br /><br />this tea is more tannic and of lower quality than the dilmah ceylon i can get at our local indian grocery store.
2;Good - but not clean/ready for dog;The items came well packaged and in a timely manner.  I am giving it 2 stars because out of the package it had dirt and what smelled like animal excrement on it.
5;Healthy and high quality food that my cat loves;I got my kitten through a rescue group when he was about 7 months old. He had been a stray and was very thin, had bad breath, diarrhea, poor coat and missing hair on his ears.
4;Our dog loves these biscuits.;These biscuits have bran in them and seem to keep our dog regular.  Just make sure that your dog has plenty of water to drink with them.
5;Awesome;Lots of candy to enjoy at a low price. I found myself with no candy rather quickly.
5;My cats love this!;"My cats apparently LOVE the smell, taste and texture. Because THEY rate it so highly, I reserve this for a very ""special"" treat for my cats."
2;Look closely;My now 6 year old Chihuahua ate Cesar dog food for quite a while and seemed to really like it. But I got so tired of picking out BIG blood vessels that I couldn't stand to feed it to her anymore.
4;Not fabulous but gets the job done;Think its wonderful that there is such a product for diabetics. Unfortunately the flavor is definitely not equivalent to very good milk or dark chocolate (ie Godiva, Dove etc).
2;transfat cookies;I was very diappointed to find there were trans fats in these cookies.<br /><br />Ginger is one of my favorite flavors - however not trans fats.
5;Fabulous cooked with Almond Milk;I've been making this Tapioca Pudding for dinner parties where some guests are Vegan or Vegetarian.<br />I've substituted the water with Almond Milk (I like Almond Breeze) and also added the Coconut milk recommended.
5;Coconut Chai Green Tea is the best!;I have become addicted to Zhena's Gypsy Green Tea Coconut Chai! The flavors blend so well together, coconut, cinnamon, ginger, etc., is not overpowering and is so refreshing.
4;annies at our house;i was raised on Annies macaroni and cheese and now my husband is hooked!  he loves most of the flavors: The Bunny Pasta, Shells and White Cheddar, Arthur, Alfredo, you name it.  The peace pasta is best cooked for 8 minutes, maybe a tad more, because of it's shape it will fall apart if you overcook it.
5;Perfect for Espresso Drinkers Needing STRONG Coffee!!;I've suffered through having to always go get coffee out as my other half likes/needs the lower strength Donut Shop mild stuff, and I finally broke down and got me a case of 50 of these WONDEFUL Green Mountain Dark Magic K-cups.  THEY ARE PERFECT for someone that likes a strong, bold, delicious cup of coffee (and not that mild brown water some others drink)!  If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.
4;Convenient;Good coffee and the price wasn't bad.  This is a popular brand and flavor, it was great to be able to get this shipped and didn't have to hunt for it.
5;Great Puppy Food;"Our ""puppy"" (90lb Rhodesian Ridgeback) has been on Blue Buffalo since she came home with us from the breeder almost a year ago.  The Blue Buffalo brand is synonymous for quality in my opinion."
5;Instead of brushing~;Always had trouble trying to brush my dog's teeth
3;Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!;I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.
5;love this item;I purchased this item primarily to make my own babyfood combinations that were not available in the stores. I just made some stage 1 carrots and peas to get the hang of it.
1;Nutella Mess - Packets Leaked in Both Boxes. Ruined!;Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella.
5;Ok Food;I have used this food for 3 months, and at first I thought it was great. But have since taken all my dogs off of it.
5;good tea;Good tea. I don't drink tea, but these are enjoyed by my son and my father in law.
3;C O F F E E......I S N ' T......B A D..............B U T.......O H --- O H.....!;I can remember when SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE first came out.  It was cold, in those far-off cave-days, and we had to be wary of the occasional roaming saber-tooth tiger.
5;Mmmmmm, vanilla-y goodness;I second Joanna Daneman's observation that these golden Oreos are preferable to the regular chocolate Oreos when you are in public.  Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.
5;Healthy treats for kids;If you were to give your kids a treat, why not offer them the healthiest treat possible. I've found these lollipops are very tasty for both adults & children.
4;Tasty Organic Granola!;This organic is great for a quick snack. It is great mixed in yogurt or on ice cream.
5;Excellent value and quality;I will admit that I was worried about buying these after reading the review from the person whose pup became sick after eating four of these, but I decided to take the risk and carefully monitor my own pup.  My 3-month old Golden Retriever puppy came to me with giardia (for which he has been treated, but at the time, he was still experiencing some problems), so I didn't want anything to exacerbate his gastro issues.
3;good in coffee;I have just recently discovered Stevia (in powder), then I tried the liquid, then I tried this flavor.  I have to say this is pretty good.
5;I love this tea!;First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom.
5;Love this product works amazing!!!;I love this product, first it was supose to get here between the 5 and 20th which made me mad, but it actually got here on the 3rd. So that was awsome!!!! Also some people say that its to thin to paint with, not at all it paints amazing!!  Looks great works great and came fast, in one word.
5;Had never heard...;..
5;Best ever for making Red;This is the only product I use to make cake/icing red when decorating cakes.  I bought this product because a friend recommended it.
5;Great for the Lazy!!!;This wheatgrass grows itself. I load a shallow tray with dirt, add fertilizer, fill it with seeds, lightly cover with more dirt,water and thick wheatgrass in 7 days.
1;New reduced juices from 70 to 50% and now 10% YUK!;We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared.
4;An Awesome Twist on a Thanksgiving Favorite!;I ..
2;Keep fusing;Unpleasant aftertaste, I bought this hoping I would enjoy it. Amazon had a great price.
5;Both my 5 yr old son and I love them.;Hard to find products that my son's diet allows him to eat.  This is a great treat.
5;Absolutely the best milk chocolate covered macadamia I've had.;Looking for a chocolate nutty taste? This is for you! Reminds me of Hazelnuts but with the distinct crunch you get from macadamia nuts. Always a good decision.
5;Best chips on the market;How often do you eat a parsnip? Well, I don't make the opportunity very often, so I'm thrilled to see parsnips in my fancy black snack-chip bag. Vastly superior to corn or standard potato chips.
1;Weird mixes, baby didn't like a lot of these;I'm not sure what I expected with canned finely ground beef in the first place, but my 9 mo didn't like most of these mixes. I had to blend with other things and she still barely ate it.
4;Scarpetta Tomato and Artichoke Bruschetta Topping;I first had bruschetta at a house warming. I was stunned by how fantastic it was.
1;Never again;I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.
5;amazon is very efficient;These liquorice mints are wonderful. Amazon.
5;Yummy!;This tea rocks! I tried it first at work and before long, so did everyone else and they have YET to restock our shelves with this, thus, me coming to Amazon.com and buying in bulk for myself and everyone else who pitched in to ensure they had some too.
5;Tasty, healthy goji berries for an excellent price;These goji berries are quite tasty and chewy.  The price is very reasonable considering they are organic.
3;Somewhat disappointing;"Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name ""Wolfgang Puck"", I expect to be impressed."
4;Nice little item;The silicone top on the one I received was misshapen from being loose in the box. When you shut it, it did not close evenly, leaving gaps on either side.
4;Great Single Protein Food & Grainfree;My dogs love the Pinnacle brand (but honestly, they ain't the pickiest doggies) and the price is very competitive, with the free ship.  If you're trying to keep your dog on a single protein for allergy reasons, this food fits the bill.
5;Bread baked perfectly with barley mix;Like other hodgson bread mix. I tried this one in zojirushi bread machine and it came out perfectly baked like a regular bread shape.
5;Tahini;The tahini is great. I've used it already to make hummus twice and also found a tasty recipe for tahini cookies that I tried and loved (very lo-cal, no flour).
4;A really good coffee;Very rich and flavorful coffee.  I like the pods without the plastic case.
5;Yummy Straw Mushrooms;I like Roland products in general, and these mushrooms are no exception. Large whole straw mushrooms at a reasonable cost.
5;Sugar Twin;I was not able to find this item in any of my stores locally.<br />I went on line and found it at Amazon, and was happy to see it and know were I could get more! I am a Diabetic, and I use this all the time.
5;Wonderful stuff;This is the first time I've tried any coconut oil, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I really, really like this stuff. It lives up to all the hype, and I assume it's as good for me as everyone says.
5;Calm it works!;I have used this before, it keeps me from getting leg cramps. I have used it for several years.
5;Hazelnut coffee;This is my favorite coffee from Gloria Jean's..
5;marv, seven hills;im lovin the grits. iv never eaten them before and a friend came back from states and i asked him to bring me a box and ive been hooked on them ever since.
3;Great no caffine tea...but;It is difficult to find. I do not know how many boxes you get from Amazon, but the price is over 100.
2;Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast;I wanted to like this..
5;Great tea;I drank this tea when my baby started to sleep through the night however I could not sleep. I love the way it relaxed me.
5;Very nice matcha;Very smooth tea. Can drink plain.
5;My family is obsessed with these pretzels!  If you like chocolate, caramel and pretzels - this is your holy grail!;I bought these on a whim because they were on sale on Amazon one day and I am SO glad that I did.  My family and I love chocolate, caramel and pretzels and this is the perfect mix of those flavors in a crunchy, salty-sweet treat.
5;Great taste and very filling!;I have really enjoyed the Cherry Bar by Larabar. There is NO added sugar at all - just dried fruit and almonds.
5;Brothers dried fruit packs;Wow!  We were pleasantly surprised by this product.  We love to eat dried fruit, and the handy packs were great for an on the run treat.
5;best dog food I've found;Since using this product my dogs coat has improved soooooo much.  He loves it.
4;Bel Paese Cheese Medallions;Bel Paese Cheese is an excellent soft Italian cream cheese.  These medallions arrived in excellent condition and were allowed to rest for a day under refrigeration.
5;Delicious & very healthful.;This is by far my favorite breakfast cereal on the market.  I was introduced  to it about 20 years ago when my doctor recommended it to me as part of a program to lose weight and get my blood pressure down.
5;My Dogs Love It!;"With one dog who'll eat anything and another who's quite finicky it was good to find something they both liked.  Not a ""stand alone"" food, it's meant to be mixed with kibble for a complete diet."
5;Bite sized heaven for your dog - good value per pound;This Zuke chicken flavored mini naturals dog treat bag is natural, my labrador puppy loves them, and it's a good portion. I bought this for about $6.
4;Not as healthy as plain raisin bran, but sure tastes good!;A quick glance at the nutrition panel will show that this has less fiber but more sugar than regular raisin bran. But, the taste makes it worth it - very crunchy, plump raisins, a real treat! My only criticism is that it is a bit too sweet.
1;Outageous Shipping Charges!;I purchased this item in good faith from an Amazon seller thinking I would be getting a reasonable savings. The outrageous shipping charges of $29.
5;Good Taste;Good flavor and a great carob.  I like that extra nutrients are saved from it being raw.
4;Yum.;Like that is it organic, don't like that it comes in plastic containers.  Earth's Best was always our first choice, but Gerber Organics comes a close second.
5;Great Rice;This is the best in-between rice
5;Fast , Fresh and Tasty;Wow, I order it Tuesday in the AM and it shows up Thursday afternoon with free shipping! I was worried about ordering food items from Amazon, that it would come in melted and all stuck together because of the 90+ degree heat here in Florida. But no the bag was cool to the touch.
1;where's the tripe;My dogs go nuts for tripe, so I thought this would be an easy way to give them what they love in biscuit form. I was not impressed nor were they.
4;Nutiva Coconut Oil - change in bottling?;I was happy with the quick delivery time of this product.  I ordered one bottle last month, and was pleased enough that I ordered three more.
5;great;A tasty & healthy desk snack, will tame a sweet tooth.<br />My box at home is kept where my 2 year old granddaughter can get at it and she seems to find it yummy as well.
1;Strange Taste;I've eaten Mapo tofu in China and the US. This sauce is nothing like I've ever tasted, in the worst way possible.
5;Super Easy taste great,;This Wholesome White Bread Mix by Hodgson Mill Is the easiest bread mix there is. Not that any of them are two hard, but all you need for this one is Water and Butter (or Vegetable Oil) and the Mix, witch also comes with a packet of Yeast.
5;KITTY TREATS...WOW!!!;I don't know what the attraction is in these treats, but my cats go crazy for them. They will search for the<br />open container and remove the cap & help themselves.
5;popcorn lovers gift;Got this for my boyfriend's brother and he loved it because he consumes a lot of popcorn.  It's a nice variety of flavors and the packaging is convenient.
4;Nice flavor;I really like this product. The flavor is good and it does seem to boost my energy level.
4;I like it..;I like Banana Nut flavor in Cheerios. More than that, I like Honey Bunches of Oats.
3;wish for Gloria Jean's flavored decaf coffee;i love this coffee, it's my favorite however it doesn't come in decaf and i can only drink so much caffine without the side effects. please come out with decaf, we love coffee too.
4;My dog loves these and they last forever!;I bought these products at Petsmart on sale and I thought these would be great for my lab mix for treats and training purposes.  He loves these!  They have lasted me quite some time, due to treat rotations, and come in a resealable bag.
3;don't bother, it's just ok;get millstone's 100% colombian, it's better.  this, and all, kona blends have an insignificant amount of kona in them, don't bother.
5;Great, high quality food;I will no longer feed my dog(s) standard grocery store foods though I did have a cocker spaniel live almost 17 years mostly on that before I knew better. This is a very good food.
5;Delightful;This wonderful organic tea is a delight. Perfect peppermint taste and oh so yummy especially near bedtime (no caffeine!).
5;PB2 really does taste like peanut butter;85% less fat - a bit too good to be true? Couldn't find this on the shelves in Canada.  Been searching for it since first showcased on the Dr.
5;Our dog LOVES them;Our dog loves all of the Newman's Own treats, but I think Peanut Butter is her favorite. The small size is perfect for our large dog and works well as a training treat, or bribe to get her to come inside.
5;Cornbread Mix is Excellent;"My sister sent me one package of this Martha White ""Sweet Yellow Cornbread and Muffin Mix"". I did not cook it for several months but finally got around to it."
3;Good, just good;The package arrive with the seals broken, but in a plastic sealed bag, so kinda strange..
1;Tastes like Chemicals;I am a HUGE Vita Coco fan. I drink it almost ever day.
1;Not the product in the picture;You can order this gum, but you will receive React 2 - which is terrible! The original React holds its flavor for hours, but the React 2 loses the fruitiness after a short period of time. I wrote a complaint to the seller, but did not hear anything back.
1;Tastes like plastic-YUCK!;Have purchased this product in different cities from different stores.  The consistent thing?  It tastes like plastic.
3;Good quality, but ultimately it depends on the cat's personality;I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it.
5;Rich, mellow flavor;
5;Crazy cups decaf sampler;A nice variety of decaf coffee's.  Good opportunity to sample different producers products for future purchases.
5;Excellent Dog Food;After trying several quality dog food brands we discovered Wellness Grain-Free CORE Original.  Both Golden Retriever and Welsh Springer Spaniel love and thrive on this food with no weight gains, itching or allergies.
5;Great sale;I received everything as described.  This is delicious milk.
5;YUMMY!!;Good Healthy Pancakes.  Just delicious !!  My family loves these.
1;No smell as French Roast;I bought these Pack of 3 in June. It was grate taste.
2;Good idea, but ingredients differ from what the Amazon web page says;This appeared to me to be an ideal product--providing a little bit of fruit flavor and also vitamin C to water--a variant on my habit of adding a little juice to drinking water (which does encourage more drinking, a good thing particularly in the summertime).  Unfortunately, the ingredients on the bottle I received differ from what's listed on the Amazon web page, and include taurine, which is animal-derived.
5;Excellent flavor;Great tasting.  Not too sure if the price is a deal compared to the grocery stores.
5;We LOVE these!;My 2-yr-old son has been eating HappyFamily products consistently for over 6 months now and this packet is one of his favorites by far. I'm so glad we can throw these in the car for last-minute snacks (my son has thankfully never seen a drive-thru thanks to HappyFamily packets).
5;Popcorn Heaven!;What a great product!  So simple to use plus all the flavor of the movie theater for a fraction of the cost.  Great when watching those football games on your big screen as well.
5;Yummy!;I don't need to say much more, these are good. Not really hot like you might assume given that it's jalapeno flavor.
4;Great Item;I purchased this when I was planning to make and freeze baby food for my daughter. What I like about them is that they are easy to pop after food is frozen, unlike regular ice trays.
3;Very Dry, but They Still Taste OK;I was so excited to get a good deal on raw gogi berries. They are usually $15 a lb or more.
5;Delicious Quick Easy Snack;I have tried my share of the snack/breakfast bars because I am so busy I am always looking for an easy quick meal..
5;FANTASTIC;Bought these for my 15 month old and he LOVES them.  It's nice having a savory snack as most of them tend to be on the sweeter side.
3;Something strange;I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients.
5;Awesome butter cookies!!!;These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet.
1;brand is good but packaging from this seller is bad.;Something is wrong with the packaging. The pizza crust was horribly smelly, slimy packaging and inedible crust.
5;Good for dogs on raw diet;My doggies eagerly look forward to their 'Biscuits' every day.  We feed raw turkey and chicken and these are used as a treat.
5;I does work...;I must say that I bought this product with no much hope for it to work, but I really help to relax my muscles actually I use it even for the times that I felt like I was going to be sick and it helps a lot. if you are seriously stress and have constant pain well you may need something stronger but for general discomfort this is a good way to go.
1;Weak and Bitter;terrible swill.  I can't belive this is from the company that WANTS to sell you their coffee maker.
5;yummy chips;These chips are so good you can't eat just one, at least I can't.  They are made from sweet potatoes and coated with a light sweet glaze.
5;Absolutely Delicious!;My Mother bought this a few months ago and it is by far the tastiest and most memorable pasta sauce I have ever had! It is so good that I just HAD to come online and share my thoughts about it with others. I definitely agree with 'booklover79' that many times, companies that make sauces seem to make them without vegetarians/vegans in mind.
5;Teenie Weenie;My dog loves this treat. It helps clean his teeth daily since brushing is not an option because he dislikes it.
5;Great Organic Pear Juice;I recently ordered Knudsen organic pear juice for my 20 month-old son. He really enjoys it.
2;Not as fresh;This is the second time I ordered this product within one year. The FIRST time I ordered it, the cheesesticks were fresh, crisp, and tasty, just as I've always liked them, and I was very pleased.
4;Good vanilla;"This vanilla is really good and I like using it in my baking.  Since I largely bake gluten free, I use a lot of vanilla (these recipes call for more than ""regular"" recipes) and it gives the baked goods a good taste."
5;Great buy, my dogs are addicted to Greenies.;This is a great buy, I was paying over twice as much for a box of them. All three of my Poms love Greenies, and expect them every morning.
5;Chokecherry Jelly memories of childhood;I purchased Chokecherry jelly at Amazon.com.
5;Chicken and Beef;I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them.
3;Not the best trap around.;This company made some very interesting choices. They put the pheromone bait in a special tiny square of plastic that you have to drop onto the actual sticky surface.
5;Terrific chip!;Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now.
4;Not as anticipated, but I like them anyway.;Hi. I had to amend a previous review for this item because I only gave it 2 stars back in July 27, 2009.
1;Worst Hot chocolate ever!;"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less."
4;Delicious;Very strong looking, but the taste is pretty mellow. It's not as caffeinated as regular French roast coffee (because of the chicory mixed in).
4;Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.;I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks.
5;Very good tea;Very good tea. Good value for money.
5;Great gel at a good price.;I use these every bike ride. They taste pretty good and give me energy.
3;great product, but ....;This is my favorite balsamic vinegar. I read about this brand in cooks illustrated in their comparison, so I decided to check it out.
5;Fresh with good color.;Turmeric supposedly reduces inflammation so I add it whenever possible. Its a good buy here, and fresh.
2;Bought for sprouting but they refused to sprout;The Amaranth we wanted to sprout then dry the sprouts, grind to flour, add them to our sprouted wheat flour, to add extra protein to our sprouted whole wheat bread.  We tried and tried but they refused to sprout.
3;good deal but watch expiration dates.;I give it 5 stars for value. But 2 stars for expiration.
5;Nature's Hollow Strawberry Jam;I love this jam! It does not taste sugar free. I no longer eat any other jam.
5;Whole Wheat Bread Mix;"The Hodgson Mill Honey Whole Wheat Bread Mix is a excellent product. In fact most of the Hodgson Mill ""whole grain"" products are very good."
5;great taste!;These by far are the best tasting gluten free bars ever and at a very reasonable price. Low in calorie and a great after work out snack.
5;Expensive, but my cat is thriving on it;I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems:  excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain.  I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.
5;Sour cream powder and Chedder cheese powder;I have made purchases from Berry Farms twice now and both times they have dilivered before the due date, usualy within a day or two.  The products are as advertised, and are real good for putting up for desaster storage.
1;Made my dog ill.;Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken. Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it.
5;Satisfying!;This is hands down the best Chai that I have ever tasted.  It has a rich creamy vanilla taste that satisfys every time.
5;What a difference!;My PMS has gradually worsened over the last several years to the point where I really only have one good week a month. I was desperate for something to help control mood swings, breast tenderness, etc.
2;Brighter But Expensive;I have been buying CF bulbs for many years. 100 watt equivalent bulbs typically use 23 watts, put out 1600 lumens of light and a 4-pack costs about $8 ($2 each).
3;Very mild, too mild for me actually.;I usually order the French Roast, which is actually a fantastic coffee for our taste buds! No one in the family liked this weaker roast. Keep in mind we tend to like darker roasts and coffee that with taste to it! Thanks, hope this helps.
4;INCONSISTENT RESULTS;MAY 2012 UPDATE! Once again, every loaf has turned out differently.  I followed the directions to the letter but it turns out differently every time.
5;Kids love them and can't keep them in stock!;I like these the best out of all the cheese crackers marketed to kids. The ingredients seem to very decent and my kids love the taste.
5;One of the best hot chili sauce!;"Googled ""best hot/chili sauce in the US"" the other day and Huy Fong Sriracha popped up. I read that this brand is one of the best hot chili sauce so I figured I would give it a try."
5;easy coffee;I like just dropping the filter pack (or two or three)in my coffee pot, filling the water chamber..
5;K-Cup coffee Purchassed from Amazon.com;Caribou coffee daybreak morning is a mild coffee for those that do not want a strong first cup of coffee. Good purchase for lite coffee drinkers.
4;Good for you but doesn't last long;I like Spry because I know it's good for me, but the gum size is meager, and the flavor, while good, doesn't last long. So I pop in two pieces at a time and just enjoy it while I can.
5;Happy whiskers and two paws way up!;*Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet.
5;Good Buy for Good Coffee;This is a good coffee at a good price.  If you drink alot of coffee (like I do), it makes sense to buy a larger bag like this.
4;Riceworks Salsa Fresca Chips;The chips are delicious!! I absolutely love them. They are very addicting.
3;Alvita Tea;The Alvita tea is not very tasty. But it does pack a punch of benefits.
5;Great alternative to real peanut butter!;I use this all the time in my smoothies and protein shakes.  It gives it a great peanut butter flavor without all the fat and calorie content.
4;Origonal;The best I can say is that the taste is quite origonal and unique.If you want the best and dont mind paying fot it then this is for you.
5;Great sized treat for training;I use treats for obedience and agility classes.  I need a treat that is not crunchy, but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits.
5;Excellent Product;Due to health issues, I have a constant problem with constipation. Just one cup of this, each day, assists me in a 'natural way' (no strain/pain).
2;Does not taste like Peanut Butter and Chocolate;What first caught my attention of these bars were that they were vegan and soy free.  I have been trying to stay away from so much soy so I thought these bars would be a nice change of pace.
5;Good for your health;Coconut oil is a supplement everyone could add to their diet.  It has given my husband more energy and he no longer drinks 32 oz.
3;Average Oatmeal;"I see that there are a lot of reviews complaining that there is a new recipe for this product and that it's not as good as the old one. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the ""old"" recipe so I can't make a comparison."
5;Great - My family loves these!!!!;My kids love these (ages 15 & 12). One of my kids doesn't really like apples and she loves these.
5;the real deal.;My daughter fell in love with this in Chile and we were unable to find it in the local grocery store.  She loves it more than regular hot chocolate.
5;So tasty!;I stumbled across these while perusing Amazon's grocery section. They sounded very interesting, but despite the rave reviews I wasn't ready to commit to 12 bags.
5;Convenience of buying by the case;Excellent item (both kitten flavors) to have on subscribe and save!  Great price, case availability, and fast shipping. That is why we order eight different flavors of Fancy Feast.
2;Disappointed;I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.
4;Good but not exceptional, A super + for making it for bread machine;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;good flavor;I normally like a much darker and oilier bean but this has a great, mellow(in my book), almost chocolaty flavor..
2;Not as good as the Soulistic in Gelee;"Having purchased the Soulistic ""Gelee"" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the ""Gravy"" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans."
4;Good Sampling of Espresso Pods;This was a good sample of different types of pods, although I am not sure I can tell them apart in a blind tasting.  There are definitely differences in the brands - I do like some better than others, but overall are all pretty good.
3;OK but not great;"I had high expectations for this coffee, a fan that I am of African blends. It is very drinkable, but it has a mildly ""musty"" and bland flavor."
5;Great Product!;These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister's baby shower.
5;Hi-Tek Naturals;My dogs enjoy this high quality food. Read about the ingredients, they are the best! No digestive problems, happy healthy dogs.
5;Purple Jordan Almonds;I purchased the almonds for a bridal shower and they were perfect and delicious. They were the perfect addition to the shower.
1;Very Slow;I was very disappointed with the delivery of the chocolates. I ordered them on July 31 and they did not come until August 12 (after their expected delivery date).
5;Good price and fast shipping;I am happy with the service of this company.  Fast shipping and great communication.
4;My dog loves them.  The only concern I have is the best buy date.  If you only buy a bag at a time no problem.;The only concern I have is the best by date.  If you only buy a bag at a time no problem.
5;Berni;This yeast is working just like that which I bought at the store, but at a way lower price. 2 tsp.
1;Kind of Gross;I bought this soup in the store and as a HUGE fan of Tom Kah soup and Amy's products, I was seriously disappointed with this version. The broth is not as flavorful as the Tom Kah soups I've had before, and the tofu is kind of hard/rough so the textures do not meld well.
4;Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?;These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too.
4;1st Review Written By Employee;If you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the 1st review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature. I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted.
5;Yummiest dark chocolate I've ever found!;I first tried Ritter Sport Fine Extra Dark at an airport in Amsterdam. It was smooth, almost creamy, not chalky like some dark chocolates.
5;Love the taste!;My family is a big fan of the Health Warrior Chia bars.  This particular flavor is my all time favorite, and I have tried all 3 flavors (chocolate peanut butter, and coconut).
5;Love this water!;I have tried many brands of bottled water and this is certainly my favorite.  It has a clean and pure taste and I will continue to buy it.
5;Tastes Great on Pork, Beef, and Chicken!!;This is my prime seasoning for not only pork dishes, but, beef and chicken as well. I bought this seasoning to try something new for BBQ dishes beyond the typical rubs.
5;Love this stuff!;I use this product a lot. I cook brown rice in Washingtons instead of water, so that it has taste!  I only use one envelope to two cups of water, so as not to add too much sodium.
5;Great snack bar!;I have tried a variety of the Larabar Food Bars, and this is one of my favorites.  It is a very tart cherry flavor
5;My dog loves these;My dog really likes the Booda Bones.  I just ordered the peanut butter flavor in a single bone because I wasn't sure he'd like them, but he really liked the flavor.
1;Not so great..Expiration date soon..;I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However.
5;Quick, yet delicious!;This mix is one of the better I've used.  Mixes well and there isn't a grainy texture.
3;Just blah....;Blah..
4;Pretty decent;I am from Trinidad in the Caribbean and ordered this item thru my skybox. After reading all the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a variety pack.
5;COFFEE..YUM;FOLGERS GOURMET SUPREME IS THE BEST TASTING COFFEE OUT THERE!!<br />USE YOUR COFFE-MATE CREAMER..
5;Delicious!;This is my favorite flavor!  I am not a diabetic or and athlete, but I do like to eat healthy.  They are great for a quick breakfast with a cup of tea or an afternoon snack.
2;Buttery? Maybe... Garlic? Possibly... Lemon? None at all!;I am rather disappointed in Knorr's three new additions to the noodle line. I am a huge fan of Knorr and have been eating their noodles since I was a child.
5;Good Stuff;This is a wonderful item.  I have used it on both boneless and bone-in chicken.
5;My favorite of the St. Dalfour line;The nutritional information listed above is correct except for the sodium. My can has only 300 mg sodium per serving (13%) or 600 mg for the can (26%).
5;Excellent product!;Best dog food out there!  Good ingredients and my dog loves it.  We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
5;Distance Runner in Love!;As a marathon runner and lover of long distance, I've found my match. Lemon-lime Jelly Belly Sport Beans are really one of the best electrolyte products.
5;only thing she'll eat;I have a finicky Brussels Griffon. After spending $$$ on 30 pound bag on another brand, which she hated, I finally purchased samples of dog foods and put them in bowls to see which one she would eat.
5;My Favorite Granola;This wonderful organic granola has become my favorite granola. It is just perfectly crunchy and goes well with milk or can be sprinkled on top of yogurt.
5;Hawii Roaster Kona is the real deal;I have been a big fan of their Kona for years, long before they were on Amazon.  The bean are always fresh on arrival and competitively priced for coffee from the Kona Districts.
5;Best non-whey non-soy alternative;Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.
1;NOT WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY;I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE BUSTELO ESPRESSO REGULAR, AND STILL DO. I FIND VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN TASTE BETWEEN THE BUSTELO PREMIUM AND THE REGULAR TO MERIT THE EXTRA COST.
5;Tasty Tasty Tasty;These little gummies are very tasty (as you can tell by the title) I bought them right before I left for college and they were gone from my room within a couple of days. I've been looking for them ever since and just now found them.
3;it's OKAY;I had this coffee at our local country club.  (I was a guest!)  Then my employer started using it.
5;Hard Salami Lover;Use to pick up at the market but couldn't fin.  Ordered on line , had quick delivery and the Salami is the same great product.
4;Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy;First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull.
5;All gone!;My doggie ate these up! He loved them. I like that they were mini, so I didn't have to worry about breaking them up or my dog getting too many treats when he was going through his training stages.
1;Two paws down;Day One: Treats devoured with alacrity by our two, treat-loving, non-finicky felines.<br />Day Two: Seemed to enjoy pretty well.
4;Good Tea - Overpriced though;This tea is very good.  However, it is overpriced.
3;its fine, but not at all like the drink;This is just fine as far as powdered drinks go. But it taste nothing like the actual bottle drink tasted.
2;Sweet;I bought a bar at a local health food store to try before purchasing a whole box. Glad I did, overpoweringly sweet.
4;Good gf cookies;These cookies are very tasty. A little bit dry (which is parr for gluten free).
5;Tetley is my favorite!;My favorite Tetley Decaffinated Green Tea has disappeared from my local grocery shelves.  I'm so glad to find it on Amazon, and in packs of six.
5;Quality and economy;You can't beat this. High quality and dark bold coffee with a subscribe and save price that is unbeatable.
5;foie gras at your door;I was a little concerned when I ordered foie gras through the internet.  It arrived frozen and when I prepared it the guests were delighted as was I.
3;Split household;My son really enjoys this flavor. He would write a different review.
1;Wouldn't buy again.;Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.
5;Great;My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.
5;VERY PLEASED;I eat popcorn most nights.  I use an air popper and a little melted butter (not marjarine or spread).
5;Good every day coffee;This coffee doesn't taste like decaf coffee.  And that is very unusual.
5;Totally tastes like the real thing!;"This tastes just like what you'd get from the store directly.  You just add water to (and I love these directions) ""3 heaping tablespoons""."
1;"New Formula contains ""Natural Flavors""";Our family used this for years and even despite food allergies, we were able to use this. Now the formula has changed.
5;Most delicious cereal I have ever tasted;"Krave Chocolate is the most delectable cereal I have ever eaten. It consists of multi grain ""pillows"" filled with a cocoa-tasting chocolate filling."
1;I found a long leg spider in the jar;When I opened this jar to make my morning espresso, I found a skinny long leg spider (dead) in it. It spoiled my appetite for everthing.
5;OMG WHAT A GREAT TOY!!!!!;I have three dogs.  A grouchy old schnauzer, and two English Springer Spaniels, one of whom is 10 month old puppy.
5;Great Tasting Treat!;I love these snack bars so much..
5;Excellent;I love 5hour Energy. It works just like it is advertised
1;Not received;This item was not received.  I just realized that when I received your request for an review.
5;Finally, something healthy and tasty;There are a ton of health drinks on the market that just do, but that's not the case with this aloe vera<br />drink. Seriously, it is the bomb.
3;not as strong as I'd like;After ordering British Blend Decaf tea for years, I ran across Bromley tea at a local eattery and decided to see if I could get thier decaf online..
5;My new favorite product!;I love the consistency of these flakes - less mushy than rolled oats. I add cinnamon,ground flaxseed,maple syrup and a handful of chopped walnuts.
1;Natural alcohol with some Rose in it.;Very very disappointed in this product.<br />Straight out of the bottle this 'extract' has a strong alcohol odor with a hint of Rose.
3;Happy but not thrilled.;"I purchased a single serve coffee maker that used the ""pod"" verses the K-Cup, because I thought it would be less expensive, and because I knew I could use 2 pods if I felt I wanted to make a stronger cup of coffee.  It turns out that it still wasn't strong enough for me, for the amount of coffee I drink."
5;The Best Canned Salsa they make;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Best Keurig Coffee;My friends say that I'm a coffee snob. Though, I admit that I drive out of my way for good coffee.
4;refreshing beverage;I love coconut and pineapple and couldn't resist picking up a small bottle when I visited my local co-op.  This is a thicker beverage - much thicker than other juices like apple.
4;Nice Taste, Good Company;This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine.
5;Deep, Rich Flavor and Family Owned Maple Farm;I love this maple syrup because it has a deep, rich flavor very wholesome tasting. How can people eat the artificial maple stuff from supermarkets?  There is no comparison between 100% maple syrup and the junk sold in supermarkets full of high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, additives.
4;Very Good Cashews;Good size jumbo cashews. Quality is better than most other cashews.
5;electric product;Works very well over a large area.  keeps animals and children in the yard that needs to be kept in and other animals and children out that need to be kept out.
4;A combination of juice and carbonation, 100% juice, no sugar, no artificial flavors;"I decided to try ""The Switch"" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first."
1;Sugar coated burned almonds!!;MEH!! How do people give this 5 stars? This is yucky. The only reason I decided to buy these is because few months back I bought honey roasted almonds from PLANTERS brand.
4;Might be working?;I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.
1;Does not clump;"I don't understand why this litter is called ""clumping litter"" - it does not clump.<br />Liquids are not clumped and the litter box becomes smelly."
4;Delicious rip-off;I have a personal problem with this product..
3;Great tasting, but primarily corn syrup;I used this when I lived in New England, but could never find it when I moved to CA.  Finally I came across this, and was stoked to have this again.
5;Just About Perfect;This is the first oatmeal cereal my 6 month old has been given and he really LOVES it. I drove my self crazy doing all kinds of research for a safe, BPA free cereal, then drove myself crazy looking at all the research on DHA, and so on.
5;pop chips;I love these chips.  They are not only diet friendly but they taste really good.
5;Awesome Coconut oil!;We normally buy Tropical Traditions, but this buy was too good to pass up.  The oil is just as good, and we use it a lot (frying eggs and baking).
5;Chicory helped me kick that nasty caffeine habit.;I quit coffee and tea in late March.  I started out using chamomile or herbal tea as a substitute, but it just didn't offer the same bitter kick that coffee has.
4;Healthy alternative;This is a great alternative to rice or pasta. I make a large batch every sunday and use it for lunch and dinner throughout the weak.
5;Yummy;These garbanzo beans are delicious I cook them in my crock pot, no fuss, and great quality dry beans. Dr.
5;Is what it ought to be.;It's ridiculously simple to make, making it a convenient way to grab a bite to eat when you are too busy to cook something, order out, go out, etc. for food.
4;Very tasty;Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner Kit is a tasty item to add to your dinner menu.  It is fast and easy to make, smooth and creamy and has a fresh, homemade flavor.
3;Why Different Packaging?;Oddly, the tea bag wrappers are paper instead of the usual foil used for the very same Stash tea when purchased in the supermarket.  We assume that this will have a negative bearing on tea leaf freshness.
1;Is this Pepsi pissed out of a God?;The price is ridiculous. I love Pepsi, but come on.
5;A wonderful alternative!!!;My 5 year old son has issues with milk.  He currently drinks rice milk instead of cows milk.
5;i love this stuff;i don't know what it is, but i can't get enough of this stuff.  in general, i wouldn't describe tuna helper or hamburger helper as being much better than ok.
2;Tastes healthy;Unlike many other reviewers of this product, I think nothing of pumping my body full of saturated fats, high-fructose corn syrup, or less-than-whole grains.  In fact the Back To Nature graham crackers landed right next to the Keebler ones in my pantry.
5;One of the best;"I have been though about 8 different varieties, and Cock N Bull Ginger Beer and Fever Tree Ginger Beer (don' get the ginger ale, it's good, but no pizzazz).  This stuff is ""ginger ale on steroids"", tastes great with a strong tingle."
1;Hazelnut flavor was way too strong;I read a previous review that complimented this hazelnut flavored coffee as having just the right amount of flavor.  I could not disagree more.
3;BEWARE!;BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon
5;Bronco Bob's Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce;Fabulous!  I bought this in California a few years ago and this is the 2nd time that I am purchasing on-line.  Great glaze for baked ham, with cream cheese, mixed with whole berry cranberry sauce for turkey and ham.
5;I have just received;this product and have taken two doses.  Other than tasting a little like grass the taste is better than what I thought it would be.
4;Great price for a good solid training size treat for allergic dogs;There are other treats that my dogs would do anything for..
5;Excellent twist on the fortune cookie;A coconut fortune cookie that tastes good and has intriguing words of wisdom?  Yes, they exist and you can buy them off Amazon.<br /><br />I happened upon these cookies in the international foods section of my local market.
1;"Not a ""Chew"", its more like a Jaw-breaker!";"I like Dogswell products and have purchased the ""Vitality"" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard."
5;preventing dental problems;The 'chewies' have been a great hit with our pomeranian, Toby, for several years.  They are part of his dental hygiene program and he loves them!  The price is unbeatable and a package of 30 is handier than the packages of 15 offered at his vet's.
5;Blue Horse Kona Coffee delivers.;Absolutley terrific coffee! All claims about its authenticity and taste are true!<br />I would buy this again without reservation.<br />Fast delivery and outstanding quality.
5;Great for all dogs!;Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip.  These had good recommendations so I purchased for him.
2;Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips;The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.
4;50/50 response from family cats;The quality of this cat food is excellent, with fish broth and the named fish (tuna, red snapper, sole, shrimp, or yellowfin) listed as the first (i.e.
4;Very good stuff;Very tasty, crunchy, lots of raisins and nuts, NO SUGAR! Excellent product. A good buy for anyone watching their sugar intake.
5;This cat food is great.;My four cats love Natural Balance dry indoor cat food and they are absolutely crazy about Natural Balance  canned cat food, Indoor formula.  I have one cat that likes it so much that she comes and stares at me at mealtimes.
5;Great stuff!;My cat really loves this stuff.  It is usually gone in a matter of 2 days.
5;A great gift;I bought this for my son, as a gift for Christmas. He and his wife are enjoying the variety, of the different liquers, and sharing it with friends.
5;Fantastically disgusting;These things actually taste like they are described. My girl was so fascinated at the idea of being able to eat candy like Harry Potter ate that she tried the vomit, earwax and soap flavors and giggled her way through every disgusting moment of the assault on her poor little taste buds.
4;Oh Henry!  You sweet boy!;It's very hard to find this terrific candy bar anymore.  Luckily, the internet comes in handy.
5;yum;Jacobs is delicious. definitely try it!<br />I have ordered it at the Philz here in San Francisco before and wanted to send some to my mom for her birthday.
5;Delicious, perfect snack size package, stays fresh;I love these cashews. They're Planters, so they taste great.
5;Good, strong cup of coffee;This is my daily morning cup of coffee.  I like strong coffee and this has become my favorite.
5;Tasty cereal;I really enjoyed this cereal.  The size is smaller than the normal mini-wheats, so they absorb milk much faster.
2;Cappucino Mix;Pretty good but somewhat too bitter.  What happened to the Coconut Mocha they used to make - that was the best but it contained sugar.
5;Great Gift - fast shipping;Ordered this for a Christmas gift just a few days ago and wasn't sure if it would make it to the recipient before Christmas (going Super Saver shipping via USPS). Just got a call that it arrived today in great condition and they are loving it - a wonderful variety of items that all taste good.
2;Did not care for this coconut water;Since O.N.
4;Overall I can't complain. Arigatou gozaimasu Noriko! :];Well, my shipment just came in today. It took a few weeks but it finally arrived! I was pleased when I looked inside and saw my Matcha kit kats, but sadly they were melty.
5;Perfect snack.;I absolutely love anything that has to do with cheese. I've always loved plain Quaker rice cakes, so when these tiny cheesy treats came out I knew I had to try them.
5;Best Value on Cayenne Pepper in the World;I buy this for my Step-Father and he uses it on everything.  It is GREAT Cayenne Pepper and this is the best price and value you can find any where.
5;Best Value if bought singlarly.;By this item as a single one just type in the number you would like.  Much better price than buying a case.
4;very best tomato paste, very little waste;I always keep a few tubes of this Mutti Tomato paste in my pantry. The flavor is a very fresh tasting robust tomato taste
5;now that's a cup of coffee;This coffee is one of the best choices for the Keurig Brewers. The amount that is shipped is almost ridiculous because there's so many cups there in those two boxes.
5;Can't live without it;My sister in law gave me a small bottle of this.  It was incredible.
5;Strong, Manly Coffee.;Great coffee.  There's no reason to spend $4 for a cup of coffee when you can get a great cup of strong coffee for about 40 cents.
3;Good, but not great.;TLDR version:  While a pretty decent bean (-1 star), this IS NOT A FRENCH ROAST (-1 star).  This is why it only gets 3 stars.
1;Horrible Artificial Flavor;This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.
5;Loved it!;I love this olive oil .  a nice aroma and full body taste .
3;Honey has a strang smell;This honey has a strange smell to me, almost like caramel that has been nearly burnt. I so wanted to try this but it came to me with the seal broken and had leaked all over the inside of the packaging.
5;Love them!  Perfect for training!;My puppy loves these!  They're small, moist and tasty - perfect for training and rewarding good behavior.  The chicken and peanut butter flavors are great too.
5;High quality tuna that's easier on my conscience;"I originally tried Wild Planet tuna back in 2006 when Amazon carried their ""minimal mercury"" products, and I was extremely impressed by the taste and the quality of the tuna.  I was never a fan of tuna in the past, but I thought their canned tuna was outstanding."
5;King Arthur Gluten free muffin mix.;GREAT product! My husband and I are new to Gluten free products.  These were so lite and fluffy!!  I added Walnut pieces and raisins.
3;Strong Liquorice flavor;A week after enjoying the mints, I had chest pains, and about the same time, FDA gave a warning of health hazards of liquorice root extracts. I have quit using Altoids Liquorice flavored mints.
5;yummy;yummy, but not really much cheaper then walmart. my 7 month old LOVES them and will eat them all day long, perfect because they disolve so quickly he won't choke.
5;Perfect prop for Breaking Bad Costume;I bought this product for my Breaking Bad Halloween costume. This stuff is pretty much dead on: it looks almost exactly like the blue meth from the show.
5;Dog loves them;I just received them today and my little weimaraner pup just LOVES the one she has now.  Yes.
5;A big hit with my two 3-year old felines. And a Google check okays its fat content;"Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer's warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says ""crude fat (min.) 34."
5;My Favorite cereal!!;Stores stopped carrying the cereal and Amazon picked it up..
4;Great litter box;This is a great litter box to have in a multi-cat household. It is extremely hardy and easy to clean.
5;delicious!;you won't go wrong buying these.  soft and juicy, great in salads, trail mix, cooking and less expensive than buying from the store.
5;Try it in tortilla soup or over rice.;My family loves Diced Chik!  And now, thanks to Amazon's Subscribe & Save, we'll always have them in our pantry.<br /><br />One of our favorite uses are with Emeril's tortilla soup recipe that you can find on Foodnetwork's website.
1;Waste of money;One word to describe this product..
1;Doesn't taste like anything;I bought this product based on the reviews. I usually drink Twinnings Spiced Chai but I wanted to try something that was more convenient than hot tea.
5;Made a great gift!;I bought this for my mom, a child of the 50s..
1;Not worth the price and not what I remembered!;"This was a big disappointment for me. I had long wanted to once again enjoy the ""energy sticks"" I remembered from my childhood, so I added one of these on to an order."
5;Only One;"I was introduced to this product about 8 years ago by a friend and it has been the ONLY popcorn in my house ever since.  I am unable to get it consistantly in my ""friendly"" neighborhood grocery store so I chose to buy it on line where I can get two cases if I want."
5;This thing is a Godsend;I own a 3 year old pemmy corgi and this thing is just the best thing since wet dogfood to him. If I put the ball with 2 treats in it in front of him, I know he is going to be busy for the next 2-3 hours just licking it.
5;Cat's favorite treat, good price..;My mom's elderly cats adore the Original Crunch favor of these treats but they are very difficult to find around here for less than $1.80 a pouch.
5;Best cannedtomatoes;Muir Glen canned tomatoes are a godsend during the winter months when fresh tomatoes look like cardboard and plastic.  They are full of flavor , even without added salt, and they make cooked dishes and soups even better.
5;Simply DDDDDDDDDDDelicious;They are just deliciously irresistible. Soft marshmallow on the inside with a thin layer of biscuit and quality chocolate on the top.
5;Hawaiian Hazelnut Always Out of Stock;The Hawaiian Hazelnut is my favorite K-Cup flavor from any vendor, but it's ALWAYS out of stock on Amazon.com
5;Good Greats, Good Quality, Good Product;This is a great product that most dogs absolutely love. It's great for the teeth and great for their morale.
5;Good balanced flavors;
5;Best price I could find;Amazon had the cheapest price I could find on a per-ounce basis.  I checked other online retailers and bricks-and-mortar stores including the warehouse clubs like Costco.
1;Horrible flavor!!!;I brought this item to work for lunch today..
5;as close to fresh vanilla bean as you can get;I buy this by the quart, so obviously, I LOVE it!<br /><br />I used to use vanilla beans exclusively.  I found this through a cooking school class.
1;Disgustingly Salty;I got the hickory smoked version and it's packed with salt. I know jerky tends to have a high salt content, but this is the first time it has ever bothered me while eating it.
4;W O U L D .....B E.....1 0.....S T A R S......I F......;"PORT SALUT ABBEY is truly scrumptious cheese! (Yum!).  I first got acquainted with Port Salut cheese years ago, when I was a member of ""CheeseLovers International""."
5;Eden Dried Cranberries;So happy to be able to find organic dried cranberries NOT sweetened with sugar.  The organic apple juice Eden uses instead of sugar gives the dried fruit a sweetness I did not expect.
5;My Favorite Tazo Tea;Tazo makes the best packaged tea in my opinion. I started with Earl Grey and Zen since they were both at my local grocery store.
5;Affordable and great tasting;I love hazelnut coffee and have tried many brands - Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is very good. I love being able to buy it in bulk for such a great price.
5;Pamper yourself.;Here's a generous supply of Bigelow Herbal Teas. Not a bad one in the bunch! If you've enjoyed Bigelow Herbal Tea before, you know this is a wonderful buy.
5;talkig rain;This is very good tasting sparkling water.I wasn't so sure I would like it, but it is very good.
5;Yum!;These are really great. You never know what to expect with gluten free products.
5;Scrumptious!;Just bought my first pouch today at my local Publix and they're already gone!  It's hard to describe what a treat these are with the combination of sweet and savory, salt, vanilla, and pomegranate flavors. I just wish it was an organic product, but flavor-wise, no complaints! The price on Amazon is 20% less than at my grocery store.
4;question;this is the catfood i regularly purchase -- and on the bag turkey is listed as the first ingredient. is the description on this sale mistaken or has it changed? thank you.
3;Too Thick;I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess.
5;Be careful, they are addicting.;If you like popcorn, you will like Pop Corners.  The sea salt is not overbearing.
4;Good green tea;This product was exactly as billed. Finding good decaf green tea is not easy.
5;Dog ate the rope, but this thing has endless possibilities!;This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible.
4;fine;It help clean the hard water out in my dishwater.  It did not work as good as I thought it would, but I am sure it had nothing to do with citric acid crystals.
5;Yummy Healthy Sensible Foods Snacks;These individual snack size bags are perfect for moms on the go.  A nutritious snack everyone can enjoy.
5;Wow;Very nice.  Very, very nice.
5;Really enjoy this tea!;I have found to really enjoy the flavor of this tea.<br />I would give it 4 1/2 stars.
5;Sprout Master trays;These sprouting trays are simply the best. With little effort I grow a wide variety of delicious and fresh sprouts in my kitchen.
5;Best Cookies Ever;My dogs go absolutely wild for the Blue Dog treats.  I get the assorted flavors, and there is not one that doesn't get inhaled.
5;hawaiian kona;love this coffee..
1;Surprisingly bad;It is so surprising that people who made Splenda Hazelnut Flavor did this one too. It has a bitter taste (in the bad sense) and a weird smell.
5;Makes your AVs flower all year round and lasts forever!;I'm amazed at the impact this has on my african violets (I've added a picture above). I was lazy for a couple of months and just watered them without the plant food.
3;Not bad;The coffee was okay, but it didn't have as much of a coconut flavor as I was hoping for. It was also just a little bit more bitter than I like.
1;Wrong picture;Buyer beware. The picture is of Simply Jif But What you get is regular Jif Creamy peanut butter.
5;Still the winner in our house;I keep trying k-cups that describe themselves as BOLD and being disappointed. This one truly lives up to that adjective.
5;Rich and Full;I agree that Black Tiger and Jet Fuel are strong and perhaps (to some people)bitter.  If you prefer light or medium blends, these are not for you.
5;Calm magnesium suppliment;An outstanding product, excellent value and the results are impressive. Blood pressure, stress and anxiety all much lower and energy much increased.
4;healthy-tasting crackers;Compared to other graham crackers, they are slightly more dry and slightly less sweet. They do have a heavy, substantial, oaty texture that I kind of liked - makes them feel like a breakfast food and not just an after-school snack.
5;Got a Sweet Tooth?;These cookies are not only good tasting but helps me stay on tract with my diet.  It is a little expensive but, I have lost 40lbs.
5;Senseo Breakfast Blend;The coffee was very, very good.  It was quite tasty, in fact I think I like it even better than any of their other blends.
5;Been looking for something like this for a long time.;I love these!!!!  I first tasted these at the Natural Foods Convention in Anaheim.  I've been waiting for these to come out ever since.
5;AWESOME!!!;It's final exam time and I read that trail mix, nuts and fruits, were good snacks to eat while studying. So I hopped on my bike and bought these at the store.
2;MESSY, MESSY, MESSY;My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.
2;Not great but will work in a hurry.;I was planning to make cupcakes from scratch with almond flour, but ran out of time so I tried this mix. It does not taste great to me.
4;Worked for my toddler;My milk protein sensitive daughter started out with the infant Gentlease and continued onto the toddler formula. She loves it.
1;not what customer reports said;After I read customer reports on 8 o'clock coffee I hoped to finally fine the best for me. No it is not.
5;great treat!;I sent the Baklava to my mother who is 90.  She and all of her friends just couldn't believe how good it was.
5;Quality and Flavour;"I'm not a tea snob, but I drink a lot of tea--this six pack lasts me about six months, and I get through a pound of English Breakfast each month--and I like a decent quality. Mostly, I don't like ""flavoured"" teas (can't handle Earl Grey), but this tea has a delicious smokey flavour that I really enjoy."
5;Refreshing delicious taste;This is my third purchase of the case of 12 and the flavors are cherry, grape, green apple, pineapple, and orange. In other words, there are no watermelon and raspberry.
5;greenies works;my cat has to take pills every day for the rest of his life. Greenies pill pockets are the best.
2;Small portion, not appetizing;The portion is really small.  It might work for a toddler.
5;Excellent Ghee;Nanak Ghee is of the highest quality and purity.  The company ships promptly and packs items carefully.
4;It must taste good;I just recently started buying this food for my 2 cats and I must say they really seem to enjoy it.  Even the chihuahua has been enjoying it much to the cats chagrin.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;Yum;This is the favorite tea of fictional character John Luke Picard of the Starship Enterprise (ie.Star Trek) and it is a favorite of mine!  Fragrant and earthy, this fabulous black tea always make as if a comfortable old chair is embraceing me.
5;My husband couldn't believe these were gluten free;I was daunted by the price a bit, but had a deal on another site for 50% off so I tried them. These are just like cookies, normal cookies.
3;Too watered down;When used right out of the can,and even mixed over dry food two of my dogs had loose stool. Right on the verge of being the runs.
3;This coffee is ok for the price;I'm not sure it is as decaffeinated as they pretend and it is kind of a regular black coffee with nothing special or particular flavor.<br />I got a 12 ounce can this week for $1.
2;Wasn't what I ordered;I ordered what I wanted in the picture, a bamboo plant in the shape of a heart. Instead, I got a different bamboo plant.
2;Lacks flavor and taste of Green Tea;I recently purchased this hoping it would be good. I love Green Tea and enjoy trying different varieties.
5;move over Starbucks;"During Christmas shopping I decided to try this new ""white chocolate"" drink.  It was unbelievable."
1;Worst Orange Soda Ever;They had this on special at a local market, so I thought I'd give it a try. The black licorice aftertaste was so powerful, it made it impossible to really taste anything else after the first sip.
5;Good;This is good dog food, but I stopped buying it, because one of my dogs (I have two) did not like it. She is not a big fan of can food in general.
5;Kettle Baked HIckory Honey BBQ---YUM!;My son will only eat these hickory honey baked chips from Kettle Baked. He says their taste can't be beat.
5;Delicious!;This coconut water tasted better than another brand I was buying a few years ago. We couldn't get it locally and were very glad to find it on Amazon.
3;Blood red cake;My 13 year old daughter made this cake mix over the weekend. It has a ridiculous amount of red food coloring in it.
5;ice box water;Product is expensive. Tasted very good! Shipping was a problem! I had to discard 4 of the cartons because they were all banged up and leaked all over the place! Nothing was done when I complained!  Would not buy again!  The product wasn't the problem.
4;A fairly tasty cheap thrill;In the past, I have absolutely hated pop tarts. I just couldn't imagine why someone would actually eat them.
5;Great for Paleo/Low Carb!!;I've tried almost all the flavors and the grape and fruit punch are the best. I am a crossfit trainer and people at the gym steal these from me all the time! Great if you are low or no carb diet like paleo/primal.
5;I like it;People have their opinion but I like it.  I add some Truvia to is and it's cool.
5;My dog loves the chicken nibs;The roasted chicken nibs is a great product and my dog just can`t get enough of it.  It is a great product.
5;Eagle Pack Anchovy;Papillon doggies love this food. Obviously great flavor, super ingredients, and a smaller kibble.
5;Yummy;Tasty almonds. I bought them as a preview for a gift and was hugely disappointed to see how they were shipped - they were in a bag and were put into a larger box so that when the post office handled the box, the product got knocked around and at least one third of the product was broken apart.
5;Great taste;I'm 66yrs old and have been using Bennett's for over thirty years. The taste is exceptional.
5;Great, Loved it but what happened to the price?;I purchased this coffee flavor for the summer when I drink less hot coffee. I love my dolce gusto coffee maker and have subscribed to receive several different coffees.
5;want more;I looked online and this item is out right-now and this is the only place i have found it in semi-bulk..
3;Peacock Brown Rice;My local Trader Joe's has a similar product so I was anxious to see how this would stack up.  It is very easy to make and perfect for the health conscious person who desires an alternative to rice or potatoes.
5;My Grandkids Love This and It's A Real BARGAIN Here;My grandkids always look for a 'treat' in Popaw's truck when they come over to our house. He always trys to keep something in there that they love and this is one of their favorite things to get.
5;Light, flavorful and crispy cracker;I have a gluten sensitivity so tried these crackers, what a find!  They are pricey but wonderful with all cheeses or by themselves.  I serve them when entertaining and guests always ask me the name of these crackers, and say they are going to get them because they are so good.
5;Great Deal;As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store.
1;Inedible;We recently tried two of LaChoy's stir fry sauces.  This is the orange ginger.
5;Excellent blend, one of my all-time favorites!;I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day.
2;Edible..;The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.
4;Mocha is best;This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion.  The French Vanilla is a second favorite.
1;Did not include Chocolate Supreme Flavor;This product does not ship with all of the flavors that were advertised. I received raspberry, mint, and french vanilla.
4;Yummmmmm;We've tried many scone mixes and have been happy with this one.  all you need to add is whipping cream, so its easy and the scones are good.
5;One of the best;By far one of the best tasting chocolate bars ever created.  Unfortunately I do not find it in most USA stores and when it is found it is usually the smaller version that is not as tasty.
5;Wonderful aroma, delicious taste;This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat.
5;sugar;My husband uses this sugar since he is a diabetic.  He likes it in his coffee and tea.
5;Christmas Gift.;I bought these for my wife for Christmas, I have no idea what they taste like because she inhaled them, I assume they were good.<br />Package arrived timely and in good shape.
5;K-Cups;Great product. Thanks! These have a wonderful flavor when you brew a cup of coffee.
4;small but good;This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
5;Delicious!;I am a subscribe and save customer. What can I say, my family and I love Andy Capp Hot Fries, umm, umm good.
1;NOT quite a Pasta/ Noodle Substitute;After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.
1;MADE IN CHINA;Read your labels, people!!! SMART bones are made in China!!!!!! A neighbor told me how great these were. After buying them, I read the fine print in the back.
2;Very Fishy After Taste;The snacks arrived very fast and in perfect condition. But, there is a very strong fishy after taste.
4;the best;mmmm  spaghetti classics from kraft..
5;Best Cuppa English Tea (In My Book);First off, I'll let it be known that I'm English.  That means I have spent my lifetime drinking lots and lots of tea, which I think is compulsory when you're English.
4;Yummy;My kids and I really like this flavor.  It is especially good in oatmeal.
4;Fine, But There's Better Out There;The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.
4;Great Tea;Stash Peach Tea is the best peach tea that we've found. For some reason it is always hard to find in OKC, it sells out as soon as it appears on the local store shelves.
3;Not somthing I would crave;These tasted like potatoe stix, that we got in grade school with our lunches usually on pizza day.  They were the bomb then, not so much now.
5;The best mustard I've ever had;"This is the best mustard I've ever had, the whole mustard seeds ""pop"" in your mouth and the flavor is I can only describe as smooth and warm. The previous reviewer mentioned caviar, and that's what the texture reminded me of."
5;Funky Monkey is fun;Great snack for the family.  Hard to get the little one to eat fruit and this is a fun way to introduce great flavors into snacking.
4;Good combination of  healthy ingredients;This granola is very fresh and tasty.  I liked the idea that it had walnuts, quinoa and chia seeds.
1;DIsgusting -- gave me an instant headache!;These are so gross I can't believe I wasted my money on them. They gave me an immediate migraine from the overwhelming artificial-smelling fragrance.
5;Recommended pesto;It's not cheap, but it is a great tasting pesto. A worthwhile splurge every once in awhile.
4;"Good oil, but raw foodists beware ""extra virgin"" is not the same as raw!";This oil is extra virgin, but not raw. It is cold-pressed, but the processing tempurature rises above that of truly raw foods.
5;Some of the finest tea in the world.;I am so delighted I found this great deal on amazon. I love this tea and the local stores that carried it charged the earth for it.
5;Fantastic taste!;I love using it in cocktails instead of cane syrup and on my pancakes..
1;Gnats all over my house from this product!;I bought 4 bags of this stuff and repotted everything in my house. Within a week I had gnats all over my house.
5;Unbelievable snack;I ordered these as a suggestion from the Hungry Girl Website, my husband and I Love them.  No nasty after taste, delicious and still healthy.
2;Dogs refused to eat it;"I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, ""We are NOT eating this stuff."
3;Doesn't taste like Diet Coke;This was my first time trying an at-home soda maker. I only drink diet soda, so I was really hoping this would taste like the real thing.
5;Phoenix Home & Garden taste test winner;I'm going to try these refried beans.  I just noticed in the March 2009 issue of Phoenix Home & Garden magazine, Amy's won the taste test over five other brands.
4;Good stuff at a great price;These are good granola bars.  We buy them at the grocery store but are way cheaper here.
5;Perfect for Brazilian Cheese Bread;I have a Brazilian exchange student this year and I bought this to make Easy Brazilian Cheese Bread ([..
5;A really delicious tea!!;This is a very enjoyable, refreshing tea with lemon and mint flavors. I think it's even a good dessert or snack tea.
2;Rancidity nearly knocked me off my feet and activated gag reflex;I know, I know, I should be grateful for anything I receive through Vine because I got it for FREE! I guess I do feel grateful to find out what doesn't work for me and my dog. My smiling UPS man delivered this PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.
1;Too expensive for something made in China;I bought this since I had similar freeze dried fruits from Costco, but is disappointed to see that's they are made in China. This means that the fruits are from China and so are the chemicals that were probably used to grow them, they are probably not as healthy as claimed.
4;Strong Ginger But It Works;If you don't like ginger then don't pick up a ginger drink, but if you like ginger then I do suggest Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage. It has a very intense ginger taste to it, much stronger ginger flavor then I was expecting and a very very mellow lemon flavor that is so mellow because the ginger just takes everything over.
5;Best bulk rate;These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones.
3;Tasty Snack, Poor Packaging...;When I first opened the box, I thought I had been sent an expired pack..
3;"Do they have to ""bite back""?";I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it.
5;Super filling bar;There are several things I like about this bar, but the most important thing is that it fills you up and you feel full for several hours. My favorite flavor is the caramel peanut.
5;LOVE IT!;I LOVE this stuff!<br />So good and good for you. I am not a big fan of salt and I didn't even notice salt on these little guys.
5;pretty good coffee;It's pretty good coffee.  I have bought the hazelnut one about 5 times now.
5;Delicious, bite sized treats!;I originally bought these to give my dogs as a nightly treat. When they arrived, I popped one in my mouth to see what they were like, and WOW, it was like this taste explosion of grease and flavor.
5;Excellent Product;Our somewhat ancient Hippo Hound (120 lb Mastiff / German Shepard cross) loves these.  She thinks they are treats and takes ANY type of tablet or capsule with them in a Pill Pocket.
5;So addictive...;I was buying these at a local gourmet cook shop until I found the lower price on Amazon.  I am freaking ADDICTED to these
5;super yummy sweet taste!;If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.
5;Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold;This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.
3;Good but too spicy for me...;Even though I did enjoy this item and the quality was fine, it was just a little too spicy for me to thoroughly enjoy it.  I might look for a less spicy version next time.
1;Coffee flavored water...;"I was excited to see this 50 pack of coffee! Read all about how ""if you like Dunkin Donuts, you'll love this"".  Well its not good at all."
3;Love the item not the price buy at the store for cheaper;We have only used this litter since we found it, However for the price of what you pay on amazon you can get two 20lb bottles for about 4 dollars less at most stores. These are very little bottles that most will probably go through within a few days.
5;Actually Tastes Great!!;My son loves eating these, it is very easy to make and convenient. I will make one for myself here and there.
5;Tasty Cookies;Very good product.  They are a tasty animal cookie with just the right sweetness.
3;Effectiveness is iffy...expensive for the amount provided..;This stuff sure smells spicy - black and hot pepper spicy.  It comes in a nice shaker and is considered organic.
3;Received mashed cereal pieces;Bought this item and a few other cereals a few weeks ago and half the box is tiny mashed up pieces and not enjoyable to eat. Would be a great deal if shipping item didn't cause half the cereal to be what you normally find on the very bottom of a box of cereal.
2;High Glycemic;If you've got sensitive blood sugar, DO NOT eat Kind bars. They are certainly not Kind.
4;More Sweet Potatoes, Please;Since they love all things potato and sweet potato, I knew the girls would like these snacks. They're a nice small size and thin in the middle so I thought it would be an easy thing to break the individual bones in half.
4;Is pretty good;This bread machine bread mix is not as good as a few others I have tried but Amazon does make it available for purchase which makes it a good choice. I wish Amazon would carry Eagle Mills white bread mix.
3;Great product but poor advertising on Amazon's part;Received the Petite Lite Greenies 27 oz box today.  The picture shows a count of 96 bones, but I only got a box of 45.
5;Lipton To Go Stix Black Tea Mix;I love the Lipton To Go Stix as it is such a convenient and fast way to have refreshing iced tea.  As a tea lover versus coffee lover, though I do drink coffee on occasion, it is nice to have this product on hand for a nice glass of iced tea and the flavor is delicious.
5;Awesome taste!;I have tried numerous protein bars and all have that lovely aftertaste like I just ate cardboard covered in multivitamins..
5;we never run out now!;We now are on auto ship for this coffee. we love it, that is the coffee and Amazon.
5;Good Coffee;Lost my supplier for Kirkland Coffee and thought it would be the end of starting my day with a great cup of coffee.  Thanks to Amazon I found my coffee again.
5;very tasty;This cereal product is delicious and is a nice change from so many gluten-free cereals that have a cinnamon flavor. I really liked the fact that it is a high-protein cereal, which helps to control blood sugar levels.
4;Yummy G/F Alternative!;First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite.
5;Great alternative to peanutbutter!;One of my children has life threatening peanut and tree nut allergies.  Hence, like many other families in the same situation, we had to explore other options.
5;Bunch of Munch;These delicious mini-crackers are small enough to grab a satisfying handful. Yep, it's got all the organic requisites, organically-fed cows whose lips never taste hormones or antibiotics (well, maybe these are injected, I don't know), and the crackers contain non-hydrogenated, trans-fat free organic palm oil.
5;The Best Wine Gums ever.I have tried every differetn Wine Gums product I could find;I have tried every Wine Gums product I could find. Maynard's are the very best for flavor and texture.
3;an OK yogurt bar;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;disappointing;I don't know if I got a bad box but mine did not resemble the picture & were toasted very dark (burnt in my opinion). I was also looking for something with more flavor.
5;The best way to buy this product;If you like this iced tea, this is the best way to buy it.  The grocery stores in our area only sell it in the small tube of 4 or five units at some ridiculous price.
1;Not Happy;I ordered two bags and they were the same. There was not much of a variety.
3;Great Tasting Tea;The good news is this tea tastes Great. There is no overpowering bleach taste like a Lipton box I just bought.
5;Perfect....;This is EXACTLY what I was looking for to add to my food storage. They taste good, no additives and NON GMO which is most important to me.
1;Not so everlasting...;I bought this dog toy in the smaller size, with great anticipation of finally having something that my 1/2 Yorkie-1/2 Shih Tzu wouldn't chew up and destroy in one afternoon.  From that standpoint, I would say the toy was a success, because it actually took him about 24 hours to eat the ends out of the toy, nab the treat disk and be done with it.
3;low acid coffee;if you like coffee but don't want the acid.  this is a great coffee, the wife loved it and the dark roat.
4;Good stuff, but overpriced;I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.
4;SHASH PREMIUM PEACH BLACK TEA;THIS IS A GREAT QUALITY FLAVOURED PEACH BLACK TEA THAT I LOVE. I USED TO STRICTLY BUY BENTLEYS<br />BUT THEY HAVE STOPPED SELLING THE PEACH FLAVOR AND THIS IS A GREAT SUBSTITUTE.
2;Not for Dark Blend Coffee Drinkers;I am a fan of other Timothy K Cups, but not this one. I tried it based on the reviews, but unfortunately it is not that strong.
4;Doesn't last long for agressive chewers;I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food.
5;Newman's best, indeed.;Good chocolate. You can actually taste the orange citrus flavor.
1;Bland, mostly flavorless white soup with potato;This soup has no discernible dairy or clam flavor at all.  There is a bland white base, chemically thickened, with no hint of milk, butter, or cream.
5;LAND O LAKES HOT CHOCOLATE;On cold winter evening my husband and I enjoy drinking hot chocolate while sitting in front of the fire watching a good movie. This is the best hot cocoa mix we have tried yet .
4;Not bad;These noodles are a low carb, high protein alternative to regular pasta.  They are decent for stir frys and simple dishes.
5;Awesome Tea!;This tea is really great and I'm super happy I decided to try it. Its got a really mellow flavor that to me isn't all that sweet, the only drawback is that it's not as soothing as regular chamomile.
5;Fabulous Cola;I've been enjoying this cola for about 2 years. I will never again buy the run-of-the-mill Supermarket deadly duo.
1;BUYER BEWARE;This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix.
5;Great for Dogs;This food is great. My 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since I changed her food.
5;AWESOME FOR PRICE!;Wow, I was super impressed with this item.  I wanted a cool party favor for my sons' birthday party, and boy did I get it.
5;Dandy dandy blend;We love the flavor of this coffee flavored drink. The vendor shipped very quickly and the price is very good for this large bag of coffee drink.
5;LOVE this!!! No sugar, NO Calories!!!;I love this product!!! I love Cafe Mochas from Starbucks, but hate the high calorie content (even with non-fat milk). So, I'll buy a cafe latte or cappuccino instead and add this to it and it tastes the same! I'll also use the sugar-free raspberry to make a Raspberry Mocha.
4;Very filling and high in fiber;I keep some of this made all the time. I make two boxes at a time.
5;5+++++ Stars for Bear Naked Granola!!;Hands down, this is my favorite granola.  It tastes great, it's natural and healthy (not alot of sugars).
5;Tasty Tasty;It is crunchy.  I like the chocolate coating to be less sweet.
5;yummy yummy;My dogs LOVE Greenies!!  I have offered them a choice of Greenies or Nutri Dent several times..
5;great taste and  great size for kids;This juice is good taste and good size for kids..
3;Strong taste, nothing special;This isn't bad water
5;Great tasting chocolate!;I like the fact that this bar contains natural ingredients, such as real vanilla.  I can't tell any difference in the taste of this from sugar-sweetened chocolate.
5;perfect chili sauce for hot dogs;if you like chili on your hot dogs this premium sauce fits the bill. very yummy and a bit spicy, this sauce is exactly what the doctor prescribed.
1;BEEFEATER PACK OF 12;THIS IS NOT A PACK OF 12 BUT OF 3. I AM VERY UNHAPPY.
5;Pretty good;These are pretty good and these are not low calorie..
3;Product expiration & bulk ordering;The product itself is pretty straight forward.  It's got pureed organic baby food in a little pouch.
4;A bit acidic, but great flavor!;This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.
1;Greenies are not digestible -your puppy will vomit and have diarrhea and will get very sick;I made the mistake to give a Greeny to my puppy without reading reviews about this product. It was a bad idea.
4;A straight-ahead pleasure;This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.
5;Kirkland Signature USDA Organic No-Salt Seasoning 14.5 oz;This is the best No Salt season I've got so far, it is way better than buying Mrs.Dash,We add this seasoning to all the food we cook, Taste is Good and has No Salt at all it is healthy and you can add all to you need.
5;GREAT DEAL AND TASTE GREAT;SLIM JIMS ARE GREAT AND THIS IS THE CHEAPEST PRICE I HAVE FOUND.FAST SHIPPING GOT IN 2 DAYS.
5;Great Tasting Water;I am very picky about my water. I moved to Florida at the age of 15 and I quickly realized that I could not drink the tap water.
5;Healthy Alternative for Working Moms;I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.
5;Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee;I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package.
5;Great for all breeds!;I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food.
1;Not worth the price!;I ordered this product expecting it to to look like the picture shown.  When I received the antler it was about 4inches long and extremely thin (in width).
5;Libby Pumpkin bread;The package came in a timely manner. This is great pumkin bread.
5;Favorite!!!;For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.
5;pinupgirl;I LOVE tea.  But I don't like the caffine so I drink decaf which sometimes lacks body and flavor.
2;Not What I Expected...;I bought this Kona brand of beans based on reviews and think the responses are somewhat exaggerated. I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee?  After shipping I paid $27.
5;Very fun container for party favors!;I bought these for my daughter's birthday party.  We had a movie/hollywood theme and we served popcorn in these containers during the party.
1;So so overpriced;Anyone who would purchase this product from Amazon for the stated price  of $40.43 for 100 stix of 55.
5;Yummy;Very good, much better than the coconut flavored M&Ms (that don't even contain coconut). These have a candy shell, some chocolate, and actual coconut flakes inside.
5;Great taste for a sugar-free cookie;Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores. She likes these and the shortbread cookies.
5;If I were a dog, this is what I would feed myself;You know how you are supposed to transition gradually to a new food? When I first started to switch my dog to this, she picked out all the new pieces and left the old stuff behind. (old stuff=Blue Buffalo).
5;Rocks!!!;Great way to keep Twizzlers around the house and also keep them fresh.  All Twizzlers are individually wrapped for freshness, and the plastic container is reusable, too.
5;Yummy;It was a little spicier than I expected, but I like that.  You can save yourself work by only adding 1 1/2 packets of water to the noodles and vegetable packet mixture and microwaving for the  directed time.
3;Tasty;I've never liked flavored coffee, so I am pleasantly surprised to report that this one is pretty good.  The chocolate flavor is perhaps too intense, so it's not balanced with the coffee flavor like an ordinary mocha, but maybe that's a good thing.
3;kind of artificial tasting;This K cup has a little bit of an artificial flavor and does not taste particularrly like mocha nuts or fudge.  It taste more like a genericly flavored coffee.
5;Delicious granola;I bought this at a health food store and loved the taste. I am delighted at the lower price and auto availability of this product.
1;Stale Granola Bars;The Granola bars, with about a month left before being out of date, were stale, petrified and inedible.  I returned the product to the original seller.
5;Our cats love these!;These do seem to cut down on hair balls and our 2 cats devour them.  We use a little less than recommended since they seem to cause runny stools.
5;Cookie Tosser;A friend of mine brought this to work and we decided to try it.  She tried mixing it with water, but the powder didn't seem to mix properly and it turned into this thick green muddy consistency.
5;best popcorn no mess;This food product is the best because when i get off school i just turn on my popcorn machine, wait for it to get hot. then i just cut the whole bag and the popcorn start popping in like 2 to 5 minute.
5;Best I've had.;I got this mustard along time ago at a grocery store and I loved it so much. It's good on everything.
4;Similac Advance;I purchased Similac Advance for my sister. It was a great gift for a new mother because you tend to go through a can very quickly.
5;GREAT VALUE!!!!;Not much to add to the other 5 star reviews, had to provide my 5 star rating, this product deserves the highest rating possible.  I only buy Ceylon Cinnamon, it is  healthier than Cassia, and it actually tastes better.
5;Great vegetarian option!;I haven't had ramen since I became a vegetarian 5 years ago. Then I found this while browsing on Amazon.
3;Okay flavor, but awfully sweet;I love peanut sauce.  I hadn't tried a dried-sauce mix before.
5;Best snack ever;I give these to my little one all the time and I think they are great. I also purchased the veggie ones and he loves them.
5;Best Chews Ever!;I can't say enough about this product!  My dog was sick for 6 months last year, and hospitalized twice.  Her food was changed 4 times, before they figured out she was allergic to just about every kind of meat!  What is a dog to do???  There wasn't anything out there that she could chew on (that she liked).
5;Yehuda Gluten Free Matzo;Was really pleased to be able to purchase this in larger quantities in an 'off' season.  I had originally found it in a grocery store but it was only in for a short time.
5;Superb, top of the line dry dog food;I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box.
5;My New Favorite!;Got a personal Keurig brewer about two months ago.  Finding tea locally is nearly impossible.
5;Love these Healthy & BPA Free Eden Organic Refried Pinto Beans;These are my favorite since I can prepare them as I like.  I normally saute some onions.
5;living up to expectations;I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control.  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it.
5;Vermont Maple Syrup;From placing the order to receiving the product the service couldn't have been better. And you paid the freight.
5;Too expensive on Amazon!;This is my favorite K-cup and one my husband and I can agree on (I prefer darker roast, he likes a lighter roast coffee).  It holds up well to the cream and Splenda I add.
5;Love;My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater.
1;Hjv;Will not order this product again..
5;Tully's espresso is a good strong coffee;If you want a strong coffee with no bitter after taste this is the coffee you want to try. It is finely ground enough I use less to make a pot of coffee.
5;These are great;My daughter (4 yr) and I love to just chew on these.  I leave them out over night and then they are nice and crunchy the next day.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
5;Good spicy tea;This tea is a must for people who like a flavored tea.  It has enough spice to taste but not overpowering.
4;Nice, Bold Decaf!;I really enjoy Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf it has a rich bold flavor.  I like to make an extra large cup in the morning and mix two together, Jazzed Up Decaf and Newman's Own Extra Bold.
5;Cytomax Pomegranate Berry;I love the Pomegranate Berry Cytomax.  At the Death Ride, they served this drink, and I tried it for the first time.
4;Great training treat! Puppy loves them.;We are using these treats for training and they work great.  Small treats so you can do a lot of training without a lot of calories.
5;Great quality food;I have a bouvier des flandres who I fed this food to until he was about a year old.  My dog's breeder recommended Iams and Eukanuba, but Wellness is such a far superior product.
4;delicious but a  bit  pricy;These are great on top of fruit and yogurt and my oatmeal with fruit.  i wish they still came dirdectly from Amazon and were less expensive.
4;Love it!;I bought the Baby Brezza after alot of research and I'm happy to say I love it!  It steams and purees and is SO easy.  One thing to note is that after the food is steamed there is alot of water in the processor which is fine if your baby likes really runny purees.
4;Yummy!;We bought a large popcorn machine for our children and our guests and it's a hit!!  Everyone loves it.  It's just like being at a movie and it's super easy to use.
5;Exactly what I was looking for;"Another review said this tastes like the ""garbage"" cappuccinos from the gas station. Well in my case, that is exactly what I wanted! These K-Cups are delicious."
5;Good stuff!;Great cheesey popcorn.  Wish it wasn't two servings and that they had had the calories - 300/bag but worth every calorie.
5;DE BOLES PASTA SHELLS;i Love pasta, but it is fattening.  This pasta is delicious and has no starch to turn to sugar and then fat.
5;Wonderful Product;This is a GREAT product. I hate to review it because I don't want to have the demand go up and the price then follow!! But, I wouldn't want to deprive anyone of this wonderful product.
5;Yummy!;Okay, I will admit that I have a sweet tooth. I love these bags as they are just enough to leave me satisfied without feeling guilty about eating a big bag or box.
5;Best tasting Milk, always handy on the go;Its the best milk that I have tasted so good in long time. I like the 8Oz size, easy to carry and best thing it last a long time no matter you keep it refrigerated or not.
5;She likes it!;My cat really likes these though I can't tell why.  She likes the chicken, fish, and tuna flavors a lot, and the beef pretty well.
1;Tastes Like Horse Food;It was dry, tastelss, and had the distict flavor of hay.  Did not have near enough fruit.
4;Great Item, Lousy Price;These certainly are fresh and delicious.  However, I buy a 6lb bag of the Black Forest gummy bears and gummy worms mixed for $6 at Costco.
5;Love Love Love Hawaiian Shaved Ice.;As soon as my order arrived (which was fast - 3 days and free shipping) I immediately opened it and fixed myself a Pina Colada and its only 11 am.  This is absolutely the best syrup for shaved ice.
4;Beyond Belief!;This sauce is terrific..
1;Not a Gluten Free Product;I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten.
1;Holy Cow - are these expensive!;I started a diet a few months ago.  I found that portion control is one of the most important factors when I have an occasional treat.
5;I finally found this!;I love making spaghetti sauce by adding Spatini to plain tomato sauce. I was so upset when the grocery stores in my area stopped carrying it.
4;Tortilla Soup;I usually make my tortilla soup from scratch, but it's great to have this around. It's rather tasty, and surprisingly so for an instant soup.
1;An unfortunate pairing;Is it possible that culinary great Wolfgang Puck would lend his name to such a mediocre food product? If you buy this sauce, you'll find your answer and that answer is yes. I highly doubt that Wolfgang Puck actually tasted this sauce before he signed the contract to attach his name and likeness to this insipid product but with the other Wolfgang Puck food products I've tried lately I'm starting to see a trend.
2;Not worth the money;The potatos and hot dogs are really good..
4;Very sweet.. warning-- a little bit goes a *long* way!;I don't like sugar all that much, so I always try different sweeteners, from Sweet N' Low to Equal, Splenda and lately I have been using Truvia.<br /><br />Usually I put it in unsweetened tea (hot or cold) and coffee.
3;Not Quite Feeling the Love;These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.
5;Regina;They were beautiful.  The only problem was the florist had to contact me as Amazon does not indicate date flowers need to be delivered.
3;Tastes pretty bad by itself.;This doesn't taste like sweet tea to me. Which, I suppose, if that is what you're going for, steer clear.
1;Not the real deal. It's been altered.;"Very disingenuous label and marketing.  It's reconstituted from concentrate and has ""natural flavoring"" (not labeled as organic btw) which can be anything including MSG."
4;Not cat food but my dog likes it anyway;My dogs favorite dry food is the cats leftover science diet, if she can get it, so I'm not too sure about her street creds when it comes to choosing dog food, however she likes the Purina Beneful original dog food  for the time being. Any dry food she doesn't turn her nose up at is a plus.
4;licorice tea;Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
5;Healthy Product  Great Taste;The title of this reveiw says it all. I look forward to eating it every morning.
3;Not as good as it can be;Was very excited to get this chocolate cereal but after several bowls, I don't think I'll buy it again.<br /><br />Good:<br />- Cool package both in terms of looks and in feel, you can feel the cubes :)<br />- Crunchy<br />- Feels like it's filled with some chocolate<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Sticks to your hands (when you eat from the box) and to your teeth<br />- Has a slight sour after taste, though I expected a sweet one<br />- Does not turn the milk in the cereal bowl into chocolate flavor (as I reasonably expected)<br />- Loses flavor when not stored ideally.
5;Great service and grains;First batch was lost in the mail so a second batch was promptly sent.  The amount of grains was small but you do not need a lot!  After several months, the grains are about two tablespoons in size.
5;Bitter and delicious, great quality, and helps animals too.;I love the Endangered Species brand of chocolates. I used to buy them at Target, but my store quit carrying them.
5;The VERY BEST Lemon Ginger tea out there!;This tea is the ONLY lemon ginger tea I will buy!  All other brands have some off-flavor, or are mixed with others.  This one has exactly the right blend and is always wonderful.
5;My 9 year big dog and 6 mo tiny dog love it!;My nine year old Dingo used to get smelly after a month on IAMS.  It's been three months since his last bath (I just brush him) and no smell with Canidae!  My 6mo old Chihuahua was on IAMS for puppies but kept sneeking the Canidae from my Dingo.
3;Dogs like this, but ...;My two Golden Retrievers like these a lot, but they are expensive and they disappear very quickly.  I prefer chews that last longer.
5;OMG I FOUND AT LAST MY LOVE!!;OMG! I cannot believe amazon.com has this product online being sold! This chocolate is amazing, i agree with the last review the american version is not so good, but this chocolate?? YUMMY!!!<br /><br />I am from the caribbean and whevever you go to the supermarkets in the islands they have only this version!<br /><br />It's sooooo.
5;Decaf with Flavor;I've tried other decafs and half decafs but this one has a bolder flavor that I didn't find in the others I tried. I would recommend this coffee to decaf drinkers looking for a bolder taste.
5;Delish;Found this in London on a trip last year.  Hard to find in the states except here.
2;Cat loves food, but subscription service is unreliable.;All five of the Fancy Feast subscriptions I signed up for have been unreliable.  Im October, I signed up for delivery every two months and received shipments only in October and December (it's now March 18, but I canceled all of my subscriptions yesterday).
4;This is totally in my cold season arsenal.;It may just all be in my head (no pun intended), but I really think this tea works. I drink a couple of mugs a day when I have a cold, and I definitely feel better and less congested.
5;Coffee gourmet;This is a 'must have' for real coffee afficionados  ..
5;Best drink ever;i tried this at the beginning of the summer after a long bike ride. it was so refreshing and amazing.
2;It smelled nice....;Firstly, I prefer my beans roasted slightly darker, this is very much a blonde roast.  But I could possibly re-roast these beans, however:<br /><br />My favorite coffee of all time was something sold by Starbucks called Komodo Dragon, and other coffees like it by Starbucks.
5;Superb Coffee -Get Some !;"So glad I tried this brand.  I usually blend four kinds of beans for ""MY"" coffee mixture."
5;I have say they are bomb!;They make my goats go yummy yum when they lick it up. Yeah I sort those people who give candy to goats.
5;Tastes great and so convenient;I bought these using the subscription method so the price is better than any other supplier I have found.  They taste very similar to the ones I was getting at Wegman's so I am not sure why some would find them tart or foul tasting.
1;Cups Can Be Defective;This is a good French roast coffee, although it could be a little bolder. I've never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup.
1;They are from China, not from Italy;The description is misleading. Mushrooms are from China, not from Italy.
5;Excellent chips, full of flavor and just the right thickness and doneness;I purchased the Salt and Vinegar chips and have been very pleased. There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.
3;Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage;"As consumers of Gold Kili regular/plain [[ASIN:B001EPPLWM  Ginger Drink]], this beverage ranks far below and tastes bitter.<br /><br />The other concern is its ""Natural Lemon Flavour"" ."
5;Full of flavor;To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors).
5;great pantry keeper;I love keeping these on hand because you will find plenty of ways to use them and they are easier to use than buying the canned or boxes because  you don't have to use it right away.  I use them for soups, sauces & many other recipes to give it flavor plus you save money because there is two bouillon cubes in each envelope and it lasts a lot longer than the ones you buy in a jar.
5;Good for Multies;I bought these months ago for my L. multifasciatus.
4;A good choice;I was taking a break from my regular coffee, and took one of my wife's Stash Green Chai Tea packs. Very pleasantly surprised.
5;Perfectly descriptive name;"This is our favorite of all the K-cups.  Its a really bold and ""wake-up"" brew."
5;Lego Candy;Candy was a big hit at our daughter-in-law to be's bridal shower.  Everyone got a kick out of the fact that the pieces fit together, especially our grandson.
5;Great for desk snacking.;Good ingredients, excellent taste. I brought the bag to work for some at desk snacking.
1;CHEAP IMITATION - DO NOT BUY;I've had a lot of San Marzano tomatoes in my day, both fresh and canned, and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet. I opened the first can from this order, and the tomatoes weren't very good at all - nothing like I was used to.
5;Awesome Candy from Paris;I recently bought a bag of Michoko Carmel Candies when I was in Paris as a gift for the girls I work with. I wish that I had opened the bag and tried one before bringing it back to the US.
5;kitty approves.;kitty says she likes it. it also prevents her from becoming a fatty since it's starch and grain free.
5;I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!;All I can say is this has done wonders for me.It makes my skin radiant, my hair shines,great for digestion,great for energy, and my aches and pains  all went away when I drink Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar.
5;3g. Fiber Per Serving!;Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn!  They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag.  3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag.
5;Restaurant Quality Taste;We love Tandoori Chicken with Basmati Rice. This seasoning mix is so perfect and allows us to enjoy a Restaurant Quality meal at home.
5;Delicious;This hapi Nori Maki snack is delicious.  It is hard to find where I live so I am more than happy to order by the case from Amazon.
5;My son's favorites;I have a three-year-old celiac who knows more about GF cookies than most adults, and these are his favorite cookies.  I like them too.
2;I've had better...;Like many other reviewers have stated, many of the special points of this water are just marketing claims, and I agree. There's nothing really special about this product, it's basically flavorless Gatorade.
5;Favorite chocolate bar in the world;I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat in which to indulge, whether to forget your bad day or to reward yourself for a job well done.
3;Fair;Of all of the Pamela's prepared products that I've tried, these are among my least favorite.  The cookie texture crumbled in my hands, and the balance between the sweetness or the cookie and the tartness of the coffee was lacking.
5;Jeremiah's Coffee;This coffee is excellent.  I was searching for an organic coffee and stumbled across Amazon's website.
4;Good Product if  the product is Fresh;Before you buy ask the expiration date.<br />These are usually very good wafers but the expire date<br />must not be past or within a few weeks.
4;Suprisingly light and tasty;I love chips of all root vegetables-beets, potatoes, parsnips, carrots etc.  I love potato popchips had never tried the sweet potato version.
3;Flavor, ease of preparation just okay;Usually, I find these boxed dinners a fair trade-off considering the time they save
5;great product;The brown rice pasta and the Pamela's pancake mix are as good as the real thing, we only use this anymore, as my wife also likes it. The price may seem high but when you see how many uses you get from the package it is very cheap for a gluten free product.
3;Okay;I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit.
5;Ahh......The Sweet Memories of Childhood;When I saw these, I just knew I had to get them. I loved them when I was a child growing up in New England and they were a special treat that my mother let me have several times a year.
3;Moist on the inside;This sea salt has a great taste however the salt comes moist because its that natural from the sea ..
5;Excellent!;Love this stuff!  Everyone likes it.  Am planning to try the other flavors now as well.
5;I'm sold!!;I've become a huge fan of the GalloLea pizza kits. The procedure for making the dough is very simple.
5;good light coffee flavor;If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.
5;The best in the U.S. market today.;"About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it (""they've been eating Wellness for years!""), and end up blaming it on the company."
5;Great for hiding medication.;My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication.
5;So much easier on my babies tummy.;When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.
4;Good but Folgers version is better.;Good but Folgers version is significantly better tastewise and so far amazon doesn't carry it. Good price though, and I like the free shipping--which I'm not certain will last.
4;Really sweet.  Small packages.;The people at my office must love me for all the food products that I share with them.  Overall people liked this.
2;stick with the Keebler elves;Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.
5;Spiral Sliced Ham from Omaha Steaks;Although I have enjoyed many products from Omaha Steaks in the past, I didn't even know that the company sold a spiral sliced ham.<br /><br />It was terrific.
5;Love This Stuff!;Absolutely delicious! The 4-ounce size is great, although there is kind of a lot of packaging. I like to enjoy some with a nice cold beer.
5;Great for work;I got these so I can always have some packets at work - I think I'm set for a while.  I didn't quite realize just how many of these there were.
5;Awesome Flavor;I have to rate this product high even though I am not a coffee drinker. My daugthers just loved this convenient product that can be used at school or in the college dorm.
4;Van Ness CP66 Enclosed Sifting Cat Pan/Litter Box, Large;We have used this pan for a while.  We found that the door discourages the cats from entry so we removed the door with no problems.
5;"We feel ""normal"" again after finding Sunbutter";When our oldest son had a reaction to a cashew and was rushed to the ED, we knew he had an allergy.  Little did we know, that day would change our lives.
2;Not A Good Flavor, But Good Against Bad Breath;"""Eclipse Breeze Exotic Berry"" gum is surprisingly unpleasant tasting as the cardamom and berry flavors do not go together! I bought this flavor after trying <a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;TOTALLY DECEPTIVE PICTURE;The picture shows a package of 10 Greenies but when you order it, you only receive one!  What a total absolute ripoff.  After going around with Amazon Customer Service though, I'm happy to say they are going to refund my money.
5;Love this coffee;Like really bold coffee. While not as bold as some traditionally brewed coffee, this one is one of the best I've found for the Keurig.
4;Good Deal.....Just Average Powder;This is a good tasting powder for the money you pay.  It's one of the best deals on Amazon for onion powder to be sure.
2;Ziggies;My puppies really like this in their little Kongs. The only issue I have it that they do not last very long.
5;use it all the time now!;I use this sugar in my coffee and love the flavor! I think the sweetness is more delicate and I taste hints of caramel. I use the same amount as I used to with regular brown sugar.
1;not like the enjoy life cookies;I thought these would be more like the cookies.  My son is very picky and won't eat these but LOVES the cookies.
5;Great. Just a little pricey;This is hands down the best cup of coffee. It helps me not drink a whole pot of coffee, because 1) It is too expensive to drink more than one via a morning.
5;Twice the price but convenient for travel and back-up;The price on Amazon for these ready to use cans (16 8-ounce cans) fluctuates from 25 to 29 cents per ounce, which is a little more than double what you would pay for the most economical container of powder Enfamil formula (approximately 11 to 13 cents per reconstituted ounce).  Sometimes the convenience is worth the extra money.
5;SIMPLY THE BEST!;My only wish was that these were cheaper. But hey, better to spend my money in real food than in doctor bills!<br />Nick's sticks are the best grass fed and free range jerky on the market!<br /><br />These are soft, seasoning is just perfect not only for adults but also for kids.
1;Like no peach I have ever tasted;Peaches are beyond crisp. Had to poach them for ten minutes in order to use them in peach melba.
5;Yummy!;This is the best.  We have them once a year whether we need them or not!  Also make good Christmas Gifts for out of state friends and family.
5;Our favorite Granola;Our family really likes this granola. It is a natural, healthy, organic cereal and it's also delicious.
5;Wish I could find these locally;I love these crusts.  Only caveats are to use them in a timely manner (some of mine got too old and smelled bad
5;I love the item;I love the item but one egg cup was cracked when I opened the box.  It was packed well so I'm sure it's a fluke.
5;Excellent;These are excellent. They have slightly bitter flavor, as does all good chocolate.
3;depends on the box;One of the boxes was very good and fresh. The other box I recieved was very dry and you could tell it had been sitting in the shelf a little too long.
5;Great coffee!;My wife wanted to make coffee at home, but she loved Starbucks coffee.  So she asked me to find her some good coffee to compete with her favorite.
5;Helps me get better results when baking but doesn't taste much different;I ordered this to try primarily becuase I come from a part of the East Coast where our Tap water or Well water is naturally more Alkaline  than it is here in SOuthern CA.  For almost 20 years I've tried to make a decent crispy pizza crust or the right combination of tender on the inside, crsuty on the outside homemade breads.
1;Arsenic in multi-vitamins;For the last 2 years I have been giving my 4 year old these berries.  He loves them and we trusted Nordic Naturals.
4;Taste great!!!;My hubby loves these cookies.  He would eat the entire shipment in one week if I would let him.
4;dog treats - beef liver;The dog loves these treats. But why is this particular package size not sealed? All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid.
2;Maybe It Was Just Me But....;I have long and and over processed damaged hair.<br />I have tried so many products and more often than not I am majorly disappointed.
4;Good Stuff;If you like to control the flavor and sweetness of your water, then this works out very well.  I like my water slightly sweetened and flavored and mixes are always too strong.
1;Everlasting or about 5 minutes... whichever comes first.;I was going out of town for X-Mas and thought these would keep my boys a bit entertained while I was gone.  I have two smallish (15 pound) Boston Terriers and they each completely destroyed one of these in about five minutes.
5;goodness and sweetness without necessary extras;I have been using this product for about a year now.  It tastes good and the cinnamon and raisins add just the right sweetness, without added sugar.
4;Yummy and Easy;Easy to make in the microwave.  Makes a great side dish.
5;Indian Tandoori;If you love to use your grill and you want to make a hit with friends and family this is for you! Simple to use and the flavor is amazing!! Even the hardest to please in my family loved it. And left overs are great.
5;Good quinoa at a good price;I found this quinoa to be very tasty.  I have been rinsing before each cooking, but I wouldn't say I've rinsed excessively, and the quinoa has always had a very wonderful flavor.
3;great product...rotten shipping;The product I've used before so I know it's great, but in shipping the jar leaked all over..
5;Best Candy in Existence;I have ordered this product twice and both times it shipped very quickly. The candy itself was in perfect condition both times and just as good as I had remembered from when they used to sell it in the store by my house.
3;Cloves Overpowering;There is a very strong clove flavor in this tea. I like my tea black and did not enjoy it very much.
3;Good idea;A great idea and I would recommend it.  However, it would be nice if the cigars were a little bigger and more cigar shaped.
5;My Dogs LOVEEEEEE these;Can't beat Amazon prices!  They treats are GREAT for training!  Small and great to keep in a little tote while you are training your puppies.  Small enough that I can give them a bunch.
4;A Good Mix Of Electrolytes After Heavy Workouts.;I recently discovered Coconut water to be available in a nearby grocery store so I've been trying several of the different flavors. The latest is Zico  Mango.
2;scary, not sure what happened, manufacturing problem maybe;I have used Pacific Natural soup products before, and bought a case of these to try the organic creamy tomato. I had these in my cabinet for one month after receiving them in good condition from Amazon, and one of them exploded in the case!  They had been stored at room temperature, and it's not that hot in SF.
5;Perfect!;I bought the La Florentine Torrone for a friend's birthday present.  We spent two weeks in Italy last year and spent a lot of time sampling and looking for a torrone that duplicated her childhood memories.
5;Great for just about every food.;Visited a relative in Canada who was using this product and imported it from South Carolina.  Loved it from the start.
5;Superlative dish;This is great tabouli.  I have been having great difficulty finding tabouli in recent months, in any retail grocers.
1;Ordered because of great reviews---wish I hadn't!;I saw this product on Amazon - saw that it kept getting great reviews and took a chance. I placed an order and now I have 7 boxes still here! I should have listened to the reviews that were less than stellar! For some reason I felt very uncomfortable after eating the 1st box.
3;Dog loves it but......;After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good.
1;Oh it was AWFUL!;Having read the other reviews, I wonder if mine had just gone bad.  It has almost a fermented alcohol-like smell.
3;Pretty hard and not very flavorful;With a title like that, you might wonder why I still gave them 3 stars. Well, they keep my mouth occupied.
5;Awesome mints even for those without allergies;"I tried these because a friend had allergies (I don't) but I am hooked. The honey goes down ""smoother"" than the sugar in regular mint patties."
5;9 month old daughter LOVES these;What a great way to get some good nutrients in a baby food. And, in these packages, I cannot tell you how CONVENIENT they are.
1;Protein Chips;The Kay's Naturals protein crispy Parmesan  pack of 12 protein chips tasted aweful. I would not recommend them to anyone.
5;very good;I bought this tea to drink it cold or warm. Because is summer I drink it cold.
5;If you love coconut:;These coconut bars ares so delicious, soft and moist. Fantastic product and very good for you.
5;Best bar;My wife loves these better than the peanut butter fudge.  I still prefer the peanut butter fudge bars.
5;Fantastic salsa;I first saw this salsa in a grocery store in Southern California. The regular price was a bit high, but it was on sale so I picked up a jar.
5;Pine Salt;Perfectly ground Himalayan salt or pink salt.  This was recommended by a holistic practioner and is stronger tasting than regular salt.
5;The best around!;Labrada Lean Body is the best tasting meal replacement shake available!  I've been buying MRP shakes for over 10 years and I haven't found another brand that comes close to this.  It tastes great and mixes completely.
5;C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E );"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it."
4;Good;I love chocolate covered pretzels, and these are pretty good. The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book.
5;Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!!;First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.
1;Where is it?;I place an order for this kit on december first and was told it should arrive on the 6th. I've not received my product, not heard from the manufacturers, not able to find a number or anything for me to contact them and want this product for my brother for christmas.
5;VERY GOOD AND GOOD FOR YOU!!!;This product is one of the healthiest things I eat all day and the taste is great.  Organic whole foods and no sodium.
5;Good Things Come in Stinky Packages;I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs.
5;Dogs get bored with treats, they like variety, too;This bucket of assorted dog treats is a real hit at our house.  Full of muscle chews, pizzle sticks, sausage treats, jerky, both beef and chicken, etc.
5;Wonderful!;I was standing in a hallway at my daughter's high school when one of the other parents handed me this sucker.  I loved it!  Within a couple of days, I went to the grocery store to buy a bag and they were out.
2;didn't really like this flavor;I love this product, and every other flavor that I've tried (grape, mixed berry, and strawberry). However, I didn't like this flavor at all.
4;olive oil;"This olive oil has a very nice taste with a bit of apicy kick.<br />The only concern I have is that the item description says ""Bio-Organic""<br />but I could not find the term ""organic"" on the label, just ""Bio""."
5;low carb goodness!;Loved this and the lemmon pepper fettuccine. I tried the lemmon pepper as well and it is GOOD.
5;Best way to buy cranberry sauce;Ocean Spray is the best cranberry sauce I've tried.  It has just the right amount of sweetness yet still keeps the cranberry flavor.
5;yummy;Daughter loves these since she was 7 months. Great way to keep her busy while I need time to get to other things.
5;Super Yummy;Yummy!!! one of the only food items that I can order from amazon that arrives consistently fresh and yummy.  My boyfriend can't get enough of these either.
5;Favorite of all 10 cats!;I've tried many brands of canned cat food. This one was the winner! All 10 cats gobble this up, and I have seen an amazing improvement in their vitality.
5;Hot Cinnamon Spice Girl;These Hot Cinnamon Spice Tea bags were a Christmas present.  The person receiving this gift really liked this brand of tea because it has a well put together blend of spices as not to be overwhelming but satisfying.
5;Pure Coconut Oil with nice flavor and good price;I'd been reading about the health benefits of eating pure, unadulterated coconut oil, and found that the little jars in the supermarket were just too expensive. So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity.
5;great product;I have been using xylitol by NOW for many years. It has proved to be the best tasting sugar substitute i have found.
5;Awesome marinara;"Hands down this is the best marinara I have ever had in a ""can"" and may be better than most ""homemade"". absolutely awesome."
3;Great Taste!;These are fantastic tasting crackers but I didn't reorder because my hands felt like I had been eating potato chips!  Too much fat for me, that's probably why they taste so good.  If you're skinny and have the self control to eat just two or three and put the box away, then go for it.
1;Not Good;Roland's baby corn pales in comparison to other brands of canned baby corn. Oddly, the corns look greyish, not yellow.
5;Really tasty non-caffeine alternative;Love this tea as an iced-tea alternative. The flavor needs little sugar and it's a great alternative to soda pop.
5;Lovely plant Speedy Service;I sent this as a gift, and it arrived with lightening speed, in perfect condition.  The only negative was that my recipient mentioned there was no tray under the plant,and usually plants come on a decent little tray.
3;Just your average shampoo;Seems like a very average shampoo..
5;Haci Bekir Turkish Delight;This is the Turkish Delight you've been looking for, if you appreciate the real deal.  Flavorful, rather than just sickly sweet like so many imitators, Haci Bekir makes theirs Old World wonderful and in serving sizes that can be savored and enjoyed.
5;"This is the greatest ""milk"" product on the planet.";I've tried coconut water a few times and never liked it, but had to try this when I saw it at the store last night. I am so glad I did.
4;Tastes good and keeps you full;I'm a big cereal person. I can spend about ten minutes in the cereal aisle, comparing nutritional information, trying to choose between different flavors and brands (yeah, I'm super indecisive :/).
5;Great for Adults;I have long been a big fan of Clif bars (Chocolate Brownie flavor), so I was eager to try this product. I was pleased to see that just one of these ropes equals a full serving of fruit, and that the added sweetening comes from fruit juice.
5;oh my goodness.....;This stuff is bliss in a jar. It's true that you can make your own, but sometimes it's nice to just have someone else do all the work.
5;Dermatologist Recommended Pet Owner Approved!;We adopted a 5 year old black lab who was a walking snowstorm of dandruff when we got him.  He had no hair on his belly and a lot missing from the rest of him due to severe untreated allergies.
5;My shelties love this dog food;Now Grain Free Turkey and Duck Formula dog food is great.  My shelties love it and I love that it has no junk in the formula.
5;Wow;Guess we can't go back to the old clear honey..
5;Perfect Alternative For Children With Peanut Allergies!!;We have tried several different alternatives to peanut butter due to my sons peanut allergy. Sunbutter is by far the absolute best we've tried but it's extremely hard to find in stores and when you do find it it's over $7 a jar!<br />This 6 pack was a great deal!!! I was worried about buying so many at a time considering the same thing purchased in the stores only had about 3-4 months till the expiration date.
5;Kids love it and it's healthy;My son's main breakfast. I pack it when traveling but do wish there was a bulk packaging option.
5;Perfect option for popcorn;I learned fro Dr OZ show. it made popcorn so delicious without any butter.
5;An old favorite becomes a new favorite;I always loved Shake and Bake for pork when I was a kid, but for some reason, I hadn't had it in many, many years. I'm not sure how today's formulation of it compares to it in the 1960's, but it's every bit as good as I remembered it.
5;Great Size for Small Dogs!!! AND MINE LOVES IT!;The problem with treats for me was finding one I didn't have to keep breaking into little pieces when I was training.  Not only that, it seems my little Morkie really enjoys these.
4;Exactly what it aims to be;For anyone who simply wants a basic, American-style cup of coffee, this is perfectly fine. No, it's not as full-flavored or (arguably) as good as most of the higher priced Tassimo offerings, but it isn't intended to be.
3;Eh.... it was okay;This product was okay.  The Moon-Pie was pretty bashed up and some of the taffy-like candy was VERY hard, maybe stale.
5;Good product, great deal!;Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can
1;Tastes like cardboard!;I read about these on [..
5;my weight loss solution;I believe that my keeping this oatmeal as my everyday breakfast helps me to lose/maintain my weight.  I make a batch of it (enough for about a week) and bring it to work.
5;My dog would do anything for this treat;By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.
5;Best tasting peppermint tea!;First introduced to this delicious tea when served @ a gourmet breakfast place in Blowing Rock, NC.<br /><br />Took a bag home w/ me so I could look for it online.
5;Mirabelle Jam;The Mirabelle was very very good.  I would highly recommended that if you haven't had Mirabelle to try it.
2;not a time or effort saver;I wish I had thought about this purchase a little longer. It takes a large space to work on the sifting, the clumps have to be dumped from a large container into a trash bag, then the litter from one large container to another, after the sifter is reinserted.
5;My Pomeranians LOVE these!;Fabulous product line!  No odors!  No stains!  I have two male 8 pound Pomeranians and they love these as a treat at night when my husband and I are watching a movie.  It is great to not worry about them staining the bedding or furniture.
3;Like Fast Food for Your Dog;Yes, my dog loves this food. But it is highly processed and full of flavor and color enhancers (and the color is for the human, as dogs are color blind and don't care.
5;really like the taste;Despite what some people are saying, I really like the taste of these, but I also like licorice.  These all have a licorice/anise taste to them.
5;"Move over ""Jell-O""...";"There's a new gelatin in town!!<br /><br />  I've made a concerted effort to watch what eat the past couple of years.  Because ""Jell-O"" contains dyes in their products, I decided to search for a healthier alternative."
5;My son loves this;My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.
5;Wonderful;I love these, the fruit flavor is good and I like the tangy, tart flavor.  I am pleased I can buy them in a bulk pack, since my local stores are often out.
5;LOVE THIS POWDER MILK!;MY 4 YR OLD TILL THIS DAY LOVES THIS MILK..
5;Cats LOVE this flavor!;Even my most finicky cat LOVED this flavor.  The bowls are spotless after their meal!  I haven't been able to find this flavor by itself in the store, only in variety packs, and my cats don't like all the other flavors in the variety packs.
4;Good, not great, coffee;"With the Amazon discounts, five pounds of good coffee for under $30 is good.  I expected more ""Macho""/ Starbuck's type flavor."
5;Best oil for hair;According the research online, the coconut oil work great on hair. It is the only oil reported to penetrate the hair shaft and leaves hair soft/moistened.
4;delicious!;This is my favorite salsa!  Very difficult to find in stores, so I was delighted when I saw that it could be ordered @ Amazon.  My last order, however, was mislabeled, I think.
5;My All-Time Favorite Tully's K-Cup Flavor!;I usually drink Tully's French or Kona, but decided to get this since I had seen some really good reviews on it. It seemed like a lot of people were buying it, so I wanted to find out why.
2;Tasteless, Weak, Brown Water;If that's what you're going for, then this is the coffee for you!<br /><br />To preface, I'm no coffee snob, but I've had my fair share of good and bad beans.  I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.
4;It's not Jiffy, but it's not bad;When you're in your fifties and find out that you can never eat gluten again, it's depressing.  By this age, we are used to foods tasting a certain way.
2;good but weak;I am use to a stronger blend I guess. This was ok, but just too weak for our taste.
3;Too sweet for my taste;I tried this as an alternative to Kashi's Honey Almond Flax (Chewy Granola) bars, which I love almost as much as the Roasted Almond Crunch (Crunchy Granola) bars. It's possible I'd like the Tail Mix bars when I'm in the middle of a long, strenuous hike, but it could be months before I test that hypothesis.
4;John West Herring in Tomato Sauce;John West Herring in tomato sauce is one of the best products of this type I've ever bought. I have been enjoying this for over 50 years and of all the brands I've had, theirs ranks among the best.
4;a nice treat, especially with berries;I love Hunt's sugar free vanilla snack packs.  I frequently take a cup of raspberries or sliced strawberries and mix them with a pudding cup for a tasty, low calorie snack that keeps me satisfied between meals.
5;Delicious;Wonderfully fresh and full of chocolate chip chunks.  Hard to stop after just 3 cookies!  My kids love them also.
5;Yummy Peanut Butter Cup Coffee;This is a good, satisfying cup of coffee.  The flavor is rich and memorable.
2;This one is NOT all that good;We were happy to see a flavor of instant tea from Lipton that didn't have aspartame in it.<br />Mind you, this tea has THREE sweeteners in it - really? Did it really need so much?<br />I vote a resounding NO.
4;May be able to find cheaper but a great deal non the less;I needed some more oatmeal for breakfast and this hit the spot. I myself need more than just one packet and will typically use a plain and another flavor to use up the plain oatmeal.
5;Best stevia hands down!;I've been using stevia for 3 years now since I found out I was allergic to sugar. Out of everything I've tried this is by far the best.
5;Good Syrup;I liked it. Good experience.
1;With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility;It should come as no surprise to anybody reading this review that bacon has a well deserved, and nearly cult like following.  Whether it be a highfalutin' cut of pancetta or some good ol' American pork belly bacon, that entire family of cured meats garners a lot of love.
5;Good Product;I mash a small piece of fresh banana and mix with a container of this and my daughter eats the whole thing like candy.  I like to take these on the go as opposed to the glass jars because I don't have to worry about it breaking inside my bag.
5;My Happy Chama Dog;My Dog Chama loves the Food and I love how good it is for her. I also love that it is shipped to me.
5;Wonderful tea!;I used to only make coffee with k-cups in my Keurig. I would make tea, but just used the hot water and my own tea bags.
5;SO GOOD;I DO NOT EVEN CARE IF THIS IS OVERPRICED, THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. THERE'S NOT A TON OF MEAT IN EACH PACKAGE, BUT IT HITS THE SPOT.
5;Good water;I enjoy the taste of the water, my family and neighbors that have tried it also like the water.<br />It it's worth it and it has an interesting story.
1;Only for donkeys;Being Greek and loving cooking I bought this ot make some dolmades. Now let me tell you, 90% of a dolma success is about getting good leaves.
4;Great non-meat alternative;Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet.
1;Huge disappointment;I love black bean soups of all types, but this is the first perfectly awful recipe I've ever encountered.  First of all many additional ingredients are required (whole purple onion, quart of chicken broth, orange juice) and it is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to produce.
3;Not as good as other Natural Balance formulas...;I decided to purchase the Fish and Sweet Potato formula from Natural Balance when they inexplicably jacked up the price of their Bison and Sweet Potato formula.  Unfortunately, the fish formula doesn't work nearly as well as the bison (and venison) formulas do.
5;Delicious!;Got this for our Valentines dinner and oooo lala it was great. Heard about it on tv.
5;My Desired Treat!!!!!!!!!!!;This product is by far my most important in my cupboard to me. Everyone should try them just once.
2;Plastic Is Not Durable Enough for a Dog Toy;My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor.
5;Spicy, yummy goodness!;The first time I tried these we had gotten them in a gift basket at work. It was love at first taste! Not your typical ginger spice cookies.
4;it is a good product;I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it.
5;NOW, THIS IS REAL ITALIAN COFFEE;I drink this coffee daily and I love it!<br />I am Italian and I know  Lavazza very well, that's the only coffee my family and I drink. If you are expecting a weak taste like the normal american coffee, do not buy this kind.
5;Best money you can spend on jelly beans;Jelly bellies are awesome! These are jelly bellies, therefore, these are awesome!<br /><br />There were a few in the bag that had questionable flavor and some of the ones that were stuck together have quite a bit more coating (personally my favorite ones!) but over all this is really a great buy because Jelly bellies are usually pretty expensive.<br /><br />The bags that I got had many different flavors in them although there were probably only about 40 flavors all together.
5;Love At First Bite;Great Taste & Very Sweet (not necessarily a bad thing, depends on what you like)<br /><br />Honestly when you've been deprived of good snacks for so long, having a little extra sweet isn't anything to complain about. I eat 4 or 5 at a time and have some water handy.
5;adult son loves this tea;My son uses about 2 boxes a month of this sweetened iced tea k-cups.  Since he's hard to buy for, we purchased a couple boxes for Christmas.
1;Sugar Free!;Do not buy this product if you dislike the sugar free after taste! It isnt in the item name but be sure to know even though it is an apple cider it still is definitely sugar-free. I would like this product if it was just left alone! The small print is deceiving.
5;GREAT PIMENTO STUFFED QUEEN OLIVES;I LOVE OLIVES, but I never thought I'd find these tasty morsels at Amazon. They are really good and have the perfect tecture I crave.
1;Splenda / Sucralose in all flavours...;I'm not a fan of diet soda, and even the Non-Diet flavours have splenda in them.  This does let them have a more concentrated product and therefore a smaller bottle, but I don't like the taste.
4;I received my M&Ms just fine.;I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging.
5;Great Deal !!!!;This was an awesome deal ! I love a strong cup of coffee and this is the best I have had in the k-cup varieties. It's bold and smooth.
4;YUM!;came in a plastic bag, in a box. wasnt the freshest, but still yummy.
5;best ever snack or breakfast bars;These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.
4;Shipping Charges;The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again.
3;Tastes nothing like tea;I love Lipton's instant fruit teas.  I love brewed tea.
5;Fantastic Healthy Snack;I originally got this popcorn at a local grocery, but found myself buying it almost weekly, so decided to purchase in bulk here on Amazon to save a bit on cost and time. I found I could save about $0.
1;Horrible;This soup is salty, bland, and tired. I needed to sprinkle in a bunch of pepper.
5;Excellent vegetarian protein source;I wanted to add chia gel (seeds soaked in water and kept in the 'fridge) as a protein source to my vegetarian diet and these being organic, and coming from a trusted seller (Sprout House) seemed like a good choice.  They are just what I needed and the gel is handy as well as useful in creating tasty treats, using as a substitute for eggs, and a thckener.
4;Big fan of these bars.;These bars are very tasty.  I mean, they're not a candy bar, and they don't taste quite so good as a candy bar.
4;Tasty;I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted.
5;cats love it too !;this is an all around product. i carry some with me all the time.
5;Great noodle!;My two kids (one 4-yr and one 7-yr) love this noodle a lot!  They like school amerian food mostly, and dont enjoy chinese or asian food that much.  It is very intereting to see they all love this noodle.
5;Best Organic Pasta Sauce EVER!!!;After trying all of the organic pasta sauces out there and being truly disappointed, we were ecstatic to find this sauce.  We were wanting to wean off of Prego which uses GMO's in their products and had really tried them all.
2;Go for Pinhead Gunpowder instead...;"Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste."
5;My husband LOVES this coffee!;It's hard to find coffee that is strong enough for the Keurig Coffee Maker.  This is it.
3;Wolfgang Puck Sorrento K-cups;We have tried just about every k-cup of regular coffee out there.  We don't do the flavor kind.
5;Addictive!;I love wasabi..
5;My Pugs love these long-lasting chews!;Himalayan dog chews are a special treat for my Pugs..
5;Best Thai Dipping Sauce;I bought this while I was in the US visiting my parents.  Thai Sweet Chili in general is my favourite type of dipping sauce.
5;I love this product!!!!!;I bought a Beaba Babycook about three months ago. My husband and I love this product.
2;WALMART;THIS ITEM IS OVERPRICED.  THE TREATS ARE GOOD.
2;"What is ""Zinger?""";"I bought this tea and I did not enjoy it. I like this brand a lot but for whatever reason the teas labeled as ""Zinger"" have a strange tart taste to them."
5;Great Stuff;The difference this stuff makes in a work out and recovery is amazing. I found myself able to push out more reps in the gym and ride a whole lot harder on my road bike.
5;Love these crackers!;I bought these all the time when I lived in England 20 years ago during a semester abroad. I just visited England again, saw them in the grocery store, and love them all over again! My kids love them, too.
1;short weight;The three packages were supposed to contain 10 ounces each. They were 8 ounces.
5;Sugar Free Gumballs;The sugar free gumballs are just the right size for children and have a very good taste.  My grandchildren love them.
5;Always a good cuppa;We always enjoy this tea, it is our daily morning cup.  Amazon seems to have the best price and is always prompt with shipping.
5;Great sauce!;This is the most delicious soy sauce I have ever tasted.  I will surely order it again.
5;Great flavor, and even better price.;I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.
5;Pop Chips;I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.
4;Nice and convenient;Having my grandson over every weekend I thought I would give this product a try. Very glad I did he really likes it and it so easy to serve and dispose of the packaging.
4;One of the better soup bases;This Pho soup base is good if you don't have time to make soup from scratch. Very few restaurants actually make Pho soup from scratch.
5;Much better than expected, great for the kids;I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.
1;seriously? over a dollar a packet?;I cannot believe how expensive these are!  Even at the local grocery store they are only $.69 per packet, full price.
5;ZICO NATURAL IN THE BOTTLE ROCKS!;I love the new ZICO in the bottle!! The natural is my fave!!  It is a bit nuttier than the Tetra ZICO.  The bottle makes it so much easier to take to the gym, on my bike or throw in my backpack.
1;Not as strong as previous orders;I've bought this flavor a number of times before.  This latest order, the coffee simply isn't as strong as previous orders.
5;Great snack!;We found this product while on vacation in South Carolina. Once we got home, we found it wasn't available in our town so, I went to Amazon.
5;Delicious, if you like coconut;I love coconut flavored anything almost as much as I love coffee, and this is the perfect blend of the two. The coconut taste isn't overpowering, but it's strong enough to make me feel like I'm enjoying my morning (or afternoon) cup of coffee at some beautiful island in the Mediterranean.
5;An AWESOME Substitute for Breads, Waffles, Etc.;This was my first purchase of GF stuff.  Well, I couldn't believe how great and versatile it was.
5;Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods;Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.
5;Yummy Deliciousness!;These butter glazed goodies are really delicious. I couldn't find them in the stores anymore so I bought them on-line.
5;Bewley's Irish Tea;Just returned from Ireland and had this tea often there.  I was so happy to find that Amazon had a resource for me to get it, too.
5;Deliciously chewy;"When asked to try these, my daughter said ""delicious"".  Asked for more information she added that they are soft."
5;Excellent Soda Alternative!;I don't drink a lot of sugary drinks and soft drinks.  I try to watch sugar intake and dislike overly sweet drinks.
4;Unique corn snack;These are not the hard crunch corny snacks, but the kernels freeze dried in their original form.  The corn flavor is good, and a nice change from heavier snacks.
4;creamer;I was extremely happy at the price I paid for this item. I send my husband w coffee every day and its as if he went for gourmet coffee daily.
5;Great Little Snack...But only on sale!;"In my opinion these are better tasting than your average ""100 calorie pack"" and ten less cals. They remind me of rice crispy treats, with a little more body and a little less crunch."
4;for my sister;I purchased this for my sister while sitting in the NICU with her and her newborn twins. She had been pumping trying to get her milk to come in so it could be provided for her 32 weekers:) She was very nervous as she had poor supply with her first child and now to try it with two, it seemed a challenge to say the least.
5;I love it!;I love this coconut oil. I use it for my hair, skin and cooking! The hair is so soft after this.
5;Premium Bourbon-Madagascar Vanilla Beans - 1/4 lb. - Approx. 27 beans;I ordered this product hoping that I would get a great product, and was not disappointed.  The vanilla beans arrived before the first day of the estimated date of delivery!!  When I finally got them un-boxed and could get my first look & feel, I was not disappointed.
5;Excellent dark chocolate;Scharffen Berger is known for being high quality chocolate, preferred by some chefs for baking.  Although some of the very dark chocolates can not only be bitter but one-dimensional and chalky, this one has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness and also a fruitiness that I enjoy.
4;Wow!;This item was featured on Dr Oz show as he was spotlighting healthier snack alternatives.  The chocolate chunk are the only ones available on amazon right now so that's the one I tried.
5;It's About Time!;It's about time that we get an easier way to enjoy our Graham Crackers!<br /><br />These smaller packages with squares rather than rectangular crackers make both serving and storing easier.  One pack was enough for one day's snack for my kids and I didn't worry about the remaining ones becoming stale.
4;Good stuff!!!!!;My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.
2;Only OK;Not as spicy as I expected, and certainly not hot enough to mask the inimicable vienna sausage 'flavor'.  I got these asa survival food source, and that's what they are going to be, as they sit in my storage shed waiting for armegeddon.
4;Still searching....;I am searching for a different mix this time.  The brownies taste great, but the frosting is weird tasting.
4;Very Blueberry;Love KIND bars but can't say this is my favorite.  If you like a strong blueberry taste, then you will LOVE these.
5;Healthy and Delicious!;I am on a GFCF diet and Blood Type O diet so I am very limited on what I can eat. I first found Bone Suckin' Sauce at the Fresh Market after months of searching for a natural barbeque sauce that tasted good.
4;My dogs favor the sirloin over the chicken;My dogs liked the previous flavors (chicken, etc.) so I was enthused to try this new flavor.
5;Good coffee;Real coffee flavor and a lovely taste.  Love getting up to a fresh 1st cup, 2nd cup or however many I want.
5;Baby Says Yum!;My daughter pretty much exclusively eats Earth's Best baby food. The stage two fruit and whole grain combo is well-liked by her.
4;Tastes good, but a bit messy and wasteful;The pasta and sauce are separately packaged with the dry pasta in the bottom plastic container and the sauce in an inner container above the pasta.  The top is perforated, with a plastic film covering the holes.
5;Best High-quality K cup;This is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find.  Very rich flavors and a medium + roast.
5;Fantastic!;As a mother of a 3 year old with severe food allergies (milk, eggs, nuts) I have tried several brands of 'allergy free' baking mixes out there. Cherrybrook kitchen is by FAR the best tasting.
5;Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookies;So good! I had to order 2 cases at the great sale price. I am nibbling on one package right now and they are delicious.
5;Great for Training my Puppy;I have a German shorthaired pointer puppy who is very difficult to walk.  These treats have been very helpful.
5;Spanish Garden Smoked Spanish Paprika 2.65-ounce cans;Great product. Quality and flavor are oustanding.
3;Taste great made in China;I really enjoyed the look, texture, and taste of the bars.  I am very disappointed that they are produced in China and this will prevent me from purchasing them in the future (less health standards).
5;Great Chocolate;I love chocolate, but sugar is my enemy.  I have tried many kinds of dark chocolate with a high percentage of cacao and as of today, Ghirardelli's 86% cacao is the best.
5;Just Can't Beat it! Amazon is awesome!;This is awesome !<br /> You can purchase your favorites on line get them FASSSST ! Delivered right to the house. All you have to do is bring them in eat them .
5;Who needs Starbucks;Have been drinking this coffee for years. Have tried all the coffees recommend in Consumer Reports and this is my favorite.
5;So simple to use!;I purchased this baby food cooker for my son and daughter in law to use with my grandson. It is so simple to use and so convenient.
1;Hard with Strong Molasses Flavor;I am gluten free and was craving soft black licorice that tasted like Twizzlers black licorice but was gluten free.  Candy Tree Organic Licorice does NOT taste like Twizzlers black licorice, and it is much harder to chew.
5;Best Dog Food Ever;After bouts with Pancreatitis in both of my schnauzers (neither are overweight, but have major sensitivities to fat content), this is the only food I can feed them without worrying if it's right for them.  It has no corn, which is fantastic--unlike other cheaper brands.
3;first time taster;This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this.
5;pamela's Ultimate Baking Mix;LOVE, LOVE, Love Pamela's Ultimate Baking Mix.  Our family uses it almost exclusively now.
5;Just buy it.;I'm a coffee snob, and this is presently my favorite coffee the world over.  They also have one called Theo Blend, for which they teamed with a chocolatier down the street.
5;Love my Grow A Head!;"My grow a head actually grew faster than stated. Within a few days, my head had sprouted ""hair"" and within a week it was an inch tall."
5;FATBOY is the Bomb!;This stuff is the BOMB! I put it on a steak bomb as a condiment it was awesome! Also try it on a roast beef sandwich.  You will never eat either one again without some fatboy on them.
5;great coffee pods;I am so happy with Melita coffee pods.  Now I don't have to worry about using my Senseo coffee maker as there were no pods on the market.
2;Water with an aftertaste;I drink water all day long. Usually plain out of the tap water.
2;"Wow... and not a good ""wow"".";Buyer beware.  This basket is tiny and not worth the cost.
2;rather artificial taste;I was hoping for a more natural vanilla taste - you know like with just ground vanilla beans added to the coffee. I find the other flavors added make it taste a bit artificial.
5;You may become addicted!!!;"I first received Zatarian's Creole Mustard for my birthday three decades ago from a friend in New Orleans after tasting in earlier in New Orleans and loving it. It is unique, not really having a strong ""mustard taste"", almost like a horseradish/mustard if you can possibly imagine what that would be like."
5;Quality Cat Food;This is a pricey cat food, but short of making my own, I don't think I've found a better food.  Brandon Farms is the only other organic food that compares.
2;Too Much Ginger;I wish I could give these cookies a great review.  However, I can't.
4;Wonderful natural treat Made in USA;We got these as a x-mas gift and this is the BEST treat! I am very careful about what I give my Shih Tzu who is a puppymill rescue and has health issues. This treat is a 100% natural made with 100% chicken and also VERY IMPORTANT is that it is NOT MADE IN CHINA.
5;apparently, delicious;my cat is going to be morbidly obese. she loves this food so much it's almost dangerous to her health and my wallet.
3;New recipe? Not impressed.;"The, I'm assuming ""old"" recipe, raspberry confection chews used to be one of my favorite candies. I loved them."
5;Gluten Free?;Mi-Del Gluten-Free Ginger Snaps are the only gluten free cookies I've found that I would put on par with really good regular cookies. Besides a taste that I enjoy, they have a nice slightly chewy texture.
5;the best green tea;I first tasted this tea when I visited Okinawa.  The Japanese have all sorts of vending machines, everywhere!  This is such a tasty, earthy flavored tea.
5;Favorite Treat of my Dogs;My Bichon has several allergies, many of them to food.  It's very difficult to find treats that don't have animal product ingredients.
3;Yummy Lollipops, But Not Much of an Assortment...;I bought these lollipops earlier in the year for my very picky kids, and was really pleased with them. My older son especially liked the cherry flavor.
3;Bulk Fruit Purchase;The product is good. Nice and moist.
5;the ONLY one for me! -Isabella;This is the ONLY brand that I will eat.  Of course, they have tried to feed me a ZILLION different brands and flavors, but this is what I started with & this is the brand I am sticking to.
5;Essentia Water is essential!;I have been drinking Essentia Water for the past year after a friend introduced me to Ph correct alkaline water. I used to take gallons from her ionic filter, but after a while I needed to find a new source.
5;Fenugreek Seed Tea;I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding.
5;Zooom;This stuff is perfect for a cloudy Monday morning when you really don't want to get up. It helps! Tasty stuff, very strong.
5;Oh man do these hit the spot!;Doing the HCG diet.  These are hard to find and there is so little to pick from.
5;great noodles at a decent price;I stopped buying noodles from the local asian market thanks to amazon!<br /><br />i use these noodles for stir fry as well as soups such as pho. they cook easily and taste great! the price is very reasonable.
5;The Best Ice Cream!;These vanilla beans have become a staple in my kitchen.  The flavor is so wonderful that I no longer buy vanilla ice cream -- I make it.
3;No Olive flavor;While these chips taste good, there was no olive flavor in them whatsoever. You can even see the real olives in each piece, but the added olive did not add anything to the flavor.
3;Coffee is kind of weak, but not bad.;The coffee tastes fine, but it was a little on the weak side.  I only wish it was available in something other than Morning Blend.
5;Twinings Earl Grey Tea (Keurig cups);I had used the product before and wanted to purchase more.  The company I usually ordered from no longer carried the product.
3;l'Olivier olive oil from France;Very hard to find in stores in USA. Used to be sold in Occitane stores all over, that is finished.
2;K-Cup dissapointment;Was misinformed..
1;Too many shells;I got the 5 lbs bag.  Received it right away but this has too many shells.
3;Not bad but not great either.;Taste is very a subjective thing.  What one person loves, another may hate.
5;Great Snack;I can eat a pound of these things in one sitting.  These are top notch crackers.
5;great nuts!;I was concerned because a reviewer said there were bad nuts in her shipment, and I had bought a smaller bag of another brand that had some good and some bad nuts.  These are uniformly good (I opened one of the five pouches, but we have eaten about half of it without finding any problem).
5;Yummie;Amazing as a smoothie or just over ice cream or sherbet, cake, whatever.  Great natural peach flavor.
5;My Toddler Loves Them;My toddler has been eating these for several months and loves them. I love them because they don't crumble or make a mess, nor do they get goopy (yes, that is a technical term).
5;Best gift ever!;I bought these for my mother-in-law and she called me once a week for four straight weeks telling me how much she loved these flowers and how the buds kept blooming and blooming.  She has a cleaning lady who comes in every so often and even the cleaning lady can't stop raving.
4;Good, but not the best;These wine gums were pretty good. Compared to Maynards wine gums they are more tart and less chewy.
5;Best cheese curls period;I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack.
1;Tastes like evil;This is the worst tasting protein I have ever eaten. It is the Indiana Jones and the crystal skull of the protein world.
5;VERY FLEXIBLE;IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNATURE ON DELIVERY AND IT MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE PACKAGE.  BUT AFTER PLACING MY ORDER WITH THE COMPANY THIS TIME, I CALLED AND I ASKED THE WOMAN IF SHE COULD HAVE THE PKG DELIVERED WITH NO SIGNATURE.
3;OK;I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.
5;I LOVE this Jasmine tea.;My first experience with Novus brand tea was after my mother in law had gone to a coffee festival, and stocked up on tons of vendor give-aways.  Now, I buy this tea in whatever store I can buy it and whenever I can get it.
5;love it!;This product is great for skin and hair..
1;Metallic;I don't know how they process this water but I have found that it has a flat metallic taste to it. It was definitely not refreshing since I wanted to wash my mouth out from having that parched taste to it.
2;Knowing what to expect;When you purchase canned tomatoes, you do not expect to find a plump, juicy intact tomato like you would purchase in the produce aisle. So, expecting these tamales to equate to fresh or home-made tamales is just not realistic.
1;Fishy tasting soup;This soup has a strange fishy taste and is way too heavy on the vinegar.  I bought a case of this soup and am wondering what to do with the remaining 11 cans.
5;Cytomax-Cytosport Sports Energy Drink;This energy drink is my favorite for pre & post workout. I have been drinking it for years.
4;Good Tea...;..
1;Not recommended;I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.
5;an excellent cuppa;"really nice tea, and smells wonderful. I enjoy it with a teaspoon of ""sugar in the raw."
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;Healthy, Delicious Alternative to Ramen;I made the Zesty Ginger noodles with Chicken for dinner last night. I followed the recipe and directions exactly (though I added some fresh spinach, too), and it was delicious!! My 10 year old daughter and I loved it.
4;moist roasted chestnut in shell;Pleasant surprise fast shipping arrived within 32 days with free shipping.  Double boxed well packaged 24 pack roasted chestnuts.
3;Poor wrapper;I love blow pops. They taste great and last a long time.
2;It was nice while it lasted;Our company gave these as gives at a corprate party in February 2011.  There were 20 handed out to Exec.
5;BUY IT NOW;It comes out to roughly $0.42/ cup.
5;Extremely Yummy;I havent actually purchased these here yet, but I grew up with the Milk Brand in Europe, and I am SOO pleased to see them here for sale. All I can say is if your a chocolate lover, you WILL LOVE MILKA, its in no way close to any of the chocolate I've had here of just regular store brand typs.
5;Awesome;Found this on a consumer report website and it had the best reviews.  The ingredients are great and it's one of the best foods out there, but my dog just loves the food he was raised on, his royal canin puppy formula.
5;Some Goodness;"Normally words like ""coffee in a can"" would make me want to punch a kitten in the mouth but this had a truly nice effect. It made me feel calmer, less shaky, more like my normal, coffee-needing self."
4;decadent;This is soooo delicious!  my husband even asked for this again - that means it made it into like the top 5% of things he likes enough to remember :)  - very good.  they do melt very easily and so often they will be stuck together.
4;of all the varieties, *THIS* is the one you want....;"Swanson makes many versions of chicken broth and normally I'd go straight for the organic version of just about anything if available but in this case the Natural Goodness version is the best of the bunch. The chicken flavor is light (think broth NOT stock) and well balanced and makes a great base for the simplest of things like basic chicken soup with very little ""doctoring up""."
5;Very good, recommended;Ordered this early in the year and find we use it for all sorts of dishes. Much more interesting than just brown or white rice, the combination produces a great flavor and great texture.
3;Pretty decent - a bit bland;I prepared this hot, and just followed the instructions, adding very little (a dash of coriander, some fresh black pepper, and a dash of ground red pepper). The resulting dish was fine, but a bit bland.
1;Absolute garbage....  get a clue folks...;Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.
4;Delicious salt-crunch satisfying low calorie, high-fiber snack.;FiberGourmet Half Calorie Crackers are a<br />Delicious salt-crunch satisfying, low calorie, high-fiber snack.<br />The high fiber is an especially appreciated aspect.
4;garden pest deterrent;"Effective but has killed several birds and squirrels. I wonder if a ""pulsed"" charge would be non-lethal."
2;Never received product, undeliverable;I must first say that I have ordered thus product before and it was delicious. I decided to order another shipment even though i normally do not buy food product online.
5;Super Eggnog Yoghurt;This extract really works well. I used two tablespoons to make a half gallon of excellent eggnog flavored yoghurt.
4;MIO Peach Tea Reminded Me of Olive Garden's Peach Bellini Iced Tea;I've been using the MIO products for approximately two years, ever since discovering them at a demonstration at my nearby Farm Fresh.  The tear-shaped bottles are convenient for carrying with me in my backpack
4;Best hazelnut;Gloria Jeans seems to make the best tasting hazelnut. I tried all the rest and for some reason this one tastes the most natural to me.
4;Wonderful Ap&eacute;
1;Dog wont eat them;Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those.
5;Light and Easy;I love these waffles for a number of reasons, but the top ones include the natural ingredients, the kick they give you during long rides when you think there is no gas left in the tank, and how compact they are.  I have found that these and the stinger organic chews are very easy to consume while riding and are not followed up with a heavy/rot gut feeling.
5;Delicious, refreshing water!;I love the Metromint water in the two mint flavors. They are refreshing and give your mouth a clean, freshly brushed feeling.
5;GOOD;Wow, these pretels are amazingly good.  We are new to Gluten Free and pretty much expected them to taste like cardboard.
5;Best Ever;If you give jerky a second try - this product is like nothing you've ever tried.  Totally moist - totally killer flavors - no nitrates.
5;As Good As the Grade A Maple Syrup;The Grade B Syrup is as good if not better than the Grade A Syrup. It has a distinct tasty flavor and is an excellent choice on Belgian Waffles.
1;over priced;I must be out of my mind to pay this much for almond milk. I meant organic almond milk at whole food and trader's joe is about $2 a piece.
5;Salada green Tea;First, the package that arrived was extremely well packed.  This is tea for tea lovers.
5;Sugar Twin Packets are great;I can not locate sugar twin where I live so ordering it is the best way for me to get what I want and being able to use something that I have used and loved for well over 20 years, even when I was stationed Overseas my mother used to send it to me when I could not get it in them commissary.  Thanks Sugar Twin for staying available for those of us whom love the taste and the portability of the Packets.
5;Delicious!;This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.
5;Mix it with Chocolate Hemp Milk!;I can see why people havent been able to tolerate this powder..
5;YUM!;I *love* the mocha Click, I really do.  However, I just got my little hands on the Vanilla Latte and I think I love it more!!<br /><br />It is sweet and you can taste the vanilla, but it's not over-powering.
5;Ingenious!;This product is simply ingenious. It's important to me that my kitchen is uncluttered - and with limited space to start, I have to get creative.
5;Great product;
5;HAPPY;ONE OF THE BEST CRYSTAL LIGHT IN BOTH 12 QUART SIZE OR IN TO GO SIZE.  NICE BLEND OF TEA AND PEACH AND GREAT FOR DIABETICS.
5;Milk for my cereals any time.;I don't eat cereals every morning so buying a gallon or half a gallon of milk is a waste of money.  I throw away so many because the milk goes bad before I can finish it.
5;I don't usually REQUEST to leave a review but......;This product is so good that I had to review it.  Summertime means skin problems for my Schnauzers here in South Florida.
5;Good, but you have to like whole grain. Freeze well.;These fig bars are big step up over the typical supermarket brands, but you do have to like a strong whole-grain taste and the lack of additives makes them a bit dry. They freeze well so it works ok to buy the six pack.
5;cheaper than other agaves and great taste!;Bought this because ounce per ounce was cheaper than other agave brands.  Really does have a butterscotch taste and works great in cooking and baking.
5;Just like root beer;I thought this tasted great.  I let several people taste it and they thought it was real root beer.
5;Pretty dog gone good;I had been feeding my rescued greyhound a quality dog food which was top grade and expensive. However, the dog picked at her food and didn't eat much.
4;"Good but not as ""apricot-y"" as I would have liked.";I have had the cinnamon raisin (my favorite so far), coconut and apricot. The apricot are good but you don't get as much of the apricot flavor as I would have liked.
4;Good energy;I bought these for my husband and son as a less processed alternative to their Zone and Luna bars.  Turns out, they hate them but I really like them.
5;Awesome pup treats!;I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better treat than this.  They smell so good I find myself considering them as a snack!  The pups absolutely love them, and the ingredients are top notch.
5;the best chips ever;We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
5;Love them!;I bought a variety box of these at [..
5;Mix it with some White Couscous;I eat couscous as my main carb staple daily. Whole Wheat couscous is a little bland tasting, maybe like cardboard.
2;Lacks flavor;I love this brand of freeze dried fruit but found the mango variety to lack flavor..
4;Good Coffee!;I having been drinking this particular Maui brand of Maui Coffee for years..
5;Spicy and delicious;This is my favorite pre-prepared marinara sauce.  I love it's spicy zing.
5;Great product;I ordered the sweet chili because I was hoping that it would taste like the tuna I ate while in Australia.  It was very close and I enjoy it.
1;Absolutely Vile;I just tried this product for the first time this morning and was eager to do so. Boy, was I disappointed and disgusted! I tried with all my might to get through a fourth of the cup but I simply could not do it.
5;Keeps my eczema under control;I bought this product to try against recurrent eczema I've suffered with for 2 years.<br /><br />This is the first product (besides a prescription steroid cream that I want to avoid using) that has consistently done the job.
4;Great product but needs to be packed better;As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.
4;Silky hair color vibrant;For the last 12 years I have colored my hair religiously every 3 months. For the last 11 years I spent countless dollars on salon products and finally decided that their has to be other products that work as well if not better.
5;This is my 2nd favorite tea;I love the flavor of this tea. The smell out of the bag is very strong, but once made.
5;LOOOOVE these almonds!;I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot.
1;Too Small of a bag;I was puzzled when the item came in, it was sooooo small unlike the picture.  I dont think I will order this item again, too much money for too little product.
5;Great Banana Taste;Wanted to try this smoothie mix and am glad I did. It has great authentic banana taste and a fair amount of protein in a serving.
5;I am addicted to these!!;I have been getting these from Price Chopper in Paola, KS. However, I am afraid they will not be stocking them anymore.
5;"My ""babies"" love these!";Greenies get 5 stars from my cats!  They look forward to these every day.  One of our babies had gum problems and since he's been eating greenies, it's cleared up.
5;VERY GOOD;THIS PRODUCT WAS SMOKED PERFECTLY..
5;Sweet and Spicy;I have gotten SO many people hooked on these. They are a deliciously sweet/spicy soft & chewy treat.
5;Instant bliss!;Don't be intimidated by all these exotic Goya products, the company is actually<br />the oldest and most revered of all the commercial Spanish foods companies.<br /><br />This Recaito is a fantastic shortcut for some of the best homemade salsa you ever<br />tasted.
3;Good but pricey product;The ONLY way that I can get my dog's to take pills short of shoving them down their throats is to use this product. I tried hot dogs, cold cuts, hamburger, you name it.
1;Not what I thought;As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing.
5;Raisin Bran Cereal;Large boxes of cereal. Great price.
5;Peaceful LIfe;This is the absolutely best product. I have spent lots of money trying many different products to relax and calm me.
5;Pop Tarts;These are awesome.  They are so good that my husband will actually grab one and eat one without even toasting it.
5;Baking fun;I bought this a year ago for Christmas, my son and i had a blast making it. It has everything you need to get the job done and have fun doing it.
5;Biscoff spread is the best!;This stuff is the best.  Can't eat enough.
5;great fine!!!!!!!!!!!!;FIBER GOURMET LITE PASTA IS A LIFE SAVER, I USE THE PASTA ALL THE TIME, IT TASTE GREAT AND YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT IT IS HIGH FIBER. I WILL ORDER ALL THE TIME FROM NOW ON.
5;Orgain Chocolate Fudge;I really like the taste of this drink over any other drink I have had like this since it does not have the synthetic taste of muscle milk or other post workout drinks. The fact that its organic makes it a healthier choice and so far I have no complaints about it.
5;Fabulous;I love this seasoning!  I do not pop microwave popcorn.  Instead, I pop it myself on the stove top.
2;Stale Stale Stale!!;"If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, ""that's a great deal!""  These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh.  The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box."
3;Very Bold;Not bad. I was not expecting a that bold of a taste.
5;It's Knox What can you say;I use Knox Unflavored Gelatin all the time.  Delivery was prompt, and the product was undamaged and as represented.
4;Avid health nut here, and love this product!;Overview:  I used to work for Vitamin World and always wanted to try this product that was on the shelves, however, our employee discount didn't cover brands that weren't manufactured by us, so I never really gave it a shot.<br /><br />However, I recently just moved to college, and using RAW Meal has been a miracle.
5;Cute!;Perfect for a small gift topper or as a part of a gift bag or set! Just the perfect amount to make them enjoyable but not too much to feel like it's a waste if a flavor was..
5;Wolfgand Puck's Breakfast in Bed Coffee;Never got a delivery as fast as we did this time.  We were running low on our special coffee.
1;READ THE INGREDIENTS!;I think anyone who reads the ingredients on this stuff and continues to buy them is not paying attention. Try smoking, testing for voltage with your tongue, or jogging along a congested highway
1;Works for a Minute... Gives you pain for hours;I never drink energy drinks. I'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water.
5;Great product, great price.;I have almost finished my 1st 10lb bag, and am getting ready to buy at least one more. You just can't beat the value - what a great hedge against rising food prices! I'm not sure the description mentions it, but this is red quinoa.
5;Tea Anyone?;My wife and I both love this Tea! She is the more picky about her tea, between the 2 of us. If she likes it than it must really be good since she has tried a great many different kinds and can be considered a connoisseur.
5;Popchips 6 Flavor Variety;These chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories.  They are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors.
5;Perfect;These are cheap when you buy them in bulk here.  The container is big enough and seed quality is great.
5;Great Taste, No MSG;Excellent flavor. Easy to make.
1;EXTREMELY UNHAPPY;Can't find where to complain directly to the vendor yet
5;The best Tea I have ever drank;I actually buy directly from the Runa website as their prices are a little better. This tea is amazing, I used to drink coffee like a mad women now I drink 1-2 cups and then it's the Guayusa tea.
5;dog loves them;They're a nice change from rawhides for my dog..
5;Really good - little powdery but good;These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.
4;Healthy and easy to prepare.;Hi! I bought the 6-pack from Warehouse Deals. Rice needed sauce to bring up the flavor.
2;A little mealy?;These are a little mealy or grainy, but are OK.  Pretty high in carbs though.
5;Great Instant Flavor Coffee;This ia great instant morning coffee drink. We also take it on travels and works out great in hotels and on board ship if you want something different.
1;None of my cats will touch this stuff;"I have three cats, and even the chow-hound (the one who will eat anything, even, frequently, the inedible) will not touch this stuff.  The same is true for the only other flavor in the Newman's Own Organics line we've tried (<a href=""http://www."
5;Great Maple Syrup;Better than the medium or dark amber grades, also would be a great gift.  Go ahead and try it.
5;My babies love them!;You can call me the crazy cat lady because I treat my cats like they are my kids.  I feed them and give them nothing but the best.
1;Arrived with ants in it!!!;My elderly mom loves peanut brittle, so this was a little gift/treat for her.<br />Sorry, but the packing of this product was so poor that the<br />white bag with the cellophane window that the candy was in<br />arrived in a box with no protective packing - no styrofoam, no<br />newspaper, nothing.
2;too sweet for me;This isn't bad, but it's too sweet for me. I think it'd be good as a mixer of frozen drink though (or frozen drink mixer!).
4;Delicioso!!!;Great tasting sauce for any type of pasta..
2;Funny After-taste;This coffee smells incredible, but the taste doesn't deliver.  There is an odd after taste that is really disappointing.
4;Just the Right Amount of Sweetness;Pomegranate is a difficult flavor for me to accurately place, so I'm not sure whether these taste a lot like pomegranate or not.  However, the flavor is good and they are pleasantly sweet.
5;Mama mia;This is the best whole wheat pasta on the market. You won't even know its good 4 u.
2;Good taste, but very hard, even sharp;"I really wanted to get these as take away snacks for my kids that would not ""rot"" in my bag if I happen to forget it was in there. And for that it works great, we can have fresh fruit at any time and I even leave a few in the glove compartment for snacking myself."
5;Excellent tea, and fast shipping;This is terrific tea. I bought it to make iced tea, and it's got a smooth, lovely flavor to it.
5;Fabulous!;These are marvelous treats. Delicate, cinnamony flavored.
5;Blackberry Goodness! Gluten Free!;I first tried this sauce at the farmer's market and found myself coming back for more. I prefer the original WildeBerryaki variety and my boyfriend likes the Spicy variety.
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
1;horrible seller;did not recieve on time and shipped to the wrong address. item was recieved a month + after the date it should have been and not in time for my boyfriend's birthday.
1;Tastes like a Campfire!!!;"The product description says, ""assertive, dark, smoky fragrance and flavor"" and they ain't kiddin'!!!  It barely tastes like tea at all.."
1;These seeds never sprouted!;I read the other reviews about these seeds not sprouting, but I thought I could do it and tried everything.<br />I could not get these seeds to sprout so it was a waste of my money and time.
5;Stuffed Bread;This stuffed antipasto bread was better than expected.  The outside is crusty.
3;Not A Bad Alternative To Soda, But Not A Great One Either;"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda ""Orange Crush,"" although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike ""Orange Crush,"" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it."
3;It's Decent...;First off, let me describe my situation and usage of this product.  I'm usually stuck at work all day with nothing to eat except trail mix and nuts.
5;my two dogs are now genuises;I just opened a bag of these mini naturals in chicken flavor, and did some training with my two shelties.  Within a few samples of the treat, my dogs were doing whatever I asked, quickly, and for quite a long time.
5;milder smell than others;First off, I have to say this is the BEST value I have found on EVCO - I really didn't know how BIG this container would be until it arrived!  But the way we go through it, I might divide it into smaller containers and start keeping them in different places instead of always running to the kitchen.  The oil looks and smells fresh and creamy, but maybe I am just getting more used to coconut oil, or maybe this batch doesn't have as much of that cocoa smell?  Not that that is a bad thing, I would just say it seems more neutral, especially after cooking with it.
5;Great Taste!;I purchased these from Whole Foods for my friend as a gift.  She has Celiac's (sp) and always talks about how crappy gluten free treats are.
5;AWESOME PASTA;Not only is this pasta high fiber and low calorie but surprisingly it tastes good too!!! I've had all that whole wheat pasta which isn't as healthy and tastes bad..
5;BOXES NOT BAGS....;Just a Note to tell everyone that the  4 LB.Variety comes in BOXES .
4;Isn't a favorite;I picked these up the other day from Sprouts, very pricey but thought I'd see what my daughter thought of them.  She's 14 months and enjoys a variety of these types of snacks and banana is generally her favorite flavor.
5;Great value;"I have been drinking this for years mixed in when I make instant coffee to ameliorate the ""instant"" taste and drink it stand alone lots of times also.  There ARE richer, creamier, better tasting cocoas out there but I like this stuff and you can't beat the price and the convenience of just adding hot water instead of milk."
5;Filling and low fat.;I just love these things. I decided to look on Amazon after having tried them at my local Smoothie King.
5;great training tool;I use these to train my dog.  As others have pointed out, they smell awful.
5;Finally Natural chewing gum;Finally chewing gum without all the artificial chemical ingredients. I'm a health conscious person, I would never ever buy any other commercial brands.
5;Happy Cat = healthy teeth and tasty food;My cat had some serious dental work done a few months ago.  The vet sent us home with some high quality food but my cat wasn't too thrilled with it.
5;Irresistable;Haribo makes an astonishing variety of candies. Gummi Raspberrys are an excellent candy that demonstrates the inspired imagination that sets Haribo apart from run of the mill candy makers.
5;Some aftertaste, but still good;Yes, it does have artificial sweetener.  Yes, you can taste it.
5;"The ""dream food"" of small breed overweight dogs!!!";This is it, look no further if you want a healthy, holistic dog food which supports  your dog immune system and keeps her weight under control. My dog was 2-3 pounds overweight and i had a very hard time finding a dog food which is good in nutritions and its low in fat.
5;Raw Bar with taste;For those on a raw diet, this product is one of the best.  It is a simple snack (made with only two ingredients
5;FLATBREAD EXPERIENCE;If one is seeking the very best flatbread/cracker in the universe, this is it.  Low fat and high fiber is just a plus.
5;past;About five or six years ago I used to buy mi del cookies weekly hoping that the cookies wouldn't add inches to my waist line. From what I rememeber , it was really yummy but had to stop buying them because it's expensive.
5;My review;I order four of Natural Calm and I receive one only I have been calling regarding this order and I have no sollution to this situation. I hope they send me the rest of my order.
5;very pleased;I have two Labrador retrievers who, in the past, have suffered with ear and skin allergies.<br /><br />We want the best for our dogs, and Premium Edge is the answer.
4;Good cheese yum;I like cheese.  I like crunchy snacks.
5;Great snacks, sent to our son at college.;Snacks arrived quickly and undamaged. They were within expiration date and eaten shortly after they arrived.
5;Yorkie LOVES these;My little yourkie absolutely loves these treats. He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.
5;"Better than Peanut M&M""s";I picked these up recently and the are amazing.  I like sweet stuff in the afternoon and rather than grabbing a couple of handfuls of junk candy, these are amzingly healthy.
5;Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix;I have been using Pamelas for over 8 years. You just cant go wrong with it.
4;Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .;My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc.
5;was well worth it;i am not a fan of beefaroni but my family loves it and was very pleased<br />this was one of the first food products i bought from amazon and was very satisfied with price and delivery-although i watch prices and waited for a sale because except for convenience i find unless on sale i can beat most of the food prices here. again though was very satisfied.
5;Mmm! Good!;I have a yeast allergy along with allergies to mold and soy.  This product has nothing in it that would be harmful to me
5;Looks like a winner;I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products
5;Great Tea;I order this tea whenever I'm down to two boxes. It's a very good blend and not always easy to find where I live.
5;Kitty Loves This;My 14 year old cat is in chronic renal failure and this is one of the few foods she will still eat readily. I assume this means it is amazing.
4;Tatsteh Tea;This tea is really tasty..
4;Green Tomato Relish;Reminds me of the relish my mother used to make at the end of the summer every year. Flavor is good, the only thing that would have made it better was if there had been less juice (liquid) in the jar and more relish.
4;"Favorite ""comfort food""";Many years ago, used to practically live on good ole Kraft Mac & cheese, but this is SO much better!  Great cheese blend, not too salty.  The only downside to the new packaging is that it's smaller.
5;Great Way to Start the Day from Amazon.Com;A recent study by nutritionists found that individuals who eat breakfast including a piece of cake (!) have more energy and are healthier than those who have a minimal breakfast.  For those of us who need an energy-booster in the AM, this is a real treat--along with cut up fruit and ample milk in the cereal bowl.
1;TERRIBLE TASTE;I was excited about receiving decaf tea, but it tastes absolutely horrible!  I can't even drink a full cup of it, I tried making it several different ways, but it is not good at all.  Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it.
4;Would I buy it again?;I probably would not buy this if I had the chance to. It was an odd, odd, flavor.
4;Yes, I know;That this is just the regular old horseradish and not REAL Japanese horseradish. But then, I spent a couple of decades in the sushi bars in NYC choking down wonderful, wonderful Cali rolls with exactly this horseradish, so naturally, I don't give a &lt
5;Yummy!;I just tried popchips for the first time and they were great!  I immediately went online to find them and order more.  Only 100 calories in the .
5;Delicious Alternative to Sugar;If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.
4;I wanted to love these...;I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey.
5;Best decaf;Finally, a decaf for the Kuerig that is good. I order these by the 50 pack and we are much happier than the other brand we were getting from Amazon.
4;Good but Beware!;This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend.
3;SWEET;My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say.
5;Great Dog Food!;I agree with other reviews, feed them less of this dog food! Both my dogs gained weight within the first week and a half. While this food is way over priced online, it is good for the money in discount feed stores.
1;Way too salty!;Everyone else has already said it..
5;QUALITY PRODUCT;This is a hard to fimd item and well worth buying the case lot.  Excellent on chicken and shrimp.
5;Best muffin cups ever!!!!!;These are so nice, I've used 1.5 packages of them and they come off the muffins super easily.
2;K cups disfigured and unusable;Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.
5;Good hot or cold;I have tried others, but I keep coming back to big train.  My favorite recipe is to make it into a Chai milkshake.
2;Do not recommend...;I recently adopted a 6 month old kitten from the humane society, and bought this food ahead of time.  I liked that both adult cats and kittens could eat this food, and I wanted a high quality food for my new pet.
5;Heavenly;Theses caramels are fantastic. The rich buttery taste of the caramel is so good.
5;Childhood memories;I was thrilled when I found, Walkers Brazil Nut Toffee, online at a good price. This brought back good memories, as it was a favorite of my Dad.
5;Hazelnut -- our Favorite;Our favorite K-Cup is Gloria Jean's Hazelnut. We have tried other brands but this is our preferred.
5;Very good natural ingredient for protein smoothie+ good value;I'm not a health nut but trying to exercise more without resorting to synthetic protein more than the occasional nutrition bar.  At it's core, this tastes like rope with a slight nutty edge.
1;A bunch of packets in a brown paper bag.;I ordered this thinking it would come properly packaged. What I got was a bunch of coffee single serves in a brown paper bag.
5;Glad I found this product;I found this at my local Costco. I'd never heard of it before, but was intrigued.
5;Hot, Hotter and Mo Hot;Mad Dog Revenge extract was more than I anticipated.  The slightest amount was so intense, the Devil himself couldn't stand it.
4;They changed the ingredients;Here are the new ingredients from the label of Creamy Chocolate Fudge..
5;Good Stuff;This coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor. Nothing wimpy about it.
4;Not the same strength as powder form;"I'm a Type 2 diabetic and wanted to try the tablet form of Equal since it doesn't have the ""fillers"" as the packets, thus raising blood sugar levels. I did notice a few points difference in my readings before and after my first cup of coffee."
5;I Can't Believe I Almost Passed On This One!;This wasn't going to be one of the many flavored Matcha that I was going to order from Red Leaf Tea.  I mean, I love Matcha, sure, but I do not drink a lot of alcohol, and while I have enjoyed many of the various alcohol-infused flavored teas that I've tried, it just isn't a flavor that I usually go for.
4;Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good;I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right.
5;ZICO-FINALLY IT WON'T SPILL;Finally someone figured it out to put coconut water in a bottle. Love the fact that i can walk around with and it won't spill.
5;Wonderful earthy flavor and clearly high quality for less cost;I cook a lot with paprika and I've found a great variance in quality over the years. Cheaper ones are more bland and have no heat, almost as though they are cut with some other spice.
5;Delicious;This coconut oil is great.  I haven't tried many others, but this one is organic and everything at a great price so I went for it and I'm loving it.
3;I wouldn't especially recommend it for travels;I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a fairly poor alternative for travels, since some of the fruit dissolves into very messy powder.
5;Yummy;I am loving this tea. Its very tasty with just a teaspoon of agave nectar.
5;My favorite tea;Although roasting mate removes some of it's nutritional value and lessens the amount of antioxidants in it, it is still better for you than coffee.  This blend is delicious!  I mix it with whole milk and a little sugar.
5;Convenient single serve coffee bags (hard to find in stores!);We've used these coffee bags on and off for years when camping.  They deliver real brewed coffee flavor just by adding boiling water.
4;Nice that it is low sodium;Any thing low or no sodium is nice to see. But you can get it for about a fifth the price at a local dept store's grocery.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;Delicious hot sauce!;I first discovered Huy Fong's sriracha hot sauce at a local restaurant and I love the flavor and spice it adds to soups, noodles, meat or vegetarian dishes, sandwiches and nearly anything. Sriracha hot chili sauce is a good balance between hot and too-hot
5;More to Love Peanut Butter M&Ms;These lasted barely a month but it was all worth it.  One of my favorite naughty snacks and yet oh so good.
5;Simple and delicious as well as versatile;This rice is delicious and can be eaten in so many ways, either sweet or savory. I have it on auto delivery!! My fave way to eat it as a breakfast.
5;Love this drink mix;My dentist told me to stop sipping carbonated diet soda all day because the carbonation was hard on my teeth (who knew?), so I've switched to drink mixes. I use this, frequently mixed with the pomegranate variety in a large jug, and I'm good to go.
5;Vet recommends;
2;Bitter Grass Clippings;I don't much care for this Stash Premium Loose Green Tea.  I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.
5;awesome flavor;I agree with the other reviewer that these are highly addictive. The serving size is 25 crackers (150 calories).
5;Buy It;This is a fantastic product. The kids were amazed by candy that can be used as legos!  I saw some reviews that said the taste was bad and/or too hard but I haven't found any kids in that camp.
5;Very good tea;This is a very good, honest, straightforward tea. It doesn't pretend to be anything more by adopting fancy names or claims to miraculous powers.
3;So-So Food for Dogs;It is very hard to tempt my dog with dry food, and this product proved NOT to be the exception. An almost life-long eater of moist food, my 10 year old Doxie - mix will eat a few bites if it is included with her canned food.
5;When I taste Lavazza, I am back in Italy!!;"After returning from Italy a few years ago, where my husband and I fell in love with the Lavazza espresso served in the cafes, we Googled ""Lavazza Crema e Gusto"" and found it on Amazon.  We have been ordering it ever since."
5;Delicious;Always purchase this coffee at the supermarket..
4;Good, Dark, Bitter-Sweet Comfort - but note wrong weight listed on Amazon;Great almost bitter chocolate but product listed at 2.5 pounds instead of 2.
5;This WOWed my dogs;I was on a business trip with my husband and we took our poodles along.  I needed treats for the poodles and saw these - figured I had nothing to lose.
5;Used this for our party favors;My son loved this healthy snack.  It comes in fun flavors, and looks like licorice.
2;Grits;It was too course. Should have been grinded finer.
1;EWWW;I like green tea but this is overly sweet, artificial tasting too and it has little pieces of what I am guessing is aloe vera, YUK. This is not really a healthy drink either, it has too much sugar which makes the drink too sweet, and from the label it appears to be watered down tea? I don't like it and it is definitely not worth paying the price.
5;great size, great teeth cleaning properties;These are great teeth cleaning chews that i can feel good about giving to my little guy and not pack on the pounds. Low calorie, healthy and they like the taste.
5;Excellent food, excellent value;We adopted a 2.5 year old Landseer Newfoundland after our 7 year old Newfoundland passed away earlier this year.
5;Perfect for use while training your dog;The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.
2;Chewy Goey is Chewy Crumbly;I have been waiting for a packaged soft cookie that can recreate the melted yumminess of<br />chocolate chips in a fresh baked cookie. Nabisco has mastered the art of creating melted chips<br />with each bite, but that is as far as it goes.
3;Garden of Eatin' Tortilla Chips, Blue, No Salt Added, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12);This is a good product, BUT, buy the larger bags.  They are the better value.
1;Made in China;Unfortunately, for the safety of our pets we will no longer feed them ANY treats made/processed in China. This treat, while a great size for cats, is in fact made in China.
5;Great tea for the money;Great tea for the price. I wouldn't consider it to be a true gourmet tea, but it's great to keep in the pantry for every day use.
3;Doesn't hold flavor;This gum goes flat really quick. I have searched around for some great tasting xylitol gum that holds its flavor longer than a few minutes and haven't found any.
4;Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem;My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.
5;Made in USA or not?;Have been buying this product for some time now - saw complaints about made in USA or not so I called the company. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice.
5;If you like lemongrass, you'll LOVE this tea...;So I'll admit I'm addicted to all things lemongrass and this tea is no different. It has just the right amount of lemongrass to satisfy my insatiable craving and, the perfect balance of black tea to remind me that I'm having a nice cup-a.
3;The taste isn't quite right...;I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs..
5;Try it!;I have never seen this flavor in the stores.  I do enjoy Sour Cream potato chips, so I thought I would give this a try even though I'm not a big fan of cream sauces.
5;As good as it gets;Great cofee, great price, especially when you use Amazon subscription service.  Can't go wrong with Gloria Jean's if you like mild.
5;Best smoke flavor available;"This is the best smoke flavoring I have found anywhere.  I looked everywhere for similar items but nothing matches the smoky tang of Spice Islands ""Old Hickory Smoke Salt""."
5;Great Protein Bar.;On the go all the time, but still want to eat healthy? Are you sick of all the dry, mediceney tasting protein bars? Then these Power Crunch bars are for you. Seriously, the best bars I have EVER had.
5;Comes as advertised, works like it should.;Use it when making my homebrew beer. Add to taste when bottling for a nice orange flavor without having to zest several oranges.
5;TOO CUTE!!!;These little sugar bees were the hit of the cake.  They were such a cute addition to my Winnie the Pooh cake.
3;Very good, but not fantastic;O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers.
5;Love the taste!  Love Hazelnuts!;I grew up eating these cookies.  Got a case for a great price.
5;Great snack!;These date paste filled cookies are absolutely delicious. They're more cakes than cookies, but either way, it's a filling snack that is simply delicious.
3;"salty ""unseasoned"" tenderizer";"I took the name ""Adolph's Unseasoned Tenderizer"" at face value and ruined a dish by sprinkling this tenderizer on the chicken plus salting it prior to cooking. When I couldn't understand why it was so salty, I read Adolph's ingredients for ""Unseasoned"" and found out that salt was ONE of the seasonings included in the ""Unseasoned"" tenderizer."
5;Wheatena is still the best!;From childhood on, I have considered Wheatena to be the best tasting hot cereal I have eaten.  It has been difficult to find in local stores in recent years and I have now placed two orders with Amazon.
5;54 coffee pod;Great storage container for the coffee. Holds plenty and drawers don't fall out easily when digging to the back.
5;Guilty pleasure...;My favorite candy by far.  Just the right amount of chocolate and peanut.
1;Don't expect prompt service;I was totally shocked by the cost of shipping which was higher than the cost of 10 of the item.  Then to pay that much to find out it has taken nearly a month to receive the product is ridiculous.
4;Sweet & Chocolatey;I liked the taste of this one. On the box they made it look like the biscuts would have chocolate gushing out, but it didn't.
5;Love it!;There's nothing about this sauce I don't like. Spicy, tasty, good.
2;You can do better homemade;I paid 3.49 at the grocery store for this, which made me almost not buy it.
5;My second bag from here.;It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body.
5;# Best Tortilla Chips on the Market, Period #;I love Mexican food, especially when you are waiting on your main course to come and the place you are eating serves up piping hot tortilla chips with salsa.  This is almost impossible to replicate from out of a store shelf, in a cold bag, however, after trying these On The Border chips, I will say, this is the closest thing to restaurant style chips I have ever had.
3;Very hot, but you are guaranteed heartburn;If you want the hottest chip available, its right here.  Taste is pretty good, but it is overwhelmed by the heat.
5;great for energy @ amazon .com;For those of you who like coffee, but have never tried chocolate covered coffee beans usually referred to as CHOCOLATE COVERED ESPRESSO BEANS. I will tell you that eating your coffee is better than drinking it.
5;High price BUT a great cup of coffee...;Simply the best K-cup I've sampled so far (and I've sampled many).  If you like bold, rich coffee than you should definitely try this one.
5;Peanut butter lover;I love peanut butter. Losing weight didnotgowithmy consumption, this is an enjoyable low calorie way to eat peanut butter.
4;A special marmalade for special tastes;After all these years, Frank Cooper and Co. still make the most wonderful marmalades in the world.
3;Tasty, but not decaff;So, I like chocolate covered espresso beans.  Like is probably too weak a word.
5;Fantastic stuff!;My cat loves these treats! He goes nuts for the. They are a very good alternative to the treats with a ton of ingredients and calories.
5;Wonderful product!;I was looking to supplement my breastmilk, but was having a horrible time finding something that worked.  I tried at least 8 different formula's  including the new Alimentum, but this was the only formula that my son could tolerate physically and still tasted good to him.
5;Great taste;Whoa..
1;People consider this refreshing?;I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink.
3;If you like Slim Jim you won't like this;I purchased this because I had cravings for Slim Jims and read a review claiming that these were similar to Slim Jim. Well, I just received it and after one bite I realized these were NOTHING like Slim Jim.
2;Good taste but not so great packaging......Buy with some reservation;I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.
5;Awesome Product;These things are awesome.  These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well.
4;Can't Believe This Is Sugar Free!;While this Cider is sugar free, I wouldn't know it unless I saw the packaging.  It's still a little too sweet for my liking, but that's just me (hence 4 stars instead of 5).
5;16lb dog LOVES;My 16lb pug/min pin dog loves to chew and this satisfies his need. The only complaint I have is that when he gets distracted while chewing it drops on the floor and it's so LOUD.
5;Best Caramel in the UNIVERSE;If you like Caramels, this is the only PERFECT Caramel IN THE WORLD. Nothing else comes close to comparing.
2;Paper thin and messy;These rawhides are paper thin and make a wafer-like mess all over when my dog chews them. They might be the right size, but when it comes to weight they are way too thin.
1;Container was leaking upon arrival -- it was a mess!;I run a professional bakery and must have product arrive secure and without damage in order to use it. This container arrived and the seal was broken -- dripping everywhere and creating quite a mess.
5;Great snack, good ingredients, healthy alternative;So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.
5;Best choice;This is the second time I have ordered Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower Honey and for obvious reasons.  It has a smooth, almost creamy texture with a rich taste.
3;Just Ok..;I accidentally ordered these bars from YesWeAre2%4Change and they were crunchy and crumbly. Literally every bar I opened had already fallen apart inside the wrapper.
1;the worst of the three;I bought these, and while I'm glad I tried them, I wouldn't ever buy them again.<br /><br />I'm serious about my bacon, and I've tried all three of the available maple bacon lollipops: Man Bait, Lollyphile, and Roni Sue, and of the three these are the last ones you should buy.
5;Another superb product from Nutiva!;It is what it is but I've noticed some differences between the white and the black.  I don't know if it's psychological but I swear the white ones fluff up more in water and there is less crunch in the final bite.
5;Great Tea;If you buy this tea in the stores you can't go wrong getting it here..
5;Brown Rice Crackers - Wheat and Gluten Free;This is a great product for those of us with wheat and gluten allergies.  It's crunchy, has great flavor, and a real treat.
3;Very sweet & a little misleading;While this is a tasty tea I found that it was a little too sweet for one 16 oz bottle of water. I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more.
5;It's so good.;This tea is really. It's just as good as the lapsang tea I've gotten from an upscale NYC coffee house.
1;Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED;Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.
5;AWESOME !;I was introduced to this beverage by a family member. Being a person who has to watch their sugar intake, I was delighted to discover this beverage and even more excited to find in on Amazon.
5;The best season salt;Johnny's is the best season salt. Can't find it out here on the east coast, but always bought it when on the west coast.
4;Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!;I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter.
1;nasty surprise;This is disscusting nasty and it even looks unappeling to me.  none of my friends even liked it.
5;My favorite gluten-free pasta;"I've tried many types of pasta for my gluten-free diet.  This is the only spaghetti I've found that tastes and feels like ""normal"" pasta."
5;An excellent healthy choice.;This cereal taste good, is gluten free and mixes well with other cereals.  A very healthy choice.
5;Better than Tijuana Mamas;Like other reviewers, I loves me some Tijuana Mamas. But I just recently discovered these, and I like them even better.
5;Good Stuff;I bought this at a small market near Mayfield KY and loved it. Ordering from Amazon will save me gas and I have Prime so no shipping charges.
5;Great addition for backpacking trips & those super long flights!;The small size pouches are perfect for taking backpacking & pouring into the water packs when needed.<br />Also I travel a lot & prefer Gatorade over any of the airline drinks.
4;yum;I drink a fair amount of tea, and black 'breakfast tea' is one of my faves. I prefer to drink it plain/black.
5;Incredible!;I've tried all of the flavors, and they are amazing. Not sweet, and so flavorful, a complete meal in a bar.
5;BOUGHT 2 BOXES, YES I AM A SHAMELESS ADDICT OF THESE!!!;I bought 2 boxes of these bars last Summer and must have gained 20 lbs. cos I only gave away a few.
4;A good purchase for the price.;I bought this formula for my two month old daughter for night time feeding. It is good to have this present at all times.
4;My Cat Loves Grass!;My cat loves grass.Also houseplants,plastic shower curtains,beads and many other odd items.
5;Good product, but......;I've been a fan of this product for about 12 years now..
5;Very enjoyable;I'm really enjoying this tea.  I've ordered several different flavors from this company and so far all have been great.
4;"Very nice and doesn't smell ""mediciney""";"My husband has a moderate to severe dandruff problem, and since he's been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1, I haven't noticed those telltale flakes on his shoulders or on the sofa upholstery where his head has rested. I like it! He likes it too, and says it works well and doesn't smell ""mediciney."
5;Great product;I still carry regular treats in my pocket but this product is great. It is like a deodorant roll top.
5;Its nice to see these again;This review is based on my experience with the shipper British Delights. I ordered these Jaffa Cakes on the 25 and received them on the 28th.
1;Whole case of dented cans;When I got the case of Ranch Style beans, almost every can was dented.  Not from this shipping either.
3;Quality varies;I have bought these twice now. The first order was great, great flavor, crunchy, very fresh tasting.
4;Good swap for peanut butter;I have only tried the Chocolate PB2, and after reading all the rave reviews, I was hoping it would be a little better.  I won't say I was disappointed, because it's still fine to use instead of peanut butter, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.
4;Great Northern PopCorn;The popcorn is good but if you want outstanding continue looking. It isn't overly buttery and if your wondering 1- 8oz bag makes 7- 1 1/2 oz bags.
5;Great natural treat and my 4 dogs love them!;My dogs love the flavor of these treats and I like the large size so I can split them up between 2 dogs. There are smaller ones in there I like to give to my dachshunds.
5;Delicious;I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since.
4;Great product but definitely not unscented!;I took off 1 star as it states unscented - it is very scented! Extreme fishy smell, but the cats like fish, so it actually enhances some of the bland smelling canned foods to entice them. I squirt the recommended amount on at least 1 of their 2 meals per day.
5;Bob Minsky;For years I have tried to eliminate caffine as advised by my doctor. I tried Eight O'clock Decaffinated whole bean and enjoyed the full flavor.
5;Success!;Passed the test - Made my dad very happy. He was very pleased with the amount and quality of the pistachios.
4;A Decent Cup of Chai Tea;It needs a lot of sugar and milk, but this is a pretty good tea.  It looses one star because, like all the others I have tried, it fails to be as good as the restaurants make it.
5;I Love It!!! Very good flavor...;I love this tea. Whether it's 6 ounces over ice or 12 ounces hot I think it's great.
1;Mango is the only one we could eat;My recomendation is to get the mango and only mango. The rest you are better off buying other brand of dried fruit.
5;Fun and functional;I drink many kinds of loose teas, and this has worked great for all of them. Occasionally some small particles get through the small holes of the ceramic filter, but I think that it is probably not realistic to expect perfection on that front.
4;Tasty and Satisfying;"I received my pack of Kind Healthy Grains Clusters in a firm, cardboard ""envelope"" that protected it enough that it was not pulverized as some reviewers had experienced.  The cereal had varying sized clusters of fruit and grains as well as some loose, individual ones, similar to other granolas."
5;Exellent diplay for the ages;First, I would like to agree that this is a limited time item and I was lucky enough to get one.  The display is amazing that I almost wanted to drink them but reframed from it.
5;best orangettes and great prices;even it is abit expensive to buy sometimes, but I find that the quality is exceptional, great taste, great packaging, and still cheaper than some other brands with a better taste. The texture and taste are just right!<br />The shipping comes in 2 days, great wrap and bow like its for a present, comes in a foam box.
5;Perfect for lunches;My kids love these. It is great for lunches.
5;Paw Lickin' meal;The cats couldn't lick their paws enough after eating this cat food. I highly recommend it.
5;I have found the tea.;This tea is fantastic.  Like another here, I am passing bags out to as many people as I can find.
3;Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7;I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day.
4;good stuff;this is a nice rhubarb and ginger. not the best--could use a little more rhubarb for my taste.
2;Weirdest thing ever;First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog.
4;Nice taste, but sugar level is high;This switch kiwi berry tasts like the Red-Bull energy drink..
5;Excellent Quality;
5;FABULOUS!;My husband read that coconut oil may be effective in treating Alzheimer's Disease and asked me to order some.  It is cholesterol-free with no trans-fats.
4;excellent;I wanted to find an alternative to coffee to avoid the sugar & cream, and this product fits exactly that.<br />It was delivered on time, and the taste was excellent.
5;Outstanding product and service;My wife and I are dark chocolate snobs (Scharffenberger and Organic Trader Joe's Dark are our favorites) and so when we went low-carb we began hunting for alternatives.  Everything we tried was sorely lacking, either with an odd taste, bad texture, or causing serious stomach upset.
5;antiozidant on the go;Product is very good and easy to use.  Can't beat the taste and convience.
5;Great on oatmeal;I like maple sugar for flavoring homemade oatmeal and other things, and Coombs is generally good quality maple products. If you haven't tried maple sugar, you're missing out.
5;Tasty and Healthy;A dog trainer suggested we switch to grain free dog food for our two dogs. The young Jack Russell mix not picky at all, but the elderly Shih Tzu will sometimes refuse to eat.
1;Don't waste your money.;I trusted the other good reviews, but this tastes awful and has a bad aftertaste.  Yuk.
5;The best chili ever;I've been using this chili kit for years. You won't believe how good it comes out every time.
5;KEEPER!;These were a big family hit.<br />They have a bigger fruit taste<br />than non-organic.
3;Nutiva shelled hempseed bad. Nutiva Organic hempseed good!;I ordered this product by accident and I paid for it. It has a bad bitter and spicy flavor to it even the aroma is different.
3;My Dog Likes It;I tried this with one of my dogs toys.  Sadly the drops came out pretty fast and the toy turned a strange brown.
4;Excellent but I wouldn't call it the greatest;Today, making bread, I caught a whiff of the fruity aroma of this oil.  It's a nice olive oil, clear, light, very good to excellent quality.
3;????????????????????????????;Not sure what to say..
5;Delicious - nutritious - amazing alternative to fatty potato chips;My husband and I are big fans of hummus, so when we saw hummus chips we had to try them.  Little did we know they would become our favorite crunchy snack.
5;Best coffee for sensitive stomachs;I have a very sensitive stomach and I'm not sure why. Coffee can sometimes cause great discomfort.
5;A new standard;There are no substitutes for quality fresh ingredients.  Ginger snaps are one of my favorites and these are as good as any homemade cookie recipes I have tried.
5;THE best Jerky around!!;This Sweet Spicy Thai Jerky is the best!! Can't find it in local stores, so I got 2 packs. Not too spicy, but lets you know there is a little heat to it.
2;Not terrible, but way too sweet;I don't want to say these are bad cookies, but I'm not impressed at all.  I guess I should have checked the label more carefully to notice that they were more than a quarter sugar.
3;Needs more specific information in the description;I try to buy organic products whenever possible
5;great bags;I try to do what's right by mother earth. I also want to be courteous to my neighbors.
4;Ok...to be honest...;Not as bad as I was anticipating. For what these noodles are (virtually no calories - gluten free - free food), they are wonderful.
5;Gone in a Flash;This was a Valentine's Day present for my son.  Not your typical fare, but he loved it.
4;Taste a little different, but great to have....;These do taste a bit different than (not as good as) the regular Rice Krispies, but I'm so glad to finally have a gluten-free option.  Haven't made rice krispy treats with them yet, but looking forward to it.
5;Comfort;I find the Lipton Spring Vegetable Cup-a-Soup<br />to be an excellant product.  It is tasty, easy to<br />make, and VEGETARIAN.
5;Dark Magic is a great cup of coffee;I am just 1 week into owning my Kuerig B60 and this was in the sample pack. When I brewed it up, coffee grounds were in the cup and I was hoping this was just one faulty package.
4;They only send one container not four as written in description.;They sent only 1 96oz container not four like advertised.  I thought the price was a little too good to be true, just wanted to let everyone else know.
5;Healthy!  Banana is another winner.;1st is lime.  So simple and good.
4;A very nice, smooth, Americano style coffee;I bought a Wolfgang Puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites, so I ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it.  This is a classic, medium-roast cup of coffee.
5;ToxiClenz;Really liked this product.  Gentle but effective cleanse for those who have heavy metal problems and/or parasites.
5;My Favorite Flavor;I've tried several of the Simply Asians and this is my favorite. It has a sharp, high spicy piquant taste that is uniquely Chinese and I love it.
5;sweet;I use this instead of sugar on my morning oat meal.<br />It makes a big difference in taste.
5;Altoids Cinnamon;These are excellent. I buy them in bulk from Amazon (vs.
4;Healthy food for a healthy baby!;I really was impressed with this product.  If you are an adult and you try it before giving it to your baby you have to remember that they have not been used to the salt (sodium) and sugar flavors we are used to so just because you may think this is bland, your baby will  probably still like it just fine.
5;Top-notch organic dog food.;Newmans beef organic beef never fails.  My pooch (miniature poodle) never fails to gobble it up along with the premium kibbles I feed her.
1;too expensive too few;I was very disappointed with the meringue mushrooms. There were only 6 in one box and 7 in the other, they were very small and I felt like I was really paying for the packaging.
5;Simply delicious;These are tasty, different and very original snacks. The tomato flavor is great! We started with just two boxes (each contains four small packages) and it is just not enough.
5;Excellent breakfast tea!;I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.
5;Perfect Pasta!;We like this pasta BETTER than regular, high-carb pasta.  I always keep a stock of it and all the other types Dreamfields offers.
2;Great Taste, but then FAIL from there;I love ginger snaps and was excited to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.  At first taste you cannot distinguish these cookies from any other quality ginger snaps on the market.
5;Great treats;These treats are perfect for training. They taste AMAZING - I eat them myself, too! They're small, they dissolve quickly, and they're fairly smelly.
5;these are so good...;These rice cakes are so good.  I feel like I am eating a cross between a nori roll (seaweed) and a rice cake.
1;Not Italian or French;"When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled ""from Italy"". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China."
5;This is hands-down, my favorite coffee on my Keurig coffee maker.;Hi!  I have that coffee maker at home - the Keurig thing.  I love it.
5;One of the very best candies ever;I found Violet Crumble in a shop about 25 miles from home one time. I always look for new taste treats, and this one looked interesting.
5;Horsetail Grass Tea;Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.
5;Great flavor;This brand has a wonderful, deep and rich molasses flavor. I was very impressed by the quality of the product.
4;Great for toddlers! They are yummy, but don't completely mask the veggie flavor;"My son is 16 months and, while he is a balanced and good eater, I still feel he needs more vegetables during the day.  I try to send portions of canned veggies to day care (which, sadly, are his favorite -- I think it's because they're soft and he only has 5 teeth -- I buy the ""no salt added ones""), but I don't think they really worry about whether he eats the veggies as long as he eats SOMETHING."
5;Ginnyk;LOVE Gu and love GU roctane.  Price is right and shipment was super fast.
3;Needs some work;The flavor is okay, but the muffins just fall apart.  They literally just crumble into tiny grainy pieces, so it's very hard to actually eat one.
5;Even Better than the Busha Browne Rub;I originally bought the Busha Browne Jerk rub.  While finding it to be authentic and hot, I wanted to be able to marinade the chicken so I bought the sauce.
5;Summer sussage;I had this basket before and the Summer sussage and Hot mustard is delish.  My hubby told me make sure we hv that again for Christmas Eve.
5;amish country purple popcorn;Love this popcorn. It is the only one we eat at this house! And I guess amazon is the only place I will order it from now on.
5;Cat begs to clean teeth!;My geriatric cat loves these treats. He begs every time I sit down at my desk (treats are stored in a drawer).
5;sbd meal bar;I was pleasantly surprised at how good these<br />are.  They have a great texture and I really liked the Peanut Butter<br />and chocolate combination.
5;Dogs go crazy for this;As another reviewer noted..
4;Coffee review;We did not know that this item came with cream already in it. My husband likes it better without the cream.
4;Great for older babies;So I bought these when my baby was 7 or 8 months old thinking that these would be a great starter snack food and an alternative to Cheerios (which I hadn't yet given to my baby). These are not a melt in your mouth type of early baby snack.
4;Tasty product, bad packaging;Ghirardelli cocoa is the best I've tasted, and this combination of chocolate and cocoa is particularly good. When my local stores stopped carrying it, I had to start buying online.
2;Not happy with this product...;The crackers were all broken up and in crumbs.  I felt like I completly wasted my money buying this.
5;Wow Good Coffee!!!;I was surprised at how great this coffee tasted and for .40 a cup it is also very economical considering they sell for .
5;Tea, proper English Tea.;What more can a person ask for when they have a good cuppa in their hand?<br />The boxes may be huge and the subscription of getting two big boxes of tea might sound like you are ready to open a tea room but it isn't.  The tea is fresh so it will last a fair amount of time and the price is the best I have found short of walking into an ASDA in the UK!  480 Tea bags is not that much when you do the math.
5;Mixing~~;i am totally in love with this cereal. i mix the brown sugar and the cin.
1;Never received product;A blogger friend of mine tried out PB Crave and posted rave reviews. Being a huge peanut butter fan myself I decided to order this for an upcoming camping trip.
5;Relief for sore throat in Suzhou, China;I was teaching at the Suzhou, China technical college when I developed a sore throat/cold. The faculty brought me Golden Throat Lozenge drops that worked wonders for me, especially helping me to stop coughing in the middle of the night.
5;Great Colombian Coffee;Peet's Colombia Ground Coffee is earthy, well-balanced and has that fresh aroma which characterizes the very best Colombian coffee.  This coffee while not overpowering is robust and rounded.
5;Grrrrreat!;My two cats can't get enough of this food. They will eat and seem to enjoy several of the other BFF flavors, but with this one they hardly pause to inhale.
5;Salt & Pepper Popchips are the BEST!!!;I love this product. I like some of the other flavors, but this one is the very best.
5;good taste and better than a snickers bar for you;There bars are pretty tasty.  But you are never going to find something that is nutritious and tastes better than a candy and chemical bar.
5;best rice bound chicken kibble;"this is the highest animal protein % rice bound kibble on the market.  It's low dust 3/8"" round shape will work perfectly in any mechanical food dispenser."
5;good deal;we use a lot of old bay during the summer. We are always eating crabs, and other types of seafood, and oldbay is a must.
5;Jivara Lactee 3kg;For a milk chocolate, truly a great one! Try it. Very high quality.
2;Not what I was looking for;I was looking for some jasmine extract to make some thai desserts with.  When I opened this bottle of jasmine extract, it sort of smelled like jasmine, but also had some other weird (not so great) smell to it.
4;Pretty Good Decaf;I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.
5;pineapple & coconut chicken \o/;I've tried many of the Zatarain's products and liked most of them, but this one is quite different. It's not anywhere near as salty as the others - in fact, it's rather on the sweet side.
1;smells like cat pee;this smells so strong like cat urine i can't even bring myself to drink it . .
4;Nutiva organic coconut oil;This is a really nice value, and a delicious product. Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat.
5;DELICIOUS!;These meal replacement bars are no joke. They are THE best protein bars I have ever had.
5;Finally a K-Cup that makes a bigger cup of coffee;Because this Fog Chaser K-Cup makes a very strong regular (a.k.
2;Starts off weak, gets worse;The back of the bag tells you to use two tablespoons or coffee for every 6 ounces of water when brewing this coffee. I did that, and the vanilla taste was very weak.
5;Healthier Cookie With A Decadent Taste!;Fresh..
5;best on the market;This is my first time trying thie item.  I tried splenda which is good but each dry packet is 1 carb.
4;Lovely tea, horribly packed;This is one of my favorite winter teas! The ginger-peach flavor is absolutely wonderful, especially when I have a cold or flu. Next time, I won't order this specific packaging.
5;A Great change from other chips -- Tasty and Healthy;Like another reviewer, I've had sweet potato fries at a restaurant and thought they were great.  My boss says that sweet potatoes are actually better then regular ones for people trying to watch their sugar levels.
5;Best freaking lemon tea ever! Bam!;This one will put a pucker on your lips and a smile in your heart.  I have found a new tea to love, especially if it is iced tea.
1;ordered sugar free decaf.. and got something different;I was a bit upset at the fact that i had ordered sugar-free decaf international coffee's and got decaf with sugar..
5;Delicious;I like all of the Food Should Taste Good varieties that I have tried (Multigrain, Jalapeno, Sweet Potato, and Olive). They are delicious, but also low sodium, all natural, and vegan.
5;Good Stuff !  Excellent taste and consistancy;Simply good Bulgar wheat. Cook it up and serve in place of rice.
5;very heallthy;I started eating this bread when I lived in Holland. At first I didn't like it, now I have 2-3 slices a day w/sunflower seed butter & apricot jam.
4;Great to drink after dinner;This Melitta Riviera Sunset blend is a nice, and light coffee that is suitable for anytime of day.  It's particularly great for drinking at night because it is decaffeinated.
5;Best Senseo Pods Available IMHO;Having gone through what I believe to have been every available pod for the Senseo brewer, I am convinced that this blend is by far the best. A nice potent blend with great flavor, aroma, and crema.
5;Angostura Bitters;When my local stores stopped carring Angotura Bitters I tried another brand and was dissatisfied with the taste. Then I found I could by it through Amazon.
5;Can't go wrong;"We love Great Northern Popcorn, we use it for fundraising and at home for our ""movie night"".  It is easy to use and it is premeasured."
5;Tasty and healthy!!;My husband and I love Coach's Oats.  We first tried them on recommendation by a friend.
5;Full of flavor and freshness;I was hesitant to buy this because other reviewers had said it was bland, but boy were they wrong. This soup is packed with flavor.
5;Natural calm Plus;I have been taking Natural Calm Plus for about 2 years. I have a milk intolerance and IBS.
2;I liked it at first...;The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it.
4;It really works.;I give this supplement to my son before bed every night.  I was advised that Magnesium can aid in preventing headaches and migraines.
5;Good flavor, convenient package;We use Amazing Grass ORAC Green SuperFood and I purchased these to take on vacation.  This is my favorite flavor/texture + health benefits of all the Amazing Grass drink mixes and the packaging made it very convenient to take on the plane without being questioned about the strange powdery stuff in baggies stuffed in my luggage.
2;Salty and a tad boring;I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer.
4;A tad bitter with a smooth mouth feel;This is my first experience with Vivani chocolate.  It is a bit more bitter (or maybe just less sweet?) than I am used to with 72% dark chocolate (in comparison to Endangered Species 72% for example).
5;quaker chewy granola bars sixty bar variety;product has been around for quite awhile. we have had it before.
5;Great Pop Chips;"These Pop Chips are great!  Love them, even low in WW points.<a href=""http://www."
5;I love this cinnamon!;I've been hearing about the health benefits of true ceylon cinnamon and wanted to begin using it in food and teas.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered online.
3;Easy to Prep One Pan Meal;This product is a bit of a change for me. I live in a home with, other than me who'll eat anything, an organic vegan wife and an organic vegetarian daughter.
5;Cornnuts vs driving buying 24 cornnuts!;Buying in bulk: Im not going to what one flavor. Im eating a classic stack in 4 flavors
5;very good;popcorn is very good.  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story.
5;Scrumptious;Soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added. It's a great, nutritious, high-calcium, no cholesterol product at a great price.
5;Best breakfast ever;For years I have loved getting the Swedish Crepes from IHOP.  Everytime we went I would get this dish.
4;Yum!;We don't have a pod brewer so we put a couple of these in the coffeepot and brewed water thru it. Yum!  Normally I like a strong coffee, and this was milder than my usual, but the flavor was terrific! Very smooth and totally delicious.
1;Horrible!;My experience with this was a disaster. The first push on the applicator sent gobs of the bait all over the place.
4;My cats favorite food;I use to get this product at my local Petsmart until they no longer carried it other than in a variety pack.  The Mackeral is their favoite and my cats were soooo upset when I couldn't get it.
5;Canned Kitty food;One of my cats developed a urinary tract infection that caused both of us great suffering.  Kitty was two years old and I had only ever fed her dry food.
3;Same price as stores, lesser product;I am a fan of the double bergamot stash earl grey from stores in packs of 18.  This bulk box does not contain the same quality product.
5;most excellent;Prince of Wales is an excellent blend of tea leaves.  The supplier responded quickly with a quality product.
5;Maple extract at last!!!!!;I'm so thrilled to have found maple extract online. I can hardly ever find it at the grocery stores
3;Healthy snack misses the mark;I try to choose healthy snacks when I have the option, and I was pleased to see this brand available in a variety pack.  While these fruit snacks are easy to tote around and very good for you, the taste and texture missed the mark with me.
5;Sooooo good;These lollipops are so good! Nice old fashion candy. Almost addicting actually.
5;My 15 yr old cats love this!;I had been feeding them Pro Plan for years, but when they were both diagnosed with dental fissures a couple of months ago, I started researching brands that would be easier for them to eat.  This kibble is made smaller and breaks apart easier than the other brand, and they both love it!  I had tried high end brands like Wellness, Core, and a few others in the past, but they wouldn't go near them.
5;They are totally awesome!;I've eaten these for a long time, and they are totally awesome, though not always easy to get hold of (they run out).  Great protein source for a busy vegan like me, plus I am a fitness trainer and workout a lot, so I need the convenient protein.
5;Good flavor;First time ordering this flavor, with excellent results.  Would recommend to others as a smooth blend.
5;Amazing treats!  My pets love them.;We purchase both the Chicken and the Beef Liver for our dogs..
1;Cheese sauce is disgusting;The noodles were fine, it's just the packaged cheese sauce that I found awful. I tried to add things to it to make it edible, but ended up tossing the whole box.
5;I fell in love in Paris;Yes, with this juice. Apparently I'm not the only person who loves this drink, it is the leading orange carbonated soft drink in France.
5;Amazing Margaritas - watch out!;We used this for margaritas - the bottle comes with a recipes.  They are pricey little drinks when you add all the suggested spirits, but for a very special occasion they are worth it.
4;Good, but not great;I was hoping for a sugar-free version of the popular purple grape sodas, with that traditional big purple grape taste.  This soda does not have that.
2;Not worth the money;The potatos and hot dogs are really good..
1;GM ingredients, no thank you!;I haven't tried it, nor will I.  There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.
4;Chocolate + almonds = A match made in heaven!;Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.
1;disk failure;"About 1 out of every 3 disks is bad & to my knowledge there is no reasonable recourse? Tassimo will not pay to have the product shipped back if the ""original"" post office package has been opened? How do you know a product is inferior if you don't open it? Tassimo refused to credit my credit card for unordered merchandise while their website was under revision, refused to pay for unordered return package because the outside envelope had been opened so I could see what was inside, etc. I'm stuck with the coffee maker until it no longer works."
2;Bad for teeth;Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses.
5;Chip A'Hoy;The chips were fresh and shipped safely all the way to Afghanistan and quickly. I would definately order these chips again when I finish the others.
4;A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!;I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.
5;Numbingly Delicious;I added this to some chili that my wife made and it definitely made it hotter (the chili)!  :)  Not only does Scorned Woman hot sauce have the best name of any hot sauce, it adds a tasty lime flavor in with all the hot peppers.  I think I added too much because my mouth went numb after a couple bites and I caught the hiccups.
5;Chai for Chai Lovers;This chai is an everyday tea for me.  I discovered it while on vacation and had a hard time finding it in the stores.
5;Fantastic stuff!;My almost-11-year-old lab (who still believes he is a puppy) struggles with a food allergies and hip dysplasia. We've tried every premium dog food under the sun and just found Innova EVO about a month ago.
3;A good little cookie...;..
1;Harsh;This coffee is burnt tasting.  Like burnt toast.
5;Gotta Have it Natural!!!;Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available, we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area!  It appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting, lightly salted, lower calorie popcorn, but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film.  This popcorn pops fully, leaving no kernels unpopped, and doesn't need any additives.
5;Great snack for our canine friends too!;I have two senior labrador retrievers and have recently become concerned about promoting eye health in their old age.  So I decided to add carrots to their diet.
5;This Gravy is a Great Savings;The Southeastern Mills Country Gravy Mix has the down home country gravy flavor that I use over fresh baked biscuits that we love having for Sunday morning breakfasts.<br /><br />It is a great buy in the 24 count carton.
5;GREAT!;My dog is a picky eater, won't eat most treats, but he loved these..
5;Best I have Tasted;I found this brand and type in my favorite local grocery store. I had been buying the store brand, hand placed regular olives, for some time.
4;Good Product;Love these olives with a little kick.  If you enjoy spicy food and olives these are the item for you.
5;Fresh, Huge, Tasty;Would buy these again. Great quality and freshness.
5;Yummy;I hate eating breakfast.  The nutritionist wanted me to get protein in the morning.
4;"Great taste,all natural ingredients,""iffy"" texture";I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products. When I saw these chips, I jumped at the chance to try something new.
5;Good;I eat these regularly and are especially with heavier sauces.  I use these as much as I can and then I use the lighter ones when I don't want the whole grain flavor to interfere.
5;Superb taste.  Best vanilla extract I've ever used.;I used to buy large bottles of vanilla extract at Sams because the price was so much less than the brand at the supermarket but I thought the flavor was lacking (this was real vanilla, not the artificial stuff).<br /><br />I recently starting making my own ice cream and I wanted the best ingredients.
5;Quick and Easy Dinner!!;The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Dinner is one of the most easiest yet filling meals that I've made in a while. The product uses a creamy cheese rather than the powdered cheese found in other products and this makes a big difference in the taste the seasoning was perfect and I only had to add a small amount of my own seasoning to help.
5;These Nuts are Great when they are plain....;These Nuts are Great when they are plain..
5;Impressive!;I opened these because I was hungry but once I took the first bite I knew this was a slow chewer. Very moist and flavorful jerky with a vivid and accurate teriyaki flavor.
5;The Ice Cream of the Gatorade Line;This is one of the most fantastic beverages I have had the pleasure of tasting. The taste is revolutationary when you compare it to the other flavors.
5;Great value product that is full of protein;We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones.
1;VERY DISAPPOINTED;I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y.
5;Incrediblely Great food with great results.;I order this food to try as it was grain free and I liked the ingredients listed on the site with the reviews. I opened the bag and the smell was incredible.
5;outstanding product;Tasted these bars in a health food store and grabbed several flavors ot Kind bars to try.  The chocolate cherry cashew ones are like crack -- totally addicting!  Amazing blend of tastes makes me feel like I'm sneaking a candy bar instead of a healthy, wholesome friut and nut bar.
3;rather nice, but you may want to try it before buying a whole carton;howdy y'all,<br /><br />i like this and will be buying more. however, it has a flavor that somewhat reminds me of coconut.
5;my kid goes crazy for these;Sure, I wish they were less sugary, but as far as little treats go, I love Annie's fruit snacks. My kid loves every flavor and they are great to keep in my purse for an after school pickup snack, or for a little reward now and then.
4;Smells good;It tastes pretty good.  There's a lot of stems in it, but it doesn't seem to hurt the flavor.
2;Dented cans;I ordered 2 cases of Halo cat food for a total of 24 cans.  Fully half the cans arrived seriously dented to the point that I wonder if the food inside is still viable.
4;Good for a quick snack.;Quaker's Banana Nut Bread is good for when you want banana bread but don't have time to make it homemade. It taste so much better once its been warmed (about 10 seconds in the microwave) and smeared with a little butter.
5;Greek Candy;I like this candy very much and purchase it on a regular basis to keep in the candy dish on my desk.  It is well like by everyone.
1;Sleepy;These dont agree with me and make me lethargic.  I guess processed food is processed food whether organic or not.
4;Spendy...;The pet food can covers work fine for medium/large cans. I should've price shopped around before hand, though.
5;Excellent drink! Wish it wasn't double priced.;IRN-BRU is the drink of Scots next to Whiskey. I am not sure why but last year it was only $16.
5;Winter = Soups;"This is a wonderful addition to soup stocks or packaged ramen in place of the ""flavor packet"". I use it often and enjoy the unique flavor it adds to chicken stock or water."
5;It's good stuff, better than expected.;I usually buy numi green tea mao feng. And the tea from this k-cups is comparable.
5;The BEST chocolate syrup!;I heard of Fox's chocolate syrup in a discussion about the best chocolate syrup.  I was on a cruise and our dining companions were discussing the merits of various chocolate syrups when one of them remarked about Fox's.
5;Convenient;I purchase Twinings English Breakfast Tea for the office. It has a fantastic flavor and is much quicker than heating up the water, etc.
4;hard to find;I needed fenugreek seeds to make my own curry powder..
5;Essential, HONEST Nourishment in a Delicious Flavor Assortment;Ginger Snap is my favorite of the Larabars. For me it seems to provide the epitome of potency these bars have available.
5;Good Stuff!;I got this for my husband because he is a huge fan of sweet tea but He drinks it like its water so I thought I would try a sugar free version for him to try. He really loved it.
5;Out of sight trap;I bought this and in 10 days I had 4 moles.  It took a little time to get things right but when I did WOW!! It works great.
5;Excellent Blend;The Caribou Coffee K-Cup is an excellent blend of strong coffee. It's not for everyone.
4;Not as hot as I expected;All of these peppers are fresh, but only one of them is hot (the habanero flakes). The other five choices are moderately hot and would be tolerable to most folks.
3;A bit too hard;These are supposed to be touched by brown sugar but where?  I am afraid this cereal is also a bit flat for me.  The puffs are not puffy at all they are quite hard and unappealing.
4;Nice, Refreshing Drink;This Crystal Light drink stays right on target just like all the other Crystal Light products my family enjoys.  This drink was nice and refreshing.
1;Weak;Taste is very weak and didn't improve with coffee creamer. Sorry but this box is a dud.
1;WASTE OF MONEY;I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly.
5;very good !;This dish is so good.I just had it an hour ago, I poured the sauce over some japanese rice noodles and added some chicken.
5;Great Stuff!;This food looks like canned stew.  I'd eat it.
5;Perfect Post Workout Shake!!  Delicious!  High Protein!;I tried chocolate and am normally not a vanilla person but since the taste and quality was exceptional, I figured I'd give it a try.  This drink is simply incredible.
4;Excellent for milk tea;This tea is excellent for making milk tea, very close to the one that I get from Chinatown. However, this tea is not good for drinking alone (without milk & sugar), I find it leaves a bitter taste.
5;Best tortilla chips snack, period!;We only buy organic natural foods without any hydrogenated oil or MSG. These chips are the best we have ever tried.
5;A True Delight;After fighting every morning over our lone coffee maker (and not wanting to invest in a K-cup machine), I decided to try this instant coffee for my caffeine-free husband.  He no longer cheats on his doctor's orders.
1;Lame;I was very disappointed with this product. It doesn't have a blinking light or clicking noise to let you know it's working.
3;Could be peachier.;The idea of carrying a neat little container of liquid that allows me to turn a bottle of water into peach tea is good. I was excited to try it.
5;Yummy;My kids really liked these.  Good flavor and good value.
5;Nice flavor and fine grind;A super fine grind that we find works perfectly in our espresso machine. Our decent grinder can't get it this fine and this produces great crema.
5;Definitely helps with dry scalp;There isn't a lot I can say about shampoo, but after using this product (along with the moisturizing dry scalp conditioner) I noticed that my scalp was much less dry and itchy.  The shampoo is thicker than most, but cleans well.
5;Delicious, yet not too sweet;This product is wonderful!  A nice change of pace for those wanting a nice cookie that is tasty, yet not too sweet. It is nice and flavorful, and makes a perfect afternoon or early evening snack with a hot beverage or a cold glass of milk.
5;terrific rice krispie treats;I purchased this hoping to make rice krispie treats that were a little healthier for my kids.  This cereal makes the best rice krispie treats.
5;YUM!  control your own cocoa or mocha coffee sweetness;These are so great.  They are admittedly an acquired taste for a quick munch, but then addictive.
3;Not too sure;Upon first taste of this product it was pretty good. But, the after taste and feeling left in my stomach were not so great.
5;Great!!!;These taste great and look very cool. I scored big time by getting a fresh case at Marshalls for $15.
5;Great for Lattes;This coffee works great for Latte's. Here's how we make it:<br />- Pour 1/3 cup cold milk (Organic 2% works best) into ceramic mug<br />- Add sugar if required<br />- Microwave on high 45 secs (till milk starts to boil)<br />- Froth-up milk using a battery operated stirrer (we bought one real cheap at Ikea)<br />- Prepare K-cup on Medium Setting<br />- Pour over frothed milk & enjoy<br /><br />This recipe makes 2 cups of coffee for one K-cup !<br /><br />You can adjust the amount of milk depending on how strong you like the Latte.
3;Loved the first three cans...;After feeding my recently-acquired cat a case of Wellness Turkey and Salmon without issue, I fully expected her to love the Beef and Salmon as much.  Unfortunately, she loved only the first three cans and won't touch it now without adding some dry food to it.
5;Best made by the pot full, because one cup just isn't enough!!;Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire GOLD is by far, the best English tea that I have drank over the years. I began hoarding this tea after my first visit across the pond more than twenty five years ago and am very pleased to see that it is offered on Amazon at a great price! I just love the flavor which is very smooth and malty, never bitter.
5;Kitties declare it a winner!;The kitties seemed to know the package from Amazon was for them and meowed loudly while I opened it up. Petite Cuisine Variety pack was here!<br /><br />This product comes in a 3 oz can which is just the right size to split between the two cats.
1;Other Flavors are Great, these Not So Much;The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them.
1;"Item advertised is for ""Active Maturity Hairball, and what is received is called ""Mature Adult Hairball"". Deceiving";"Two times this has occured. What is advertised in the product name is not what is received in product ""name"" as stated above."
5;Yummy granola;We love this granola's flavor and texture. We eat it with yogurt, milk, or fruit.
1;I never buy dark chocolate;They sent this to me and I never ordered it cause I don't like dark chocolate at all.Trying to send it back to who sent it.
5;Tasty, Convenient & Economical;My wife and I purchased a Keurig coffee maker a year ago. It's very convenient for us to make coffee one cup at a time and it only takes a few seconds to brew.
5;Finally!!  A good cup of tea in the USA!;I found this recently at Walmart and have practically bought them out!  It is the only worthwhile tea to drink in this country.  I am convinced that the only reason the US prefers coffee is due to the poor quality of tea available here.
4;Best Price on the Web;"Amazon has consistantly been the best price for this ""K-Cup"" type of coffee.  I like the Timothy's but this particular type was just a little strong for me (and I thought I liked strong coffee)."
5;Grren Mountain is Great;I like this company but liek any other company you shouls shop around.  I persomally feel that I shouldn't pay more than .
1;Boycott Proflowers;Most flower purchases are either by women or for women, I cannot believe Proflowers haas not pulled their advertising. Even if Rush signed your paychecks he would pull the ads from his show.
4;Great Ingredients - lousy taste;Great Ingredients - lousy taste<br /><br />I bought this item for its Great Ingredients - but it has a bad taste.<br />I have to mix this cereal with another organic oatmeal so the baby will eat it.
5;Great Coffee;This is a full flavored coffee. It has a great aroma as well.
2;Feed with caution;This review is a generalization of all hoof treats, not an indication that this particular brand is different than others I have tried.<br /><br />Many dogs seem to have little problem with hooves.
5;Wellness Canned Cat food-Turkey Recipe, 12-pack of 12.5 0z. cans;Wellness Turkey Recipe is all our cat will eat.  Wellness is the best rated food on the market.
5;Great coffee.;Love this pumkin spice coffee.  Great flavor and aroma.
5;Canine Testimonial;All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time.
5;Caribou rates #1;I concur with the prior reviewers and independently came to the same conclusion. After going through everything in the variety pak, this particular coffee consistently came out on top.
5;Best Real Pizza Crust in a Gluten Free mix;We absolutely love this french bread and pizza mix, although we love the pizza crust so much we only use it to make pizza!!  We can actually spread the dough thinner, so that we get more than one crust (one large and one small/medium crust).  The only problem is this item is not on subscribe and save.
5;Yummy sauce that is my favorite;This sauce is my absolute favorite. It goes well with beans (black or pinto), makes a tasty burrito topping, and adds a great base flavor for any tomato-based filling.
5;Yummy!;I bought this to make my own version of Starbucks' passion tea at home. It's really yummy!<br /><br />You get A LOT of hibiscus flowers.
4;Great Treat;The mini size is a little too small for my enjoyment.  I prefer bigger gummy bears.
5;Better than the MOVIES and Cheaper;ALL who tried this popcorn loved it and wanted more.  They came back for seconds and waited in line for it.
4;Our dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie;"I have 2 small terriers who aren't really interested in any kind of dog toys (except rawhide ones, which they choke on) but they LOVE Greenies.  I can get them to do almost anything if I mention ""Greenie""."
5;Very flavourful;Lovers of Earl Grey tea come in various varieties. :) Contrary to the norm, I like my Earl Grey strong and sweetened.
5;I love this Crystal Light;This is the best flavor of Crystal Light, ever.  I do not understand why my local stores do not carry it but as long as I can get it from Anazon I am happy.
4;A great protein bar;I think this is a great protein bar.  It tastes better than most I've tried, and it has the perfect amount of protein for me.
5;These are wonderful.;I have three kids, 9 7 and 1. These are the best product I have ever found.
4;Does the job;I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling.
5;Tastes good and Healthy too;I ordered this for a friend that lives a thousand miles from me, she was having some health problems and having used this product before knew it would be helpful and being tasty she would eat and enjoy it as well as derive the benefits it provides.<br /> I highly reccommend this cereal for all , has many advantages to it besides just the capability of filling you up.
5;My Favorite Cold Drink....;I love this tea. I make it strong and mix it with a splash of lemonade.
5;I like it!;Peelu disappeared from the health food store for a while and came back like this. Better! It is a different shape, but that is OK with me.
3;Packaging not good;For a quick grain free breakfast this is a good choice. It is not a fantastic taste but is pretty good.
3;Good treat for my Maltese;These are good, however, my dog likes the duck better . .
5;Great Treat for my cat;We have a bunch of different appetizers in our cabinet and my cat loves them all. They are just meat or fish and water and provide a great protein supplement in conjunction with our cat's regular diet.
5;Good Stuff;This will be stocked in my pantry from now on.  Very versatile.
4;No Complaints;"This doggie food was similar to the one she (the dog) was having before in that it was the dried one. She is pretty much skeptical of her diet however upon introducing the ""Beneful"" she took to it at once."
5;My favorite bagged black tea;For a bag tea--which generally are not as good quality, this brews up like a top quality loose tea. It's a delicious snappy black blend, with a lovely scent and taste.
5;Greenies Dental Chews;Greenies (96) were received quickly in a protective box. They were fresh in a resealable bag.
1;PILL POCKETS ALL BROKEN UP;The pill pockets were all broken up into little pieces.  I have to put them together and wrap them around the capsules.
5;Tazo Tea;The tea is delicious..
5;The best of Cameron's;"We sent Woods and Water as well as <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Full of salty sugary goodness in every bite;I got a free sample of this in the mail.<br /><br />This has a delightful crunch, better than any crunch I've experienced in a breakfast cereal.
1;Terrible;I don't know why they're so many good reviews, but this popcorn is terrible!! Nothing like the movie theatres popcorn..
5;Great for my dog;I give my dog pumpkin every to help control his weight.  With the pumpkin shortage, that has been very hard to do.
3;I wasn't very impressed...;I'm not a regular customer of 'energy' products.  In the past I've ordered and reviewed another pre-made energy drink.
5;Fun Game;We have played this with three adults.  fun game that does not take too long to play.
5;Tanka Bites;I really love these.  It just feels healthier while eating than mainstream jerky bites.
4;Not too shabby for a health powder;Yes, this powder is essentially grass and all that good stuff you can't bear to stomach on it's own. But if you know that going into trying it, it's not so bad.
5;Good stuff;I usually make my popcorn on the stove but when I got a popcorn machine I quickly noticed you can't use the same methods and decided to buy these packets.  The popcorn doesn't come out the same as when I make it on the stove but it is good nonetheless (a diff type of good) plus much less hassle.
5;no more stale chips;i like nachos. i don't like stale chips.
2;Low Carb Angel Food Puffs;I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one.
5;Love it!;We really enjoy the taste.  The chocolate is not too strong, rather well balanced with the hazelnut flavor.
5;Yogourmet Probiotic Starter;I just made yogurt with this starter and it was great.  I left it to incubate for 19 and a half hours instead of the recommended time, because I forgot it.
5;Excellent product!;I've taken magnesium for years, quality brands, and know it is helpful for my health problems.  I just tried this brand this time and was amazed at how quickly after drinking it I felt very calm and relaxed.
1;Doesn't taste that great;I decided to try Xylitol since I've been using Spenda for a few years and heard this sweetner was better. I was really disappointed.
5;Finally, a GF everyone wil eat!;I'm not GF myself, and this is the first GF brownie mix I've tried that wasn't either weird in texture or downright gross. These taste like.
5;One of the best single cup servings available;If you like a bold yet smooth coffee, this is the one for you.  I didn't expect much from a single serve product because I had another product with similar features.
5;So Versatile and Yummy;This is one bread product that both the gluten free and non gluten free family members in my house love.  I don't even make any gluten corn bread anymore.
4;I'm a fan;I got a good deal on this from the Amazon warehouse, so I jumped on it.  I'm not at all disappointed.
5;Not hype, just delicious tonic;Like many of you, I drank my way through a survey of gins until I found the one that suited me best. (Tanqueray, in my case.
5;Preserved lemons;These are great as I use them in chicken Tajine. One bottle leaked all over the inside of the shipping box.
5;Drmamy;I used to buy this item from Whole Foods for about $8 a pouch. I am so happy that I find it on amazon for much cheaper price with subscribtion and of course a free shipping .
5;Recommended by Tim Ferris, I second it!;I read about this in the Four Hour Body by Tim Ferriss, and though I doubted nut oil could be a winner with my salmon & scrambled eggs (I don't eat them together), he was right. This is great.
5;Just what I wanted;Wissotzky Magic Tea Chest, Assorted Tea Collection w/ 80 Assorted Tea's<br /><br />I was impressed with the selection and really liked the tea flavors. Delicious and aromatic.
5;I love Dragon Pearl Tea;I love the flavor and the quality of the white loose tea. Dragon Pearl Tea is by far my favorite tea, i havent tasted any tea like it.
4;Nice for an afternoon break;Right up front: I like this drink, even though I usually don't want my coffee tampered with: No sugar, No milk or cream, No frothing, No cinnamon, No nonsense.<br /><br />This has a definite espresso flavor and is very sweet.
5;A good base;I use this sauce as a base when I need to make satay sauce in a hurry and don't have time to create any from scratch. Out of the pouch its rather bland, I assume because its all natural with no added salt.
3;Hmmm..;These were very tender, but too salty for my taste. They weren't as salty as the Teriyaki ones though.
5;Wow;Best maple syrup I have had.  Im not a pro and bought some at cosco and threw out what was remaining when this arrived.
5;Great Honey Sticks!;These are the greats treat.  My grandkids enjoy them as well as my daughters and myself.
4;Quantity of tea included;I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight.
4;Delicious!;BBQ Pop Chips are a delicious tasting healthier chip than many on the market.  They are light and full of flavor.
5;Simply Wonderful Organic Turmeric !;I received the case of this spice very timely and love the quality.  All I need to do is heat it up and add pepper and I have the start to not only a great dish but healthy nutrient as well .
5;Good price, roomy, easy to open;I like using these bright bags because I walk my dog at a popular park and I want people to know I pick up after him. I don't want someone stepping in a mess, much less glaring at me thinking it was my dog!<br /><br />I've never had a bag break and they are easy to open.
1;Great except for one huge design flaw;I got the Beaba Babycook as a gift, and adored it for several weeks. I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans.
4;I LOVE THESE CRACKERS!!;Now that I got the caps out of my system, yes, I love these crackers. They have this magical taste-smell and it is just marvelous.
5;Glad to find it on Amazon!;We've used this product for years, and when our last industrial sized container ran out, we could no longer find it in the stores.  Amazon to the rescue!  This stuff is great for seasoning chicken.
3;seem fattier than corn chips;I am gluten and dairy allergic so I am always looking for variety.  These are okay but they seem fattier than corn chips.
4;A great gift for a vegan, or anyone trying a healthier diet;A friend's daughter has just gone to college.  Now that she's there she's decided to go vegan and can't find anything but potato chips to eat.
3;Great but....;The rice tastes amazing. Best I've ever had.
5;Quite Simply......;The very best black tea there is! I agree that there are a few good black teas, but if consistency and a deep, rich, delicious quality in a tea are attributes you desire, then you must consume Yorkshire Gold. I have enjoyed this tea for many, many years, and recommend it highly.
1;Extremely disappointed;I was so excited when I had read about this tea and wanted to try it and saw it was sold here on Amazon. I quickly placed my order.
1;liquid Stevia - horrible taste!;No complains on the delivery time or a package, everything was fine. It's just the taste - it is horrible - so bitter and artificial! I can't imagine how people can like it and use it all the time, it changes the taste completely, like a drop of kerosine in coffee! Total waste of money.
5;The only flavor that doesn't irritate my stomach;Amazon offers great pricing on GU gels for runners.  I bought in bulk because I discovered that Chocolate is the only flavor that doesn't give me cramps or irritate my stomach.
5;fyi;"""They found that two of the licorice compounds, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were the most effective antibacterial substances. These substances killed two of the major bacteria responsible for dental cavities and two of the bacteria that promote gum disease."
1;Freeze drying doesn't work well with soybeans...;I really wanted to like these because I love edamame and I'm always looking for healthy snacks I can keep tucked away in my office (for afternoon 'munchy' emergencies)!  I bought this along with the 'Roasted Veggies' mix of which I will review separately because I had a much better experience with those.<br /><br />The flavor itself isn't bad but the freeze drying technique just doesn't translate well for these soybeans.
5;Banana Ketchup. It's not just tomatos anymore.;I have a story about banana ketchup. I was in St.
1;Good? You CAN'T be serious;To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos.
5;love it;Came right away. Tastes great.
5;I've eaten so many of these that I'm certain my bones are made out of them.;There really is no better mint.  Don't get fooled, though.
5;Great Way To Guzzle Tea!;I drink two large mugs of darjeeling tea with milk and sweetener a day. I've tried many brands, but I like Twinings best.
5;So much better than the 'mainstream' brand!;"I've been feeding these to my 10 month old as ""dessert"" for the past month or so, and he loves them.  I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray."
2;Blah Tea Blah Blah meh;It's okay.<br />It's doesn't suck.
5;I'm so disappointed!;I am so incredibly disappointed that this item (and many other formula items) is not directly available from Amazon anymore.  I was a regular customer for this product but can not afford the increase in price and also the shipping/handling that other companies charge, for the very same thing.
5;Can I just say Yum?;These are by far one of the most tasty chips available in the market. It's not greasy, doesn't leave a strong after taste as compared to other chips available in the market.
5;Instead of plain water;I work in a dry environment and drink water all day long. I have found many of the Nuun flavors to be very satisfying.
5;IT WORKS  FOR ME;I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all.
5;Great!!;I bought these at the store before and they were amazing. I tried to look online, but can't help but wonder.
5;Just too much heat...;I'm a big fan of hot sauce,but Raw Heat is just too much for my taste..
5;Love it!;This is the best granola I've ever tasted.  I think what I liked about these oat clusters the best is the fact that I was not hit with an overly sweet, overly processed fake food taste.
5;Great Natural Energy Product that Safe!;Excellent product to obtain natural energy in a safe manner.  I have tried every energy product out there and this one is my hands down favorite as you add it to a 16 ounce bottle of water.
1;Terrible Cereal;This is one of the worst tasting cereals I've ever had in my life. After eating this cereal I went online to see what other people thought.
5;Black Tea Refresh;I look forward to my Earl Grey tune-up twice daily. An important ritual in my life affords me a wonderful pick-me-up.
3;Just basic;These burgers were good.  Not great not horrible just basic.
1;Strawberry Jelly;Jelly did not set well and as a result is almost liquid. Taste is not that of Strawberry.
4;Good yerba-mate;Good yerba-mate.  Different quality for different people but it's good overall and at a good price.
3;Limited use, but it might be right for you.;Feral cats are the scourge of my inner city neighborhood.  They keep out down rats, but they have been using my carport as a Kitty Country Club.
5;Timothys Donut Shop;I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste.
5;big ol' bag of puffed quinoa!;This bag is HUGE! I bought it to use in a simple recipe (mix with peanut butter, refrigerate and then roll into balls and dip in dark chocolate..
5;cats love this product;The Weruva cat food, Mack and Jack from Amazon smells good enough for humans,  we envy our 2 cats their food! :D  The cats bury their little noses in the can and just love their food.  Thank you.
5;Tasty;Very delicious cookies, both  sweet and crunchy.  I got these for Christmas gifts to go along with tea.
4;Surprisingly nice drink for the season;"Now I'm a tea drinker and I will admit when I saw ""pumpkin flavored coffee drink"" I grabbed it up fully expecting to have my review set on `snark.' But having had it, I'm willing to eat humble pie, so long as there's a mug of this stuff with it."
3;Sweet stuff;Tasty with a bitter aftertaste. Too sweet and too many extra ingredients compared to another brand.
5;Pam's Bread Mix is a lifesaver;This mix allows me to make delicious bread, rolls, & pizza crust so I don't feel deprived.  I mix the dough in my bread machine & then bake it in the oven.
5;Highly recommend;My order was damaged during shipping, and they personally called me to correct the order and even threw me is a surprise:) I have never had better service anywhere..
4;Crumbly goodness;Perfect, healthy, world-conscious snack. The cookies can be a bit crumbly, but the taste overrides this fact.
5;Hill of Beans;Westbrae Natural's Organic Lentils are delicious and versatile. They're hearty in many dishes.
2;Falls short of a dark chocolate experience.;Looks like they didn't really taste test this product.  Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it.
5;Absolutely delicious coffee!;I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.
5;INSURANCE WILL PAY for hypoallergenic formula!!;Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician.
5;The Very Best;"I've tasted my share of ginger beers, including many from the Caribbean, but the oddly named (geographically speaking) Sioux City Ginger Beer is without a doubt the very best one.  I don't drink any other ""sugared"" soft drinks, and I dole these out sparingly, but when I want a special treat there's nothing else like it."
5;Wonderful product;Not sure why this item has received any bad reviews. These blueberries are just what I needed.
5;Ten Stars;Having multuple dogs to feed snacks to I can tell you this is their number one choice, hands down. Helping with hip relief is an added perk.
5;My Long Lost Love!;I've been searching for this cereal for years, because I love it so. I'm so glad to have found it on Amazon.
5;Wow! A different kind of energy;Let me preface this review with the fact that the Awaken isn't like other energy drinks I have tried. First, it isn't very sweet.
3;St. Dalfour's Three Beans with Sweet Corn;St. Dalfour's Three Beans with Sweet Corn was disappointing.
5;Great taste;I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.
4;Durable but not for hard floors!;I have a dog who can destroy almost anything he touches (everything but his kong and tire) and even he hasn't put a dent in this one a year later. When we had carpet I loved it, though I agree that the food dust makes a mess when it rolls around and gets everywhere.
5;Arrived sooner than promised in perfect condition;I was a little concerned by all the negative reviews but was desperate to find canned pumpkin at a reasonable price, the free shipping closed the deal. No dented cans at all.
4;Love the flavors that I can't find in stores!;My baby is not a picky eater. He loves all of the Earths Best baby foods we've tried.
5;Great product : easy to use + makes delicious purees in no time !;This is a GREAT product : not only does it make delicious purees, all vitamins preserved and so smooth thanks to the blender, but it also is soooo easy to use, not to mention to clean ! In only 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the ingredients) I can make amazingly tasty vegetables for my six months old, and just the right quantity so it is always extra fresh. You can also make more and freeze it in ice trays, I have to admit sometimes it is convenient.
1;Worst Valentine's Cards Ever;My eight year old son picked these out in January because he loves Star Wars. He was so excited to give them to his friends.
5;Healthy dog treats;Our dog would do ANYTHING for these treats! Have looked around at other brands..
5;Great Coffee!;I highly recommend this coffee, it is a very good blend, has a bold flavor without being bitter tasting.  Looking forward to trying some other blends Tully's.
2;I won't buy it again;The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.
3;Decent;This is pretty decent coffee. Not the best, but if you have acid problems it helps a lot! After drinking this, I had less acid burn in my esophagus.
4;This is what a really healthy snack bar is ....;I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts.
5;My Dog loves It!;My large dog is a very picky eater but when I mix just 1/3 of a can of Canidae Grain Free Formula with his dry food he eats all of it, every time.  He thinks it is delicious.
5;Delisious;A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
5;Best Cookie !;I got a pack of Byron Bay Chocolate cookie as a Christmas gift. It is the best cookie I ever had.
5;FRUGAL ALTERNATIVE;This is very delicious powdered milk, so much so, that it is difficult to distinguish from store-bought.<br /><br />Another very excellent aspect is that once made (use Glass Bottles!!  the milk will not sour even over time.
2;It's not the greatest;I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.
5;OMG Great!;I like both fresh and dried mango - I just like the flavor and taste and all good things about mango. I had tried other dried mango before, they were either too sweet (coated with sugar powder) or too expensive (my school store sells 4.
5;Works Great with Bread Machine;Used this flour with the Panasonic Bread Machine and Panasonic recipe for Multi-Grain Bread.  Recipe includes flour, 6 TBS added Grains (I use King Arthur Grains), Dry Milk, Molasses, Water, salt, and yeast.
5;Very good taste;I prefer the fresh New Mexican chile but these are very good - they have a firm texture and a great taste - I only regret that they do not can the really hot chiles.  I would recommend these chiles to anyone who loves or likes New Mexican or any NM type chile.
1;Tea is flavorless with small bloom;I purchased a glass teapot for my mother at Christmas and decided to buy this package of blooming teas for her as well.  I had previously purchased a single blooming tea at my upscale grocer and when I tried it I found it to be delicious and aromatic and the blossom was large and beautiful.
5;Great casings to work with;These casings weren't bad.  I generally buy from my local butcher but they were out, so these were what I bought.
5;Best Senseo Pod;I've tried most of the Senseo pods..
5;Eye Opener Coffee!;This is a stronger blend that has a great taste and will open your eyes in the morning without being bitter..
5;AWESOME!;I am addicted to peanut butter and could easily eat a whole jar. Of course I never do it and the only reason I don't is because of the zillion calories.
5;Best chili mix out there!;I've been using this product for years and love it.  Occasionally my store has run out of it and I've tried other products but none come close to this one.
5;My New Favorite Tea;I tend to prefer a more traditional tea over herbals.  Herbals generally taste okay, but just don't have the depth that I want from a good cup of tea.
2;Tastes vanishes within a minute (literally);I am not picky about chewing gums, I don't remember to have ever found one I did not like.<br />This one.
5;"The ""Green Pearl"" of Tea.";"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907)."
5;One of my favorites;I read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try. It's now one of my favorites and I will be ordering it again.
5;YUMMY!;Quite frankly, this is comparable to the Banana Nut Crunch from Post except this is better.  I look forward to the crunchy banana slices and the almonds that are hidden in this granola.
5;Delicious every time;I have made butter chicken from the Kitchens of India paste five times now (including for dinner last night). Each time, it has tasted a little different, but each time, it's been delicious! It is not too spicy, it just has a rich, delicious flavor.
5;GREAT TASTE, NOT SO GREAT PRICE;Cheaper at Target. $14.
5;A childhood favorite from Switzerland - so happy to find it on Amazon!;This seasoning salt is a mainstay on Swiss dinner tables. My father, being from Lausanne, always brought it home from trips abroad.
5;mm mm good;Love this salt.  It has a really nice flavor, not too salty, has a mineral taste that is very good.
5;Great Flavor Tea and Good Price;We first came across the Licorice flavored tea from Stash at a local Gourmet Market. The market has several locations locally but none close to home.
2;ghee;I ordered this.  This still has some moisture left .
3;Liked the Shampoo, Not much of a fan of the conditioner;I actually liked the companion shampoo but didn't get the same benefit from the conditioner and would be unlikely to purchase in the future. The companion shampoo left my hair feeling light with body.
5;Lance'a'licious;Lance products are what I crew up on. Whether I was buying from a convenient store or out of a candy machine.
5;Sue;I looked on Amazon for this product as I could not longer find it at my supermarket.  I use this when I make Mac and Cheese and find the product to be tasty and easy to use.
5;Pleasant Surprise;I was very doubtful when I bought these glasses but after trying them I am convinced they make a difference in taste and probably more so than, say, different shaped wine glasses.  I found familiar scotches revealing unknown flavors and aromas.
5;Fantastic product!;Orgain tastes great and is good for you. Glad to see Amazon finally having it on subscribe and save program.
5;"the best ""jerky"" product on the market";"this is the best ""jerky"" product on the market .."
5;Great Hair Product;This bottle was my second purchase of coconut oil for my natural 4c hair. It (coconut oil, in general) doesn't do much in the way of moisture for my hair, but it's a great sealant.
5;The best pectin there is!!!;My aunt & I swear by this stuff.  Nothing else comes close!  BUT it's getting harder & harder to find.
5;Balanced and refreshing;I first discovered this tea at my local coffeeshop, and I became enough of an addict that I had to order a 6-pack from Amazon. I find that the blend is just right for me - not too strong or weak.
1;Please Read Label;"I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted ""off"" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness)."
2;OKAY;Thia batter was okay. There are better recipes online and you can also mix in some of your own ingredeints.
5;Excelent Tea;I've used this tea for years off and on. It taste great for a detox type tea and I like to use it when I'm on a fast for a few days to help clean my body out.
5;Almost better than sex!!!!;I bought this soup for my husband who likes things hot and I mean hot hot..
5;Simply the best;I have been loyally making only this variety of brownie for several years but can no longer get the mix from local grocery stores, so I buy it here in bulk.  I always get compliments - I bring them to practically every function - and nobody can ever guess that they're low-fat.
3;My cat is a picky eater;"and she will evetually ""give in"" and eat this food, but she doesn't ""dive right in"" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food."
5;Love It;Cereals are generally one of the most expensive foods per ounce. Nutritionally they deliver less bang for the buck than most foods.
5;The Ultimate in Healthy Chocolate;Healthy chocolate is becoming a hot topic these days. Dark chocolate is being noted for its high anti-oxidant value, as well as other potential health benefits.
4;Versatile mix;I have started using this as a base for enchiladas (just add tortillas and chicken) and the kids and I love it. As a soup, well, we made it into a dip because it is a little thick for my taste.
2;Like Liquid Candy! Yum? Not so much.;My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Watermelon Strawberry is somewhat more desirable than Kiwi Berry.
2;Just OK;It's OK. Certainly not as good as what you'd get in a restaurant.
5;Wonderfully light and delicious cookie;I had these at a wedding shower and I couldn't keep my hands off of them.  The ginger and lemon mix together extremely well.
4;Lowery's microwave pork rinds;Great taste/flavor, medium spicy, crunchy, easy to prepare! Could be a little less expensive- approx cost is $1.00 per bag.
4;Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.;I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling.
5;So happy;Yayy!!! Not feeling well today and dreading having to go to grocery store. But the one thing I cannot do without is dog food.
4;Very Good, reminds me of Cayman;The Tortuga Caribbean Gold Bar Rum Cake is very good.  For some reason, it tastes better than the same version in the round cake form.
5;Best option for low sugar jam;Most pectins (Sure-Jell, etc) require as much or more sugar than fruit to gel- 8 cups crushed fruit and 10 cups white sugar does not inspire me to want to make jam!  But with Universal Pectin you can cut that as low as you like- I usually go around 8 cups fruit and 2 cups white sugar.  You can also use honey or other sweeteners.
5;great food;I got this food for my little one in all the flavors.  I have to say the chicken is her favorite.
5;Best Stuff out there;I LOVE Pamela's Baking mix.  I am able to make cookies, cakes and pancakes and my husband can not tell that it is gluten free.
5;By far the best decaf teabags;This is the only decaffeinated black tea available in the US that tastes like real tea. There is a reason this is the bestselling brand in the UK.
5;Good Iced Tea;We don't like plain iced tea but love Earl Grey Iced tea.  Love being able to order in large quantities since it takes several bags for each pitcher of tea.
4;Great nutrition! Good ... not great flavor.;A nice alternative flavor for this great green meal replacement. The vanilla chai flavor is missing the spicy chai goodness that would make this my favorite.
5;Love as snack or carb alternative;No fat, low sodium, low carb, some protein.  What more could you ask.
2;Doggie chow;Sorry but unlike some of the other flavors by Cesar, my dog won't go near it. I ended up giving it to a friend of mine for her less picky dog.
5;Delicious and fresh;The Roasted, Salted Pepitas were shipped quickly, sealed fresh and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this product for a snack or use them in your salad.
5;Let's put this in perspective;You will see other reviews criticizing this syrup as not being like Lyle's.  Different uses!!  Lyle's is excellent for baking and making desserts but not for beverages.
5;Best flavor for cats!;My cat loves this flavor of food!  (Beware of the salmon flavor, as my cat isn't picky, but absolutely detested that flavor.)  I was very impressed to find that Amazon carried this brand food and for a great price too.
1;Like thick, cloyingly sweet sugar syrup;When you order mu shu pork at Chinese restaurant, you get WONDERFUL DARK RICH VERY-PLUM tasting sauce with it.  However, THIS product is LIGHT, so sweet, sugary and syrupy that you can hardly even detect the plum flavoring.
5;Perfect Popcorn;I received the popcorn in a timely manner. The package was in perfect condition and the popcorn tasted great.
5;Better than That GalaxyMoney chain coffee;OK- I have to admit I was a huge SB fan (you know, that big StellarMoney coffee chain on every corner). I didn't expect much from a coffee ordered online, but I take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth, rich coffee.
1;I'm waiting??? In stock... but not send??? why???;I'm waiting??? In stock..
4;Pretty good;The price was great and the flavor is good. I only really drink flavored coffee.
5;Flavorful and Delicious;I found the Choice Organic Bancha Hojicha toasted Japanese green tea to be satisfying and nutty in flavor. I am not a coffee drinker, but for those who are and may enjoy a stronger tea, this is the one for you.
5;Great Tastinf American Popcorn;This is great popcorn and I too have the Whirly Pop. The 4oz packs work wonderfully.
1;Stale tasting;This tasted horribly. It was stale and bitter.
5;Great for Tapenade;"I just made some wonderful tapenade using these olives.  Can you say ""mouth party""?  They are also pretty tasty right out of the bag."
5;great product;Bariani Olive Oil is the purest Olive Oil I've found to date. It's cold extracted which allows all the enzymes to thrive and not be destroyed by heat.
5;A wonderful alternative when traveling;I was very pleasantly surprised by this product!  The salmon spread was extremely tasty, and I loved that it required no refrigeration and was completely portable.  It was delicious on the crackers.
2;not really a dark roast;I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.
4;tasty;These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.
5;The only cat treats they will purr for!!;I have two Bengal kittens, 5 months old, and cannot find a cat treat that one of them will eat. He turns his nose up at everything.
5;Oolong mango tea;Best tea ever, Oolong mango tea. I have enough for now, but I don't ever want to run out of this wonderful fragrant tea.
3;GREAT TASTE.;very sweet.  A few hours after eating these I am releasing methane like crazy.
5;This is great quality tea;I drank this tea after my first trimester of pregnancy for its numerous health benefits.  It is pure red raspberry leaves and great organic package.
4;K-Cup Switch to Coffee People Jet Fuel Proves OK;My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.
5;The BEST in Sugar-Free!!!;I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking when they write such horrible things about this amazing product.  It is not sour or bitter or anything of the sort
5;Delicious, naturally sweet;My wife is the coffee drinker in the family and was delighted when I surprised her with this product for her to test.  She hasn't stopped making yummy noises yet.
5;Definitely the FINAL answer (for now);I started with tabasco sauce at age 5, worked my way to jalapenos in my teens, then habaneros, and finally the ghost chili in my 20s. I am always on the hunt for the next HOTTEST sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff.
5;Love It!;The product is excellent and the price for a pack of 50 was outstanding!!!<br />When you drink as much coffee as I do, you need lots of back up! It was shipped in a matter of days and it was in perfect shape. Thank you Amazon.
3;great beans, get some but check shipping;ok, yeah, so, like, living here in the land of the pinto bean, I must admit, this is what I live on, along with guacamole for dinner, but these pinto beans have really taken over my digestive pipes and tank. This is where we grow them and this is where we eat them.
5;awesome,;After losing 30% of my hair due to thyroid and alopecia, I decided to purchase this after seeing it on Dr. Oz.
5;master of mixes;This is by far truly the MASTER OF MIXES you will not be sorry you purchased this item. It is the best to use when making pina colada's.
5;Great Pumpkin, but very poor quality control in dented cans;The pumpkin itself is great, but 6 of the 12 cans were shipped dented.  They had to have been sent in that condition because there was NO damage to either of the boxes in which the cans were contained.
3;Tasty but Expensive;This is a great flavored coffee nevertheless, K-cups are getting too expensive for everyday home use.  I am now using the filler and using my own ground coffee much of the time.
5;Sweet;This pineapple is so sweet.  And it's so convenient to have the individual serving sizes.
2;Ripped apart in less than 2 hours!;This toy should not be called Tuffy at all. My dog tore it apart in two hours.
5;Excellent daily tea;I started drinking tea in the afternoon about a year ago and this is the first brand and type of tea I've really enjoyed. Interesting and flavorful tea without being overpowering.
4;Amazing value for great coffee!;At less than $24 for a total of 48 oz of very tasty coffee, this comes out to less than 50 cents per oz (which is how much I use daily, roughly 2 large cups of pretty strong java).  If it weren't for this value, I'd probably keep buying at the grocery store (some of the better brands).
2;To much dietary salt.;I do like how these taste but there is too much dietary salt. I also found that after eating two, I began to get stomach knots.
5;The whole family loves these...;We love these, even my husband who has no allergies.  They aren't super sweet which I love, and the kids beg for them all the time.
4;great tea, but why does it cost so much more than other pyramid teas;Great tea.  Other Lipton teas with the pyramid bag are about $2.
5;Wonderful Chewy Healthy Treat;My yorky absolutely loves Greenies Chews.  They are good for him so I am very glad that he likes them so well.
5;Knorr Tamarind Soup;Received within expected date. Item as pictured/described.
5;Enjoyed;We have added this flavor to our Keurig collection and have come to enjoy it always. The contents have always arrived in the best condition.
5;mmm, mmm good!;"Hunt's Tomato Paste is always superior quality, with a great tomato flavor. We love it for making ""instant"" pizzas, mixing dried oregano, basil, and garlic with the paste plus a couple of tablespoons of e."
5;perfect food;This is a versatile food additive that goes well with so many items.  Use it in bread for a delightful, healthy crunch, or sprinkle it on cereal, outmeal and ricepudding to add a delectable nutty and slightly sweet tough to boring morning foods.
5;Low tracking litter;
3;definite mild energy boost.;The energy boost from this stuff is fair..
5;good soup;This was very good, added a bunch of beef and cooked for 6 hours, as directed. In some mixes, the beans don't cook down, but this has the right mix.
5;Excellent Snack for kids and adults;Love these snacks, my kids love the freeze dried fruits and veggies.  They are very convenient for travel.
4;Tasty but small packets;I bought these for my two year old son who eats plain oatmeal every morning for breakfast and he loves it!  They are fast and convenient to serve him.  But I usually end up making two packets for him each morning because each packet doesn't contain much oatmeal.
4;MMmmmmocha;I have to be honest, I was vary of trying a chocolate-coffee flavored green tea. I wasn't sure what to expect.
5;Chai means Tea;Introduced to Stash double Spice Chai in a gift box - we couldn't find it at our local stores. Fab fab fab! The spices are for the nose and the black tea base is stimulating, try it with soy milk for a very nice chai experiance.
5;Great taste with out hour drive to the store.;We use for our cleanse and instead of sugar. It taste as good as whole foods syrup with out me having to drive over an hour to get there.
4;good soy flour;I am currently experimenting with a lower carb higher protein bread. I have already learned not to use too much soy flour or that is all you will taste.
5;Miss Your Childhood Captain Crunch??!;My now-grown daughter used to love Captain Crunch-type cereal, and gluten-free seemed to be all about rice cereal which she hated.  Anything else was honey-sweetened.
5;Great Sweetener but learn about the product;I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.
4;Refreshing and just the right amount;I don't generally drink anything but water, coffee and tea, do not like soda, and only use juice in smoothies, so was surprised that I like the Switch juice drink as much as I do.  I've only tried two flavors, the Black Cherry, and the Kiwi Berry
5;the best olive around;I've become an oliveista and very particular.  Divina brand are delicious, hearty, meaty, buttery, packed with flavor and a special kick of jalapeno.
5;Amazingly good;I thought this was a silly way to spend money. I can put a tea bag of Twinings in my microwave in a cup of water.
5;the most consistently delicious nut bar available;Fresh, just sweet enough, appetite fulfilling and overall good for you. I use it between meals and before sports.
2;Why did they change it?;This used to be one of my favorite cereals--it had such a wonderful and unique flavor.  Now it just tastes too sweet like so many other cereals.
5;Great Green Onions;Good germination. great green onions.
5;Hands down, the best jerky I've EVER eaten!;While I discovered this product through Amazon, I purchased it through their website so that I'd be sure to receive a free sample (also saved 1 penny!). Sorry Amazon, I still love you! Amazon is a better deal if only ordering one or two of their products.
1;Worst Cocoa Ever;Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa. If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product, you don't have a human tongue.
5;great soup starter;A good price for what turns out to be a lot of great soup.  I use 1/3 to 1/2 of a pack, mixed with plenty of water and ample fresh vegetables to make great soup.
5;All Natural and Dogs Love them;We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.
3;I love the other 2 Folgers, This one is not for me.;The flavor of this reminds me of Gloria's Butter Toffee. The flavor of this coffee is good but it would benefit from a bolder bean.
5;Good value , good coffee;Good value and good coffee if you like the extra bold, like my husband does. His favorite is the Dark Magic and this replaces it at a fraction of the cost.
5;Breakfast Blend K-Cups;We're hooked. My wife and I have had our Keurig for a year now and absolutely love it!  The Breakfast Blend is a fairly mild delicious brew.
5;deliciously addicting!;i fell in love with these crackers at a winery in door county, wi. i bought a whole case.
3;Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7;I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day.
5;Superb Pasta!;*****<br /><br />Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder.
5;works wonders!;I've tried the pills to increase milk supply and they did nothing. This tea works though.
4;Delicous, but pricey;Maple syrup is delicous. This one is very good and high quality.
4;If only it were diet too!;With the new fad of making sodas that are good for you too, we have plenty to choose from in the drink isle. Switch's Orange Tangerine has a great taste, a fruity nose and is refreshing.
5;no need for sugar!;I always put insane amounts of sugar and cream in my tea, but this licorice spice tea has enough sweet that I don't have to add anything at all. Makes it easy being a college student and rushing out the door, i just grab a cup of hot water and throw the bag in.
4;Wonderful Flavor;These little goodies are so full of flavor and so good.  I bought these for my granddaughter in Minnesota and sent them to her.
2;Didn't like it.;Very artificial tasting.  Can't particularly taste chocolate or caramel, and definitely no coffee taste.
4;I wanted more peanut butter flavor...but not bad;These bars are nice and chewy and they're not too sweet, which I like. However, while the chocolate flavor was good, I could barely taste the peanut butter.
4;The bags not contain only 8.1 ounces;Like the chips
5;good;This salsa is yummy, but still not hot enough for my Dad..
1;YUCCCHHHHH!!!;Amazon doesn't accept returns of food items, so I'm using this product as dog treats. Very expensive dog treats.
5;Works well if you like cold coffee!;Im not a fan of hot coffee (even in the dead of winter), so this works perfectly for me!  It does blend it better with hot water so i usually use a little bit to mix it in and then fill it up with cold water.  I picked up the 50 pack for cheap before Christmas, but its kinda pricey otherwise.
1;cannoli shells;Product was fine, however ordered on 12/17 and did not receive product until after New Year's.  Very disappointed will not order again.
5;Chinese food at home;This seasoning is just like my favorite Chinese takeout dish: hot and spicy shrimp, which is usually served with a ton of chopped onion and hot rice. Delicious.
1;Very disappointed;The cans arrived all banged up.  I will never order from this company again.
5;YUMMY GUMMIES For Me!!;As like the other reviewer on this product, I to had searched high & low in my local retailers in MN, and I even contacted Wrigley about this problem to, they answered with a limited word reply on where i could find<br />some. well Amazon was at the top of the list.
2;After taste from nutraSweet Aspartame;I'm sorry to say even the non diet syrup uses nutrasweet as a sweetener, sadly this makes for a poor taste. I use the original Coke cola Syrup but now having trouble finding it.
3;Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea;***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas.
5;Coffee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;In my New York office I have 24 coffee trees, that's right you can buy them, I'm doing it for fun as I am not sure if I'll ever get coffee beans but in any event I love coffee and order it from all over the world, we even buy the green beans, roast it ourselves and so when finding this brand I thought I would try it, its fun, is good, and I've enjoyed it a great deal. Highly recommended.
5;My dog loves these healthy treats!;These treats are an excellent alternative to traditional fatty dog treats.  My dog, who is picky and will not even eat pig ears, loves them!  I highly recommend this product.
4;Dark roast, but not bold;The coffee is great, if you like a medium strength cup of coffee.  I do like the chocolate note at the end, but I'm not so sure you would taste it, if you were using a drip or even a French Press.
5;great low carb snack!!!;I have this item on the auto delivery & so far I had the nacho cheese which is pretty good and the Wisconsin Cheddar that I like very much. I just ordered the pizza flavor.
1;Fiber-None Bars  Don't Be Fooled!;Fiber one bars actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.
4;Best sour cream & onion chip I've had;"I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of ""brown"" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends."
5;What a treat!;Finding anything that is gluten free that the whole family can enjoy is reason enough to rejoice.  Soups have been a let down in the past because usually you want something just as quick as it is tasty.
5;Smells Yummy;These treats smell very good, I would eat them if made in jerky form for people! I would love them even more if they were sold in bigger bags, I have to order a few of these small bags at a time. We use them as training treats because they are moist but still hold their shape in my pocket.
3;Not bad for a vegan gluten free bar;With a consistency like a Little Debbie Brownie and a taste like the no-Pudge brownies, these will not be for everyone. However, if you are on a restricted diet (no soy, no gluten, no dairy), these bars fit the bill.
4;Tastes like More!;"My late father in law used to have a rating system for meals: if it was particularly tasty, he'd say ""This tastes like more!"" That's exactly how I felt the first time I tried a spicy picante ramyun. I ordered these on a whim when they were featured as a gold box deal."
5;NorCal Grandma;"This decaf pod has wonderful flavor.  It is much better than their previous decaf ""Skip the Buzz""."
3;ITS GOOD BUT THEY JACKED THEIR PRICE WAY UP;I LOVE THIS SALMON IN CAN. VERY DELICIUOS AND GOOD FOR YOU.
1;Filled with Bones;While I applaud Tiki Cat for using Dolphin safe sources, as well as being high protein, no filler food, I cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />Almost every can containing Salmon and/or Tuna has massive pinbones left in.
5;Newman's own that you can trust;Regardless if your dogs likes tractor oil better or not, Newman's Own is a label you can trust. Fortunately, my dogs do love it.
1;Bad Quality;I bought the product and several flavor extracts from their actual website.  I don't want anyone else to have to go through the same frustrations for lack of information.
5;Bought as a gift;I bought this as a Christmas gift and the receiver told me that he loved it. He loves the tea and the wood chest it came in.
5;THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! Ended years of IBS-C suffering;I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C.
3;I wasn't impressed, but my child liked these bars;Nutritionally, I thought these bars were fine. 140 calories, 3 grams fat, 4 grams fiber, 9 grams sugar.
5;Good stuff;I decided to try this tea because I am a big fan of the Traditional Medicines Throat Coat tea. Echinacea Plus tastes good and is good for your immune system.
2;pecan pie;Honestly, if you want an excellent pecan pie,find a decent recipe, make your own dough, put fresh ingredients in it, and make it yourself.  Otherwise, the dough is going to taste stale and the filling, mediocre.
1;dont buy from this company;I would NOT buy from this company again. when the pro treats came they were already expired by over two months.
5;the best;I got a free sample in the mail. The caramel latte was so good I loved it, I just added a little bit of my caramel coffee creamer cause it needed a little sweetess.
5;Outstanding;Having owned a coffee (retail) business for 14 years, I found the Altura Organic San Francisco blend to be one of the best packaged blends I've ever tasted.  Rich deep flavor showing that this company understands.
4;I like them.;they look nothing like the picture on the package. they're pale, not brown, nor do they have indented creases or what have you.
4;Awesome -- silky smooth!;My sweet daughter had already rejected the Namaste Cookie Mix because of the plastic flavor and gritty-ness. I made some brownies for my sweet from this mix, and she LOVED THEM! My son and I ate some warm, but we froze the rest in little squares.
1;Terrible!;I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.
5;So Much Better than Lemon flavorings from the grocery store;When my next door neighbor moved she left a bottle (about 3 tbs. in it) so I tried using it in a couple recipes that called for lemon oil.
5;stash peach tea;This tea is hard to find so I bought 6 boxes. When you open the packet, the bag smells exactly like fresh peaches.
5;Great for busy families;I have 3 children under the age of 8 and work fulltime, so we are always on the go.  The Happymorning product line has helped us immensely, not just in the mornings, but for afternoon snacks as well.
5;Great product (All natural AND Gluten free);This is a great product.  It's all natural (no preservatives) and it's gluten free.
1;Frevilous;The most dishonest company.The ingredients on line is different than on the bottle.
5;Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian Decaffeinated Medium;My husband bought me my Keurig coffee brewer for Christmas last year, along with a variety box of K-Cups.  We sampled each and decided that the Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian Decaffeinated Medium was our favorite.
2;Sweet & Spicy: Natural & Artificial Flavor;For years I have been enjoying Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy (natural flavor) tea but the last box had a different flavor, which I don't like. I wasn't aware that it was actually a different formula that has artificial flavor added.
5;Perfect treat for your pet;As with the chicken flavor, my dog absolutely loves these treats. He's turned into a quick learner knowing what reward awaits for him.
5;The best product for the price;"After reading the book ""Deadly Feasts"" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul.."
5;Great variety, great tea!;My boyfriend bought me this tea as part of a birthday gift and I must admit, I was a little intimidated at first! There are so many different kinds of teas in this particular variety pack, many of which I'd never heard of. It's important not to over-brew the tea and to use the right amount with water, but it isn't difficult to adjust the amounts depending on personal preference.
5;fabulous, really.;"i don't drink coffee, but love tea, and these are wonderful to add to a nice, warm, steamy cuppa.  just a hint of flavor and no ""off"" taste, nothing chemical or metallic."
5;Delicious Spiced Tea (Chai);Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.
4;it was an acquired taste;I  first bought this as a subscription, so it wasn't TERRIBLY expensive. I found the first box to be unpleasant: it tasted thin and acrid.
5;MMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW...;These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.
5;Natural Temptations;I bought this All Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor Treats for Cats by accident thinking they were treats for dogs  But, my MinPin, Bandit, thinks their the greatest treat in the world.  I can get him to do anything for a few of these!! He would probably even stand up and dance.
2;they taste like styrofoam;I'm not sure why everyone is so crazy about these. My kid will hardly touch them, and i can't blame him.
5;MsJBird;If you haven't had a Wickles you have got to try them.  My whole family goes crazy over Wickles, I ordered them through Amazon at a higher price than what I can get them for in Iuka, MS.
5;Hardly any different than dark chocolate variety;Crunchy-crisp at the same time chewy. For most food that's a sin.
5;Keeps me in my Mother-in-law's good graces.;My Mother-in-law simply loves these candies.  She is on her fourth tub since Christmas.
5;Delicious, this makes a meal!;I've bought this product many times in the supermarket. The Amazon price is much better than what I have ever paid for the same item.
5;Simply the best.;Anyone who has spent any time in Italy will tell you this is authentic Italian espresso. Not only is it authentic, it is delicious.
5;Cookies to love;"Living without gluten for over 15 years has meant living without a lot of ""normal treats"".  However, these cookies are not giving up ANYTHING."
1;obscene price;You can get this for less than $5 at Costco in Pennsylvania. The price listed here is unfathomable.
1;is the price correct?;am i reading this right?  one bag is $7?  it's $1.99 a chinese markets.
5;Great product, great price, baby loves it and ORGANIC;I started using Erth's best after I had my son now for over a year.  I was given Similac Sensitive in the hospital but I noticed that my baby had lots of gas.
3;Not the best;With so many choices now, I thought I woudl give this a try.<br />The Donut shop Decaf is by far my favorite and this one falls short.
3;mixed reaction;Bought this tea because the brand my husband and I love - (lipton bavarian wild berry) was sold out on amazon..
4;Disappointing at first, Better after a few tries;"I enjoy eating healthful foods.  It makes me feel better when I make ""healthy"" food choices."
5;delicious!!!;this is a great product!!! i LOVE mojitos, but they are hard to come by since fresh mint isnt a usual item to stock at bars, homes, etc.  bottled mixes will do, but i cant help but notice they dont taste homemade.
5;Good Coffee!;We generally don't buy K-Cups for our Keurig but, we decided to try these out. It is extremely easy to make, just brew it over ice.
5;Absoultely addictive;I would like to second this 'german' review, this candy is really great. And I'm sorry to see that it's so much more cheaper in US than in Croatia.
1;Ick;There's nothing good about this cereal.  It's just a bunch of crunchy puffed rice tossed in with some flakes.
5;LOVE;We've been making Miso soup at home for a few months now and this helps it taste very good. Not all salt and lots of flavor.
5;Strong Coffee;This flavor coffee is the only one I can find that is strong enough to handle the large mug size without getting weak.  It took forever to be shipped, though.
4;Variety Pack;Im not sure if everyone receives the same variety but I got the following: Corn Meal, Whole Wheat Flour, Unbleached Wheat Flour and Whole Wheat Pastry Flour. Was hoping for a wider ranged variety (like rye perhaps) but Im still pleased.
3;Worked on leg cramps, no effect on sleep;Since starting this powder about 6 weeks ago, I haven't noticed any effect on my sleep, but the number of times I have been woken up by leg cramps (a.k.
4;Smells great - strong aftertaste, but not horrible;Gnu Bars is on to something good, but they need to keep on working a little.<br />This one has a really great fragrance when you open the package.
4;Great product.;this is a great product,it helps to relieve my bloating.I will order it again.
1;YUCK!!! Buy another variety!!!;Tastes like pine needles!!! I've had other earl greys before and never have I thought I was drinking pine needle tea (Another reviewer said it was a bergomot flavor, i'm not educated enough to know)..
5;Best oolong tea ever;I love this tea, it is awesome. I actually was sick and the only tea I had in my house was green and oolong tea.
3;Good product if eaten quickly.;This is a Good product if eaten quickly. the taste was excellent.
5;Calculations Aside...;To clear up the calculation issue..
1;Walden Farms Thick and Spicy BBQ Sauce, Sugar Free, Calorie Free, Fat Free, Carb Free, 12 oz.;Unfortunately I do not have much to say the product never made it to me. And I never got a refund so I am out the money and I have no clue what it taste like.
5;I'd like to buy the world a Coke, and keep it company...;Coca Cola has always been popular
5;Our PUPS LOVE this canned food!!;Another great product from Diamond Brand dog foods. Our pups absolutely love this food.
5;Fabulous Chocolate Coconut Water;This coconut water bought from Amazon is fabulous. It is refreshing with a real chocolate flavor.
3;50/50 not for me;I found that I need the caffeine and that the 50/50 half decaf was not as good as the regular 8 O'Clock coffee. So I think I will stick with the regular for now.
5;SOOOOO GOOD!;Delicate in texture and just the right amount of orange peel and raisins to complement the dough. Generous in size.
5;Anita;These are the best bars made by Larabar.  They really taste like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and they are not as sweet as the other bars.
3;Like Battery Acid;(This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal.
4;They sure are pretty;I bought these because my daughter asked for a sparkly cake for her birthday.  The sparkles themselves don't taste good, but when they are on the cake they take on the flavor of the frosting.
5;More than I thought!;I bought this for my son since it is his favorite candy.  Since I received more than I thought I would, I set some aside to give to him as a surprise next time he is home from college.
5;O B-ROTHER;I PURCHASED A 3 PACK FOR EASTER<br />MY MOTHER IN LAW<br />A BRITTLE FAN<br />WENT CRAZY<br />NO..
5;Flower bouquet;I hesitated in ordering these. I was wrong these were great.
5;Tastes Great With Limes;Eden Organic Kukicha tea is organic. This tea is low in caffeine that's great for kids,pregnant women,and those with high blood pressure.
4;Great for camping;Really nice for bringining camping.  If you are looking for hot dogs for grilling, however, try the frozen Morningstar Veggie Dog product -- for our taste, Big Franks are much better at room temperature.
5;VERY TASTY ON A COLD WINTER'S NIGHT;EASY TO MAKE AND THE TASTE IS JUST GREAT. LOVE IT.
5;Great coffee!;I bought this coffee for my mom and dad - both of whom drink a lot of coffee and love gourmet flavors.  My dad took a sip of this coffee and swore that we had poured real almaretto into the coffee.
5;Kitty loves this stuff;My cat cannot get enough of this product.  She sits at the pantry and meows at the container!  The can in larger and full, but the product is flaky so it doesnt last long.
4;Tasty, a little bit runny;Great product.  For my older daughter, I made all organic baby food homemade.
4;Not Too Bad;We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it.
1;Are they kidding??;You can pick up a 2-pack of these Arrowhead 2.5 Gallon waters for $4.
5;CHOCOLATE ZICO;Just tried the new chocolate Zico..
3;Funky packs, mediocre taste;First- taste:  Bold-ish. I didn't get that full body taste that I expect from a bold brew.
5;Pb2 is good for you, tastes good 2;I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to enhance  all their blender protein drinks & shakes.  I was amazed how good it tastes.
5;My new favorite baby food!!;Our baby was ready for a little supplementation to breastfeeding, so we've tried the Sprout line-Stage 1 for a week now, 6 different flavors, & I love it!  Every one of the foods tastes delicious (I would happily eat it myself), & my 4 1/2-month old son has gobbled up every one.  They are a thicker consistency, which I find to be a plus - it's easier for my son to swallow & not spit any out with each bite.
5;yummy;This is very good hot chocolate, creamy and tasty.  All of the flavors are good, my favorite is the peppermint.
5;Wow!;This is the third flavor of this brand we tried and it, like the other two, have been a huge hit with our cat. We follow a primarily raw food diet for him and sometimes get cans as a treat (or if we get a little lazy).
1;Misleading discription-bad taste;They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle.
5;Yumlicious!!!!!!!!!  :);This is one of the best teas I've ever had! I am not really much of a tea drinker, but I enjoy iced tea much better than hot tea. My former workplace has China Mist Passion Fruit Iced tea as their staple drink for customers, and I became obsessed with it! It has a wonderful flavor, yet not overwhelming either.
5;Great Coffee (from a non-coffee drinker)!;I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).
1;Tastless, weak, not sweet, do not buy;I was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good.  I brewed it on small setting and big, very weak, not of quality.
4;HImalayan Salt - 5 lb - Fine Ground;Great deal for the quality of this Himalayan Salt!  I will be purchasing more and giving it as gifts.  This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet, in moderation.
5;Your cats will love it.;My cats really love these treats. They come running every time I grab the bag.
1;Stale Chips;Item came promptly however the crisps were 3 months past their freshness date. Was told I would get replacements.
5;Yes Yes Yes Thanks for Healthy Snacks Like This One;"These ""chips"" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one."
5;yummy and healthy treats;My dogs have a sensitive stomach, so I've got to be careful about what I give them. These treats are perfect.
5;Best Moscato I ever tasted!;I drank this to celebrate my engagement and upcoming wedding!  It was the smoothest Moscato I have ever had.  I like my wine sweet, and this pulled it off without overpowering you with sweetness.
5;so glad you carry it!;Our local market used to carry this product, but then they closed.  I was sooooo happy to see it on Amazon.
5;Best pistachios around;I purchased these pistachios as a present for my husband.  he loves Turkish pistachios and we can't get them here in rural Maine.
3;its ok;The taste is OK. ive only tried it once and then it went in my pantry and it has been sitting there.
4;Good product no instructions;Luckily I have made bona before because these pearls come with no instructions. also be warned they are not the quick cook variety they take the full time.
4;One of the boxes I received had only 17 bars in it, not 24;I placed an order for multiple boxes of this item.  When I opened the first box, I immediately noticed the bars were all jumbled up, with obvious voids in the box.
5;Natural Treats;
4;Touch of honey spices up these whole grain wheat crackers;If you are looking for whole grain wheat flour healthy graham crackers to add to your diet, then consider checking these out. The touch of honey gives them a subtle sweetness that makes them tasty enough to eat without complaining about eating cardboard :) This is a health food item, so if you are expecting it to taste like sugary fatty cookies, you will be disappointed.
5;Kids love these!;My son is allergic to peanuts, so finding a tasty product that is safe for him to eat is wonderful!  I love Enjoy Life foods.  Amazon has a wonderful price on their products.
5;T-Disc Carousel;This is the best way to store your T-Discs. I have been using it for about a year and it works great.
3;Great;We got this to replace one we had already had.  It was great to recieve it so fast and I will look forward to buying more.
1;nearly expired product;Like another reviewer, I too received a box of nearly expired product.  If you will consume this within a month of ordering it is a good deal, otherwise buy it elsewhere.
4;No-guilt beans;Tasty & a great S&S price with no additives=score for tacos & quinoa. Couldn't pass up the price, though I'm not sure how Eden compares to others cost-wise normally.
5;Excellent Taste!;This is a great alternative to hot dogs.  They have a pleasant taste and the kids love them.
5;"Great healthy convenient ""fast food""!";"We use this and others in the line of Eden ""rice and beans"" for making quick dinners which are actually healthy. Although it is a meal in itself, i usually first brown ground chicken or saute shrimp and then mix with the beans and chick peas."
5;Super Deal;Would pay 4 times more at the store for something similar.  This is an amazing deal.
3;VERY Strong... but feels good on sore throat;"I looked at the other reviews for this drink, noticed that many said the ginger was way strong. I thought ""Well, I really like ginger, so it'll be ok."
5;My dogs have clean teeth;My dogs get their Greenies at noon, can hardly wait to gnaw on them, and and then chew heartly until the Greenies disappear.  The good news is that all my dogs now have clean teeth.
5;Wonderful!!!!;I began using this product four weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I have thrown out or given away all the other products I used.
5;Excellent noodles;These noodles have a wonderful taste and are thicker than most of the other kind.  They make great caseroles and are good in any kind of cooking.
5;Dee-lish!;Lentils would win the Miss Congeniality title in any legume pageant.  Even the lowly brown grocery store variety is tasty in soups, salads and on their own, but Lentils du Puy are the Holy Grail of lentils, grown in rocky French soil and very expensive in the US.
5;ate the whole thing myself;a coworker brought in the 42oz canister and over the next week, we enjoyed them.  i had eaten these before, but didn't realize they came in a giant tin like this.
5;The best corn chips out there;Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.
5;A deer and racoon repellant for your garden that works.;We've used Deer-Off for several seasons in our garden in a rural area of southern Wisconsin.  It really does prevent deer from sampling our garden and keeps racoons from digging up newly planted plants.
4;Worked great at first;Worked great at first.  After we put out the second trap with a fresh lure, many fewer moths were caught (even though we still had quite a few) and we often saw moths sitting near the trap, but not going in for the bait.
1;Gross!;This flavor is terrible.  I was expecting a sweet-salty combo similar to kettle corn.
3;Product not as described;Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.
4;Easy, fast, excellent!;I have been a Keurig owner for 5 years, but just recently became interested in Hot Cocoa after giving up coffee.  My order arrived yesterday, and last night my son and I tried it.
5;When nothing else works, these do the trick;Our 10 month old daughter loves these peach snacks.  They are basically freeze dried yogurt which melts in your (or your little ones) mouth.
5;Wow!;This is the greeen tea to drink! It doesn't have the bitter after taste that some of the other green teas have and tastes very smooth. I have been drinking 3-4 cups a day for the past couple of weeks and it tastes wonderful either hot or iced.
5;Excellent Lobster Meat;I have tried one other brand of canned whole lobster and really found the Bar Harbor brand the very best.  I also decided to regularly order two cans monthly using Amazon's subscription service.
5;Love these!;Not all flavors are equal, so choose carefully to find one that matches your taste buds.  I, personally, love the cherry pie.
4;smooth and creamy drinks!;This is what can turn your blended drinks from slushies (mostly ice) to smooth, creamy and delicious! A friend who owned a coffee shop sold me some of this and it makes all the difference. I was just on the Ghirardelli website and they have an extensive list of drinks - coffee and non - to make using this product.
5;Greenies for dogs;Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.
2;Different Texture?;I received my honey today (bought many from this seller), but the texture was different this time around.  It was more white than brown and it was very crystalized?  I think this was a bad batch.
5;Excellent tea, and fast shipping;This is terrific tea. I bought it to make iced tea, and it's got a smooth, lovely flavor to it.
5;Great orange soda without being too sweet;Our family, wife, 2 year old and 4 year old, have had other Switch sodas in the past, and liked them quite a bit. They had a bit  of an apple flavor overrode the main That's definitely not true for the Orange & Tangerine.
5;Really is Extra Virgin Olive Oil;I bought this olive oil because of the testing done by University California Davis in early 2010.  The results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples, and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples.
4;Great Product - Too Expensive!;I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.
2;NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for;My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc.
4;My wrinkle puppies love them!;They stink, who cares. They're dog treats and the dogs looove them.
5;Have been using this AMAZING product for over 25 years.;My husband and I are senior citizens. We want to add our testimony to all the thousands of other's around the world.
5;great criollo nibs;I love these nibs. the price is affordable for organic and this is real criollo, the best cacao! i have tried other types of cacao nibs but criollo tastes much better.
5;Progresso Italian Wedding soup;Fast shipment and packaged well. Love this soup.
5;DELICIOUS and well-sized.;"These nut bars truly taste great, and the ""30% bigger"" size is just the right size for me for a snack.  They also strike the perfect balance between chewy and crunchy -- there's no gooey-ness, and they aren't too sticky."
5;Perfect for Marshmallows!;"I have been using the marshmallow and the cotton candy flavored oils to use in marshmallows for quite some time and I love every flavor I have ever used. People always ask, ""How did you get them to taste just like it."
3;Didn't taste above and beyond much cheaper brands;I will not buy again because this simply was not worth 16 dollars!  Tasted no different from grocery store brands.  Disappointed.
5;FAVORITE HOT COCOA!;"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good."
5;gluten free thin crust pizza shells;The price is right! Amazon got them to my home in an extremely fast shipment. The gluten free pizza crusts were thin and excellent.
5;Very good;They where good. Took a long time to get here from the UK.
5;Haribo Gummy Bears Rock!;My husband and I love Haribo gummy bears.  We have been buying the 3-lb bags at Walmart but this was a better and more economic solution for us.
5;rhodiola tea;When I first tried this tea I found it to taste delicious and drank it black. I gave this tea along with The  Rhodiola Revolution book as Christmas gifts.
5;Back to Nature Peanut Butter  Creme Cookies;The cookies have a great flavor.  Love the texture of the filling.
5;Wow!;I had never bought cardamom before and wanted to investigate before buying any, since it is expensive. I learned that the powdered version loses its strength quickly.
5;Crackers great tasting, shipping not;The crackers were something that we got in FL and ordered when we got home.  The crackers are great tasting, but the shipping allowed them to break up and now we have small pieces of crackers.
5;Not a ringer for Nabisco!;"I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too ""blah."
2;Can't find the perfect Creme' Brûl&eacute;
5;Good snacks;Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.
2;Didn't really work;I usually hit a wall right around 2:00 in the afternoon at work. I start yawning and my eyes get heavy.
5;A Tasty Alternative to the 100% Columbian;With only one exception I'm a serious fan of Eight O'Clock coffee. I usually maintain a supply of the 100% Columbian and the French Vanilla coffees on hand at all times.
5;Taste Great!;These cheese balls are hard to find..
5;Very good!;Bought a couple packages at a local store, and then bought a whole case here on amazon.com!  That should tell you I like it!  It is very good alone, but I imagine adding shrimp will make it even better.
5;Hands down my favorite tea!;"I've been ""addicted"" to this tea for years and glad that it has become more widely available.<br /><br />A few weeks ago my cousin and I were discussing our love of tea."
5;Fabulous as always!;I frequently purchase flowers from Falcoln Farms and have never been disappointed.  My most recent order was shipped quickly, and the roses were beautiful.
5;Great Taste;I love the KIND bars.  They taste great and are much healthier than other bars.
2;Not for human consumption;I had high expectations for this product considering the other reviews, but I cannot choke these things down. Not trying to down talk these things, but I just can't eat them.
5;YUMMY right out of the BAG (Dark Chocolate & Red Berries)!!;I am a huge fan of granola and have tried many brands.  I especially like to add granola to my Chobani Greek Yogurt.
5;thirst quenching;i love the pineapple the best. had a hard time finding this at the store,they get ya hooked and then stop carring it.
1;Forget the lime!;I love lime.  I keep some in my frig most of the time.
1;Tasteless, arrived badly damaged, and long past the expiration date!;I love figs and took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to order these. I was quite disappointed when the first box has 1 dented can packed in with other products, but I opened it anyway.
1;They changed the recipe! No longer tasty;They used to be my favorite cracker but always so expensive could barely afford and also because they used to be so tasty I'd eat the whole package in one sitting. But today I splurged on a package and unfortunately they changed the recipe and they tasted bad.
5;Wonderful bread;I served this bread and my guests raved about it.  The crust is nice and crunchy, and it is soft and moist on the inside.
4;The Step Between the Bags & Captain Picard's Way;I've tried this tea by the bag and it does tend to be milder than your average supermarket Tetley or Lipton. But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer.
5;My Cat Dances for these treats;I buy chicken livers for my cat. She has now learned to speak English persuasively in order to get these treats.
5;Sardines;I am one of those fishermen who like sardines with crackers.  I had read that sardines from the coast of Portugal are among the best, so I gave these a try.
4;More fizz for you POP!;I love this drink! It tastes yummy! it has a festive and intimate feel, although I found it a bit hard on my stomach. Other than that
5;Fun bites, happy dog;Upon receiving the treats, I gave one to the dog.  She loved it.
5;Works great;Product works great fleas get trapped and cant get loose .They have put an end to my flea problem but keep a few papers on hand just in case needed .
4;Good bird;"My husband wanted to cook a duck in my new oven.  I was ""disinclined to acquiese"" to that request (semi-quote from Pirates of the Caribbean), because he practically burnt up the previous oven with the same sort of venture."
5;Love Big Hunks;I'm extremely pleased with my Big Hunk order.  This is the second time I have bought them online.
5;Lamby delicious;Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them.  I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors.
2;It wasn't terrible!;I would not recomed this product. We used the first can.
5;Amazing how much the size of the bite impacts its appeal!;My Shih Tzu, Missy, had pretty bad tummy problems (vet says food allergies) for the first two years after I adopted her in 2008.  Then I discovered Natural Balance products.
5;Taste Great!;I can't say if it gives sustained energy as I just had my first pack.  I will say they were crisp and tasted great!  I'm always looking for portable energy food that is NOT low calorie.
5;Addicted;Food of the gods, assuming the gods like their food hot as hell.  I used to get this amazing stuff at Safeway and all of a sudden they stopped carrying it.
5;Great Soup;I am now officially addicted to this. Definitely not the stuff your mom made for you from a can when you were a kid.
5;Pamela's Baking Mix;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;Not bad;I often use the pouches of food and I thought this would be so great!  My only complaint is that the hole is all the way at the top of the spoon so the food pools up there.  You have to shake it to move it down or overload the spoon.
5;Delicious and nutritious snack for kids or adults...;These are packed with flavor and with vitamins.  I recommend them as a healthy snack for kids or adults.
5;good things do come in small packages;The 6 hour power energy shot does just what it says.  A lot of times I only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that I look for.
5;perfect treat for dogs with allergies;Although only one of my dogs has allergies, I give these to all of them.  Despite the fact that they have berries in them, I have not noticed any stains on my carpet.
5;Excellent Product!;This paste was not a disappointment! Yummy artichoke flavor came out strong. Made some Bruscetta with it and on the crusty, toasted french bread with garlic and mozzarella cheese it was divine.
5;The best ever;My children and I adore this PB. I actually hate honey but the bee's knees has just a hint of it and is just a bit sweeter than regular pb.
5;This one works!;"We went on the Dukan diet and began using Stevia.  We ""muscle test"" most of the products we eat, and this is the only one that seems to give a positive muscle test."
5;Great Stuff!;I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon.
4;4 experiments, 4 different tastes;I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning.
4;Good taste, filling, healthy;While I usually eat granola bars for a quick snack, they're not especially good for you nutritionally.<br /><br />I decided to try something different and went with the Fruition Strawberry bar.
5;safe treat for poms;SmartBones Dental Dog Chews are the perfect treat for my two pomeranians and one Pembroke Corgi. No rawhide, nothing to upset their sensitive stomachs.
5;Superb Malaysian Curry;I almost thought that I'd made this myself as it was so good!  That such flavor came not from my chopping up galanga, lime leaf, turmeric, etc., all of which are part of my pantry, but from a pouch, well, I was really impressed.
5;Just what we wanted;I never write reviews.  Ever.
5;Lowrey's Microwave pork rinds, hard to find at the stores;Microwave pork rinds. Hard to find at the store, made easy on Amazon.
5;Fabulous product - Improvement over Hamburger Helper!;In our house, I've been barred from EVER buying Hamburger Helper.  I suppose that's what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly!  So, when I mentioned that we were going to try this, the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet.
5;Just fantastic;"I ordered the 5 hour energy drink,<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Ugh!;Maybe I got a bad batch, but this stuff was terrible.  It did not taste like Illy coffee, and I've had a lot of good Illy coffee.
1;Bad stuff;"This pie filling is ""filling"" but tastes terrible.  The cherries are tough, so they may have been picked ""green"", but with all the added ""enhancers"", no one could even tell they are eating ""cherry"" pie."
5;Worth the Wait;I always wondered why Prego never came out with a vodka sauce
1;BUYER BEWARE;I purchased this item along with all of the accessories for my daughter (new grandson) for Christmas. It came up in conversation and my daughter said she had read reviews about the unit growing mold in the center.
1;Awful;"Like other reviewers, I bought this tea because the box clearly states ""Formerly Indian Spiced Chai"". It is absolutely disgusting."
1;Shipped half the order !;I ordered two different flavors of ZippFizz.  The company accepted payment for both but only included one in the box.
5;AMAZING;I sampled this oil at Murray's Cheese shop in NYC and immediately bought a bottle. As I was nearing the end of the bottle, I panicked.
5;Superb;These are superb. Light sweetness, deliocious nut flavor.
4;"Ok, Kind of ""chemical' Tasting";The bottle is very large and you'll get a lot out of it.  Intensity of flavor is to 'taste' - I think that's why they measure by 'a squeeze' rather than anything more scientific (also, for convenience).
5;Fifties;These candies bring back great memories from my childhood. The product is beautifully packaged.
5;good eatin;Twisted fruit is to sweet for my taste, but my kids love it.  I can pop it in thier lunchbox and feel good about it!  Plus they can open the package with ease.
5;Perfect.;After searching high and low for energy shots that give you both healthy ingredients and are easy on your stomach for morning use, I stumbled across this product and  it is exactly what I was looking for. There is nothing in these shots that are harmful for the body and I can take it just about any time of day without suffering the normal consequences of an energy shot like sore stomach or jitters.
5;Healty and Delicious;This is a great product if you are looking for something that is low-cal, low-salt and tastes great. It's basically rice and dried vegetables and does not contain any added salt.
5;Firm stool;Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool.
5;Surprisingly good;I am eating a lot of protein on my current diet - no, eating plan - and these make a great high protein snack. I'm glad they're available in serving- sized bags or I'd be tempted to eat way too many of them.
5;tasty japanese style noodle;both my husband and myself love this noodle! Really tasty and especially good in cold & wet weather. You can adjust the amount of power soup base to put in if it's a bit salty.
2;Spoiled upon arrival...not good;The seeds looked and smelled perfectly fine at first when they were whole seeds, but as soon as i ground them, i realized they were spoiled. They instantly had a sour smell to them once ground, almost like spoiled milk.
4;Nice product;Nice product, but with the food bag it is a little difficult to control.  I have a very active 7 month old that won't hold still and it seems a spoon and baby food jar work better for now.
5;Pop Chips;I absolutely love Pop Chips.  They give me the crunch and flavor that I want and I don't have to feel guilty when I eat them!  Perfect portion size in the single serve bag.
5;Easy, quick and consistantly delicious brownies every time!;Trader Joe's has been carrying the No Pudge Brownie mixes for over a decade and it's not unusual to see customers buying them by the case.  At the current price of $15.
5;Cat's coat has never been softer!;After searching for a grain free cat food that made our cat happy, we discovered Now!. He loves it and it has made his coat super soft.
5;Good Cuban Coffee;I have a 15 year old daughter who lives in Ohio and when she visited us here in Florida she tried my Cuban coffee and liked it. I purchased a manual espresso machine and this coffee for her and also ordered some coffee for me.
5;Tullys House Blend;I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill.
4;Kitty Crack;"The Monster just loves it, he literally licks the bowl clean.  It's real meat, no ""parts"" or junk nor does it have any grain."
5;Great Decongestant!;Working great for allergies and when 3 year old got a cold.  Decongested in about 2 days.
2;turn soft early;I am no longer a fan of these cashews, after having cashews. The brand seems to turn soft early on, not holding their freshness.
5;Love, Love Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Black Tea K-Cups;I can not express how much I looove the Celestial Seasoning English Breakfast Tea K-Cups!!!  When I purchased my Keurig, I was drinking Bigelow's English Breafast tea bags which I opened and used in the My K-Cup.  I had a rebate deal that sent me 2 boxes of the Celestial Seasoning tea K-Cups and I've been hooked ever since!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings is much smoother than the Bigelow.
4;Extra Ginger Flavored;Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps are loaded with ginger.  Both candied and ground ginger give these small hard cookies a real kick.
5;Better than restaurant;just got back from Budapest to Prague tour, with a tube of the Gulash Cream + sweet paprika cream.  Made my first batch - so yummy, so much more delicious than what we had in restaurant last night in Prague.
5;Extremely Pleased;I got these as a gift for my birthday a year ago, being a total gummibear fanatic. When I got these gummibears, I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I felt how soft they were.
5;HORRAY  !;Finally Altoids made a most tempting Altoids flavor of liquorice !  I have tried almost all varieties & since liquorice candy is my favorite I tried this and loved it.  Its especially strong  ( which is great ) and since the mints are white as all of Altoids falvors are
1;Taste like old socks;I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
5;My favorite seasoning...;Like most reviewers here, I love this product! Why did Costco stop carrying it!! I tend to go their website ([..
5;Delicious, healthful, and well-priced!;I love stretch island fruit bars!  Our local Costco started carrying these a few years ago, for about the same price found on amazon. I quickly became attached to these delicious and healthful treats, and was very disappointed when Costco stopped carrying them.
2;Overpriced;Two and a half times the price for comparable product at warehouse store and no perceivable difference in quality. Also, no shaker top for a product that needs one.
4;My kid loves these;My 15M old loves Plum Organics. The Pear & Mango is especially tasty.
5;Tastes like a cookie;Gave the vanilla cookie to my husband who is a diabetic. He has been missing the sweet baked goods he used to be able to eat.
4;Hawthorne Berries;Received in good condition and in a timely manner.  Great for relaxing the heart.
5;I like this;This is not a bad product.  If you're careful & make it exactly as described, it's pretty good, better than the blue box, not quite as good as homemade but is quicker.
5;Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied;"Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People ""extra-bold trilogy""--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger."
1;Ordered twice, moldy both times!;When my first set of bones arrived covered in thick, hairy, green mold, I just sent them back and asked for a replacement. I thought that it might just be a one time thing.
5;Halva Heaven;This luscious goodie is very hard to find..
5;Great Flour;It works great in bread, cakes, and other things that I have baked.  I will also use this in making meat substitute.
4;Tasty and lots of good ingredients, but very SWEET;I usually eat Kashi granola and was interested to try this product.  I noticed on the label that it has much less sodium than my usual Kashi but about the same amount of sugars (6 g) and half the fat.
5;works!;Been ordering this food before, my cats eating, vet says it works, results on the bloodwork good, so it is working.Took a few weeks for cats to ajust to new food, but seems everything ok now.
4;Butter Toffee K-cups;ordering another pack of 50. Smells wonderful when brewing and has a nice flavor not too strong.
4;It's a Decently Pleasant Tea...;"Well, first off I should say that I'm not new to tea.  I'm not sure I'd describe myself as a ""tea connoisseur"" but I'm pretty experienced with tea."
4;health benefits;This tea helps for constipation, I have nerve damage and I rather take a natural<br />product over precription drugs! I had a hard time getting this at first. I take two cups of water to one tea bag a day.
5;Great product!;As another reviewer said, these are pulverized in our house.  Once the can is opened, somehow that aroma waifs through the air on the back of a gnat and they're by my side in 1/2 a millisecond! My only suggestion is that if you have a cat that doesn't like pates, be careful on these grilled varieties.
5;Best GF Basic Bread Mix;We've tried a lot of the other brands and flavors, and this is really the best we've found so far.  My gluten-eating husband loves it too.
5;I adore this tea at bedtime!;After reading other reviews, I ordered this tea warily along with the Davidson's Honeybush tea, in case I needed to tone it down a bit. I was pleased with the price for organic tea.
4;You'll either love them or hate them;There's no true middle ground as far as these go. I've passed these around to others and have found that you either adore this new flavor or it's something that you just want to avoid like the plague.
5;the best salad dressing EVER!;my mom bought this from HEB central market in San Antonio based on a rec from a friend and this is hands-down the BEST salad dressing you can buy (or at least that I have found).  It isn't too salty or overwhelming like a lot of other dressings, and it has the perfect combination of sour, sweet, garlic, salt, and savory.
5;Wholesome Sweeteners;This is the best alternative to sugar I have found so far.  Not only is it organic without the usual chemicals other products have, but it tastes good.
4;Great flavor;I received the sampler box and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoy all the flavors. Not too strong not too weak.
4;Favorite Gu Gel Flavor;Although I haven't ordered this product through Amazon, Vanilla Bean is my favorite flavor of the Gu Gels. I've tried several other Gu flavors, and I like this one the best.
5;Just What You'd Expect;A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.
2;Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie;The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon).
5;Healthy Oat Bran;This is a really good source for healthy oat bran.  It can be used in muffins, other recipes and the Dukan Diet.
5;How to stop the leaking!;After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self-fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place. The secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and NOT snap the lid over the edge of the filter.
5;Wow, does my grandma work for you?;Growing up in the southwest refried beans were a staple in our home and anytime we went to my grandmothers house we were always excited to eat a bean burrito on fresh made flour tortillas. Her refried beans were very special with a smooth texture and rich flavor.
1;Terrible;I thought these were a good bargain but these particular models are really bad. I've used fart bags before and these don't small at ALL! They are really weak.
5;Great tasting baby food;This actually tastes really good.  All my kids (ages 6,5 and 22 months) love these.
5;Excellent Source of Fiber, Protein and Iron;This grain has a delicious nutty taste and it is easy to create a nutritious meal by boiling it and then adding stir fried veggies, I like it with asparagus. I also found it at Costco and was very dissapointed when I discovered they no longer carried it.
5;Excellent moth trap!;We have unfortunately had a real problem with these food moths and found that these Pantry Pest Traps to be EXCELLENT in catching them. I truly do not understand the negative reviews, other than perhaps these customers do not have 'food' moths but 'clothes' moths.
5;Good balanced Green Tea;This is a good green tea. It is balanced and doesn't have that often grassy taste that green teas tend to have.
5;Tasty tuna;I usually buy the G'Day Gourmet Tuna, but decided to buy this because the price was so much lower.  The tuna is nice and there are very large chunks.
2;Melted;Seemed like a good deal, I saw some other reviews mentioning melted candy. I was hoping the cooler weather would prevent this, but the bag of candy I received was definitely melted.
5;Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food;When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.
5;Happy to find on Amazon;We can't purchase this product in South Florida.  My husband has loved this product for the last 30 years.
5;temple of heaven gunpowder tea;Exactly like another respondent, I bought this tea on a whim while browsing through a Chinese supermarket, thinking that the name and beautiful product packaging would make for good coffeetable conversation. However, it is the best green tea I've ever had, except possibly for Orchestral (which I can't get anywhere), and it's perfect with a little honey or sugar.
5;Green Mountain Dark and Extra Bold Dark Magic;both work very well in a Keurig brewing system.<br />i noticed a few others had mentioned the smooth<br />taste strong taste for this blend.
5;Labrada Protien drink;this is very good! I've used GNC products in the past, but I like this one because they have more and different flavors and it leaves me much more full than the GNC stuff. I will buy this from now on.
4;When they work...they are great!;I've had years of experience pilling my various cats. I always swore by a combination pill gun and fill-em-yourself #3 gelcaps.
5;Fresh, smooth and rich;Excellent decaf that can go toe-to-toe with some caffeinated coffees. Rich tasting with no bitterness.
5;Like Triscuits but healthier;We have bought a lot of Kashi Heart to Heart crackers since DH had a heart attack last year, but we've never tried the originals. I didn't realize it, but these are the woven wheat type of cracker like Triscuits, not crackers like the other ones we've been buying.
5;Tasty Treats for the Pooch;My dog likes this food.  Its high quality and not full of by-products.
5;great hot;great speed on delivery. Got exactly what i had ordered and was very happy with everything about this transaction.
5;A little pricey but what a great portable treat!;I love these pouches.  It is just grab and go
5;Fantastic Tea!;We own a hair salon and have served this tea for almost 3 years now and our clients come in and request it.  It has been a huge hit.
5;Good stuff;I decided to try this tea because I am a big fan of the Traditional Medicines Throat Coat tea. Echinacea Plus tastes good and is good for your immune system.
1;It's different than the ones from stores;The idea is great. Save trips to the store and is cheaper than the stores but when I opened the bag, it smelled funny and color is much lighter than the ones that I bought from the stores.
3;So so...;Not bad, but there are better gums than this one. At the beginning is a big explosion of flavor and sugar like sensation, but after 5 minutes is gone.
5;Quick Shipping--Great Product;I was very impressed with how quickly my vanilla beans came.  I was thrilled because I was anxious to get started on making my homemade vanilla.
5;Easy;Easy to prepare and tastes good.  Definitely to much salt but not unexpected.
4;"Very creative! (but ""caramel"" isn't the best name for it)";What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling).
4;tasty, not sure about how much tuna is good for cats;Our cat is enthusiastic about the taste of these fish-flavored Petite Cuisine meals. (I'll try to post a video review also.
5;I love this stuff;This stuff is so delicious, I love it.  I've already ordered a second round of them.
4;delicious spicy corn soup;Very good soup.  Easy to make and brings Latin American flavors to life.
5;Dogs love this product;My cocker is having liver issues and has to take a lot of prescriptions. I was using cheese around her pills but she caught onto that quick and wouldn't eat the cheese or the pills.
3;Meals were hit or miss;I bought these soon after trying a gluten free diet. I should note I'm really not picky, I will eat almost anything.
2;Meh...;NOTE:  This product probably works best if you are going to put them in a thermos, but it doesn't work that well if just placed in a coffee cup.<br /><br />I purchased these back when it was a kickstarter campaign.
3;Great product, VERY EXPENSIVE Amazon Price;The product gets 5 stars..
3;Sorry, no cafe revolution for us.  Marketing letdown.;My husband was thrilled when this arrived-- he'd been intending to buy some to try.  However, we were both less than impressed.
2;Disappointed that they changed the product;I have been buying Green Mountain Dark Magic for a long time..
1;what happened? the recipe has changed;For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.
3;Way too sweet..;These were on sale recently and we decided to try them out.  They are chewy but not so soft that they break off when you grab them out of container.
5;Delicious Tea;I love this tea. It is delicious.
5;Dog crack.;Dogs love treats.  All I can say is the look in their eyes has changed from one of excitement and food gratification to addiction.
4;Recommended Tea for small cups;The tea meets my expectatons for Twinnings.  The flavor was full and smooth.
5;Good, healthy breakfast or snack.;I love that this has a fair amount of protein and the only sugar source is directly from the fruit.  I also love that it has a VERY short ingredient list.
3;OK but I think there has to be something better...;I've made 2 pizzas out of this brand and maybe gluten free doughs are all like this (I'm new at this) but the dough was REALLY runny so I had to improvise and add other GF flours to it.  It was REALLY had to get the shaped dough onto the pizza stone! But once it was cooked up with the toppings and sauce, it wasn't that bad hot / warm but was horrid cold.
5;Great deal, great beans, fast & free shipping - Thanks!! Love it, love it!!;This is my second vanilla bean purchase from RJ Mushrooms.  The beans are amazing AND a great value - if you've ever purchased quality beans, you know what I'm talking about.
4;Tastes good;Arrived room temperature..
5;Butterscotch pudding;"I grew up with puddings that you had to cook.  ""Instant"" had not been invented, yet."
4;Best K-cup cocoa;I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had.
5;delicious;This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.
4;Okay;My puppy finished the edible bone in a couple days. But unfortunately she also ate half the non-edible brown plastic bone !!!!<br /><br />Tha only bone she still has (2 months) is the whilte bone.
5;Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.;By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup.
5;The best cashews I've ever ate!;I was lucky enough to receive five bags of yumnuts for free and sadly we ate them all already! These are truly the best nuts I have ever had. They seem barely roasted--enough to enhance the flavor, but the color of the nuts is still really close to the color of raw cashews.
5;Pure and Delicious Iced Tea;My wife and I have been using unsweetened iced tea for years.  It's great if you're watching your sugar, however it is rather difficult to find an instant iced tea that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives.
5;Taste great;This is the best brand for vegan jerky. I love all flavors of Primal Strips, and Thai Peanut and Lime are my favorite.
4;Pretty Tasty!;I jumped at the chance to try these peanut bars because I'd tried and really liked the Planters Big Nut Triple Nut bars last month, and I was hoping I'd like these Double Peanut bars just as much.  Although they are good, they aren't as good as the Triple Nut bars.
5;Decaf Sugar Free Coffee;I have had this on my wish list for a very long time and apparently it has not been available.  I just assume it will never become available.
3;Funny name, plain old coffee;Picked up a case of this just because the name made me laugh.  Nothing special about the brew.
1;worst crushed tomatoes I've ever used;Just made some bolognese sauce with two cans.  Everything tasted wonderful until I added the crushed tomatoes.
5;IMO, perfect.;I drink my coffee with a splash of half-and-half.  Other hazelnut k-cups are too bland for me.
5;Calm Plus Calcium;I LOVE this product.  I would do without food before I would do without this.
5;Terrrrific!!;Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews.
1;added fish oil to this for a BABY??;I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.
4;yummy in pink;I've been making food for my 7.5 month daugher.
5;A healthy addiction;Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.
3;Not great but they are OK;If you can get these at Amazon Warehouse at a good price AND you are someone who can use this many croutons..
4;tasty, but very salty;I am a salty snack person, but this is over the top salty.  The chip is flavorful, and it is not greasy (just as you would expect).
1;VERY UNHAPPY;THE DESCRIPTION ON THE PRODUCT WAS 24/1.5 OZ BAGS.
5;great for dogs with allergies;My pug has bad allergies. After trying alot of different food we finnally found Pinnacle duck and potato.
1;Country of origin is news to me;These packages contain less than the ones I have bought at CostCo for several years and cost more, by the time you figure S/H.  Our store no longer carries them so I was happy to find them on Amazon.
5;Rich, Dark and Delicious!!;Love this Coffee!  If you like a strong, dark, rich tasting cup of coffee this coffee is for you.  Another plus is that this coffee is easy on the stomach (not too acidic).
5;This food is a godsend!;This was the fourth brand I tried due to my female shorthair cat's frequent vomiting without any sign of hairballs.  She started out with original Cat Chow, then I tried Eukanuba hairball formula, and eventually Science Diet sensitive stomach formula, which was by far the most problematic, causing her to throw up at least once daily.
5;Not just for candy making;Oh this is so good! I've bought this and other dry flavoring so I can use them to flavor coffee, tea, and even water. And not pay the high prices of already flavored products.
5;Great taste, great price;I started looking online for a milk alternative since I'm in college, need breakfast, and don't want to pay $4.50 for a half gallon of milk.
1;Horrible Coffee, heed the negative reviews;I should have paid attention to the negative reviews for this coffee, but I decided to give this coffee a try anyhow hoping to find an easy online supplier for coffee.  The coffee is tasteless.
5;You'll never go back to the instant stuff;I am positively lukewarm toward oatmeal the way it is usually prepared: the prepackaged freeze-dried hyper-processed powder steeped for 30 seconds in hot water.  This stuff is different.
5;Mestemacher Three Grain Black Bread;Thanks to Amazon I am able to purchase on a regular automatic shipment this excellent bread from Mestemacher, their bakery goods I already knew from Germany. This bread brings me the exact taste back when living in Europe.
4;tasty;I used this as a pasta sauce and it was pretty good.  I would not buy it regularly because it is a bit pricey, but it made a quick and easy birthday lunch for my little (45 year old) brother.
5;The fussiest cat on earth loves this!;My 9 year old cat, Lupita, has always been a problem eater.  She'll lap at food, and walk away.
5;Sweet treat, that is not too bad for you.;I buy these often, and I get a pretty good deal from amazon compared to getting it in the stores.  I keep some in my desk at work, gym bag, and ocket book for when a hunger attack comes on.
5;One of the best candy bars ever made!;I live in a small town, so we don't get this candy bar.  Went to Sam's in Salina,Ks.
5;great product, great service;i have been using fenugreek as a galactagogue for over almost two years now, and it works incredibly well.  this is an excellent price for the product, and i have had great success working with the company.
5;I like them much more than regular pretzels;My son's celiac so we buy these pretzels by the case.  I was never a big fan of pretzels but I eat these all the time.
5;best beef jerky i've ever had;"We bought the 2.5 oz ""original"" recipe package for $3."
5;Four Paws Up!!;Fast delivery.  This is the second bag of the rawhide,ring chews we have purchased.
5;Vet recommended, Cat approved!;I adopted two very undernurished kittens from the Humane Society, whose on-staff vet said that AvoDerm dry and canned food is the best on the market for cats. When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens.
2;SICK TO THE STOMACH;DOCTOR OZ said this was good stuff and would quell stomach aches containing gas. Well I ate a small handful as he said to do, and an hour later I retched  and double over from stomach pains and developed rectal bleeding.
4;Cooking it in a programmable Rice Cooker makes for an easier breakfast!;"I never had much patience for Steel Cut Oats, until I read about someone using a rice cooker to make it.<br /><br />How easy could that be?  I have an old 3 cup ""fuzzy logic"" type Rice Cooker, and using ""Porridge"" mode works best."
5;My cats love it!;I have 5 cats and one is especially spoiled, even for a housecat. This is what he actually cries for when I'm out.
5;No need for sugar;With these flavorings there is no need for me to add sugar.  I just add some of whatever flavor I am in the mood for.
3;Sickly Sweet, but Better Diluted;Many many moons ago, I was a big Crystal Light fan, back when all they had were lemonade and pink lemonade in the little tubs that made a whole pitcher.  They've expanded their product line over the years, but they lost me way back then, though I can't recall any reason other than general apathy.
5;Best pesto sauce in a package mix!;We love this pesto sauce mix and it's hard to find at our local grocery store so I get it from Amazon.  This is the only pesto mix that my kids like!!  They've eaten it since they were small and now they want it at college :-)  No spinach in this one (Knorr's has that) so it's a simple basil product.
5;Most expensive bread ever, but so worth it!;I had this bread a long time ago, and I couldn't find it anywhere near me, so alas I had to order it here. Good shipping times, and MaxBras even sent me some candy for ordering! So very nice of them.
5;Coffee flavoring;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Atomic!  WOW!!;This is the best we have ever tried.  We have ordered twice now.
5;Delicious Water with just a HINT of flavor;I am bad about drinking my daily water but this stuff certainly helps.  The flavor is just right - not artificial at all like so many flavored waters and enough to taste like more than plain water.
5;The whole family loves these...Yum!!;"There aren't many things that my whole family agrees on but we all agree that these Cookies & Cream Pop-Tarts are awesome.  My husband always refers to these as the ""Oreo"" Pop-Tarts."
5;rjrich43;purchased from this site due to past experience with Green Mountain coffee. It is great coffee a great deal will buy certainly buy again when I need more coffee.
1;not sealed correctly;This is first time Ive gotten K cups that are made so cheap that the GLUE holding the top onto the k cup comes losse from the steam of the machine, and makes coffee grounds pour out and into my coffee and all over my machine.  I Bought 50 Of these and I Cant return them, and I Cant find anywhere to contact the seller , because the seller is AMAZON itself.
5;Yum! Best Deal Per Oz and Good Customer Service!;If you've ever had Tapatio, obviously you'd know it's wonderful.  My boyfriend and I use it so much that it was getting kind of pricey to buy those small bottles at grocery stores for like $4 for a couple ounces!  So, we bought it in bulk!  This was the best deal out there that I could find, even with the shipping included.
5;Love This Stuff;I am allergic to chocolate, sad I know.  So when I found this it was great.
5;Formidable;This has been my favorite mustard for the past 20 years. There simply is nothing like this product.
4;My dog loves this!;My dog loves this food and it makes me feel good that he is eating right.  He was like a dog in a commercial eating it for the first time.
1;Tastes nasty;I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor.
4;Great price on this nice spice mix;Durkee Garden Seasoning is impossible to find locally, so I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.<br /><br />My vegetarian husband loves this mix, which has a nice blend of onion, herb and spicy dried peppers.
5;Doggie Love;My Maltese absolutely LOVES anything that Exclusively Pets makes. But if you really want to train your pet, give him or her a cheese treat! The greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says.
3;Not what I expected;I love pistachios. After reading all the superlative reviews I was expecting a wonderful taste treat.
1;Causes nausea;I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract. Unfortunately, every time I take it, I get very nauseous.
3;This Is NOT muscle milk;typed in muscle milk in the search bar and this popped up, with a pic of a muscle milk can. It got to my house and the can was not as it was in the pic.
3;Delicious, Highly Spiced Noodle Bowl, Still High in Sodium;One bowl (2 servings) makes a filling lunch for one.  The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.
5;Open Pit Barbecue Sauce;I love this barbecue sauce more than any other.  It is very popular in the midwest and no where in the west can you find this sauce.
4;like the item not happy with the service;The white tea rub for lamb adds a very nice flavor to our lamb meals.<br /><br />However I ordered 3, 5 oz cans of lamb rub and only recieved 1 with 2 other cans of chicken rub in the package.
5;Love my Beaba Babycook;I love the ease and effeciency of the babycook! It steams and purees in just two steps and it is all contained into one machine. My only wish is that the container was bigger! I have twin boys and so we go through a lot of baby food.
5;Yeah!!! We have eggs for backpacking!!!;Finally!!!!! I love eggs, but don't like to carry them backpacking for obvious reasons
5;excellent coffee..the best price;love my Keurig coffee maker..
4;Amazing product;This product is phenomenal. I don't even drink coffee/espresso and longer.
5;Hazelnut kit kats are outrageous!;Hazelnut kit kats are outrageous! They were imported from Europe but so worth the wait! They taste like Nutella. Definitely worth trying out if you never have before.
5;Amazing;My brother brought this stuff back from South Korea for me a year ago and have been unable to find it since. This stuff is the nectar of the gods, if you are a tea lover, it has such a sweet taste that lingers in your mouth for a few minutes after your last sip.
5;Worth the price;I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop.
5;need a real seltzer bottle;After living in New York most of my life (50 years)my wife and I moved to Maine, there are only three things from N.Y.
5;1st class product;Could have never had made a better and more beautiful cookie!!!! The people who received these as gifts were so impressed and i was proud to say they came from [..
5;Best flavor of tea around;I can only find this flavor of tea in specialty stores from October through March, and only when they have it in stock.  I think other people like the flavor too.
4;Delicious!;My cats love these. They're mostly just freeze-dried fish, which speaks to their quality.
4;Great but not best to eat all the time;I've always loved this cereal but when I've tried to keep corn syrup out of my diet (because things just taste better without it!) this is on the list of things to avoid for that reason.<br /><br />This cereal is GREAT in milk, you get chocolate milk to finish off in the bowl, also the cereal is fairly filling if you just needed a quick bowl, if you are looking for a full meals worth of eating, you may find yourself finishing these boxes in about 5 bowls like myself.
5;Is good enough for my Italian family, good enough for me;as early as i can remember when going to italy, everyone i would visit would be cooking on the stove a pot of Lavazza Creme e Gusto.<br /><br />I was tickled to see that i could start getting this through amazon's subscribe & save.
5;excellent taste without a whole lot of extra calories;I really believe this product lives up to its manufacturer's claims: tasty, sweet, chocolaty, but sans all the extra fat and calories. The nuts were roasted with cocoa powder, which is indeed an excellent idea! In fact, I like the idea so much I'm planning to experiment with this method in my own cooking.
5;My favorite Stash tea;I love this tea.  I have bought many, many flavors of Stash tea and this one is by far my favorite.
5;My Dogs Love Them!;One of my dogs has inflammatory bowel disease. This is one of the few products I can give her for a treat that she can eat because it's low in protein and in fat.
5;You don't need extra fiber with this one!;This soup has excellent flavor and is easy to fix.  I replace 1 cup of water with low sodium chicken broth for richer flavor.
5;MY DOG LOVES THESE;Found these Health Bars with Apples and Yogurt at our WEGMANS.<br />My dog loves these treats.
5;Larabar, how I love you!;I have been on a journey to shed weight and have lost over 100 pounds. I got all the junk food out of my diet and turned to natural whole foods like lean meat, nuts, fruits, and lots of veggies.
4;a tip for improving consistency;I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein.
5;Awesome Pop and not Misleading;The pop is awesome and in the old fashion style painted glass bottles it makes it a special treat.<br /><br />In response to the first review.
5;Excellent Product and Excellent Service!;This company is fantastic! I bought these sausages as a Christmas gift for a family member. The shipping company damaged my order in transit, and Burgers' Smokehouse had a replacement package to me before the end of my delivery date estimate.
5;very good low acid coffee;I used to hate coffee but this one is easy on the stomach and doesn't have that tar after taste that so many others do. Its a good coffee for in the morning and irish creme creamer goes great with it.
5;Love this Candy!;When I recieved it, I couldn't believe the amount of candy I purchased for the reasonable price. Very yummy.
3;I've had better;I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy.
5;Favorite Green Tea;This is my favorite green tea to share with friends.  The aroma when adding the hot water and while the ta is brewing is delightful, and just a prelude to the wonderful flavor of this tea.
5;yumm;This is a great product. I made it with a recipe from Rick Bayless Mexico One Plate at a Time cooking show.
5;Good deal, good stuff;The stores around where we live do not carry this brand. My Wife said its better than the others.
3;Indistinct. Not Up To Hype On Label.;I've been trying out a few blended red California wines which I find at a nearby Fresh and Easy Store and a few of them have been exceptional bargains. They're totally unpretentious wines, of course, but some have been exceptionally good values, in my opinion.
1;bad product;I have purchased this product from local stores and have purchase the fries from amazon.  These chips that were delivered are rancid.
5;Good Life Catnip Treat;My picky one year old cat loves this.She will not eat any of the expensive wet food,only Friskies dry.
5;These are addictive;Maybe buying the big bucket wasn't the right move? These bad boys are addictive. I was never an almond fan until a co-worker turned me on to these.
5;My Cat Adores This Food!;Only food my cat will touch! She loves this stuff forever :) I feel like it's quality as well. I'm very happy with this product.
4;Good stuff;Kids love the syrup but you can get it at Bed Bath & Beyond for $2.99.
5;Tastefully Done!;Dark chocolate masterfully prepared with that lingering chili sensation that makes this a dream choice for those that love dark chocolate with a little kick to it.  The chocolate playfully teases the senses to wanting more.
5;Complete & Working;We ordered these for our father for fathers day. He loves these candies.
5;Great bed for small dogs;This bed came in a sage green color-perfect for the house.  The dog feels secure - it also works great in the car.
5;Best Balsamic vinegar around;If you really like Balsamic vinegar I mean really really like it tlhan Fini Italian Balsamic is for you!  The two pack keeps one unopended until you need to use it!  You can use this one on strawberries or salad.  The taste is wonderful and I use it sparingly on lots of different things.
5;Soooo good!;"I received this product through my Influenster Mom VoxBox. My son immediately ate it up and said to me it was ""the best he had ever had""."
5;Jerky Cannon;WOW this jerky cannon is really NICE I mean super NICE. for many years I've been using the Nesco jerky works jerky maker yes the red & white cheap piece of plastic thingy LOL.
5;The best and most Hard to find Drink on the market.;This is by far the greatest energy drink ever made. Perfect balance between flavor, energy boost and price.
1;disappointing;Package full of alot of very small broken pieces and tiny chips, not whole slices as shown. Dogs were not very interested in them.
4;good product, but some QA problems;This  product has great potential because it allows the user to create their own coffee at a reasonable price. It is new and there are problems with the glue ring that are being worked on.
4;Great flavor;The hazelnut coffee is great.  Definitely recommend it as I plan to do the periodic delivery of this product through Amazon's grocery section.
4;I don't have a taste for it but maybe you will;I don't have a Keurig coffeemaker which I think this product is made for.  However I was able to simply cut the bags open and put them in my normal coffeemaker filter and make coffee that way.
5;Our cats love this stuff!;Well, we finally found a treat without byproducts and corn products<br />that our cats both like!<br /><br />We've tried all the flavors now. This is their second favorite one.
5;Honest to goodness  yummy shrimp chips;I'm eating these shrimp chips right now and I thought, I should share this info on my Facebook (so I actually need a photo of this can of shrimp chips and that's why I looked it up on here). No image!  haha.
5;Love These!;Good Quality and Tasty Nori delivered to your door. I use these instead of lettuce for wraps and of course sushi.
5;MY FAVORITE HOT CEREAL;MUCH TO MY DISMAY WHOLE FOODS NO LONGER CARRIES OLD WESSEX FIVE GRAIN CEREAL. I USUALLY STOCK UP ON IT WHEN I GO TO THE STORE.
5;Love this Item!;"I love this product and think it's delicious, not a fake flavor either, a nice vanilla flavor which is hard to find in ""flavored"" coffee.  The price however is WAY over priced, I purchased it offline for $3."
4;NUTTY N' NICE;Green tea by itself is nice, but adding brown rice gives the green tea a smoother after taste. It adds a nice nutty flavor that compliments sometimes bitter taste of green tea.
5;I'm Addicted;My husband and I eat popcorn most nights.  Popcorn was on the core food list at Weight Watchers.
1;Chocolatey;"Anything that contains fake crap like this chocolatey junk doesn't get my vote. It's so bad they can't call it chocolate legally so they call it ""chocolatey""."
3;Smoky Bacon;This bacon was really good and smoky.  It was not great, though.
4;Good Quality Product;I bought this for my young son who wanted to try peanut brittle.  I looked at my local stores for peanut brittle, but could not find any.
5;Love this peel;This is an awesome product.  It is very gentle, but it tingles so you know it's working.
5;Great magnesium!;I buy empty 00 capsules and make my own. The pre-made capsules I buy at the store are too large for my kids to swallow.
5;More for Less;I bought this product because my daughter had a hard time with all the other formulas except Enfamil Gentlease.  I had to quit breastfeeding due to some medicine I was taking and did not want to pay $50.
5;Its so hot!!!;If you want something really spicy on your food..
4;It helps during breastfeeding;Helped my wife during breastfeeding time.This product along with better dietary habits , helped her especially when her milk was going down.
5;Excellent Product!;I transitioned my little Shih Tzu over to FirstMate puppy food.  She is doing really well on it and she poops less.
5;ZICO - Great stuff - a bit expensive!;ZICO Coconut Water is great stuff.  I wish I could find it somewhere where it wasnt soo expensvie.
4;Braggs/ broken bottles;I love the product but both times I have ordered it, one bottle gets broken ruining the labels on 4-5 others that are in the same plastic with it.<br />Since I am re-selling, that is a problem.
5;Fabulous dog toy!;"I have two adopted greyhounds, and they both love this toy, whether with or without the rawhide rings.  One of them is a very tough chewer, and she's destroyed a lot of toys that have been labeled as ""indestructable"" or ""for tough chewers."
3;Not as tasty as other Larabars;I had tried the cashew nut Larabar and loved it. Then tried some of the fruit ones.
5;EXCELLENT FOOD;EXCELLENT FOOD , GREAT VALUE, MY DOG LOVES IT AND IS GOOD FOR DOGS WITH ALLERGIES.  I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.
5;NICE MILD FLAVOR!;Triple Leaf Tea, Blood Pressure, 20 count. I've got this tea for my Dad to help him with his blood pressure, it is a little early to tell.
5;Sooo yummy!;I actually bought a small bag of these last year from a grocery store. I fell in love with this candy! It looks scary enough and still TASTES AMAZING! I was so excited to find this on amazon and at such a good deal! The bag I bought last year had only 20 pieces or so and was a little pricey, but I bought it to go with my themed Halloween party.
5;Great tasting and easy to use;This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea.
5;Stevia;I have purchased Stevia from a different company and for about the same price.  Problem is, it had a plastic taste to it.
5;helped increase my milk supply;I found that this tea really helped increase my milk supply. It tasted a little funny at first, but I quickly got used to it.
5;best way to get my kid his veggies!;maybe this is just coincidence but since starting to regularly drink the wild berry amazing supergrass for kids, our 8 year old has slowly started to develop a taste for vegetables.  a couple of years ago he would only eat fruit but refused any veggies--particularly the green leafy kind that are so good for you.
5;You'd never notice it's sugar-free;Well made brittle, without any strange after-taste.  It's made with a natural non-digestible sugar substitute, not chemicals.
5;She eats it with the medication added;I have to give my cat medication twice per week, my cat's pretty feral, and I'm not terribly adept at pilling a cat.<br /><br />So, pills ground up in a mortar and pestle are added to a little water and mixed in with the canned food.
5;My Dogs Love It!;One of my dogs is really smart and spits out pills if I try to disguise it in things like bread and cheese. He swallows them right up with pill pockets though.
3;Inconsistent;First bag was very loaded with chocolate chips -every piece in the bag. Quite delicious.
5;Love this stuff!;I found this stuff when I switched to glueten free diet, but after adding glueten back to my diet, I still eat this several times a week. Some of the reasons I love this: it doesn't  become completely mushy, has a nice texture.
5;Music to My Palate;We like Plockys<br />They like us.<br />Plockys Plockys.
5;Great Product ... poor followthrough by Seller;I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.
5;Wonderful Hot Cocoa;GREAT! Hot Chocolate! By far the best Kcup hot chocolate I have found. I use a little milk or half and half and it's so.
5;Excellent!;I love these bars.  They are lighter and crisper than the nature valley brand.
5;Healthy;This is a great product at a great price. Speedy delivery added to the experience.
5;If you like sticky, you'll LOVE this product;"I've ordered a number of different kinds of ""Kind"" bars and ""Kind Plus"" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!  The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy."
2;never again.!!;i order these for my baby shower and unfortunately  i had to buy it again from another store because out of 80 sticks only 23 came out nice and unbroken. had to pay double the price it sucks.
5;Great for people on the go;I first ate Long Kow Crystal Noodle after finding it at a local Kroger store on clearance. I love ramen noodle soup and thought this might be a little different.
5;THE rice alternative;An Amazon Friend reviewed the Texmati White Rice recently. Today when I took this out of its spot, I thought: People should know how good this Royal Blend white, brown, wild, and red rice really is.
4;These are really tasty jelly sticks;My boyfriend purchased a two-pound bag of these at BJ's and they are very, very good.  Do note, however, that the orange slices pictured on the front of the bag implies that these are oranges covered in chocolate which they are not.
5;still don't want to make a title;Everyone who likes A-1 steak sauce has loved this one. It is very aromatic.
4;Vegan Alfredo;Like other reviewers already stated, the directions for how much H2O to add is WAAAAAY off! Following the directions will yield a gummy clump! The directions say to add 1/2 cup of H2O. When I make it, I add TWO cups of soy milk & vegan butter.
1;sickly;It
5;Stonewalls is the best;If you're looing for a nice inexpensive jerky treat, you'd be hard pressed to find better. Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find.
3;Time for Tea;roduct arrived timely. Six boxes.
1;Dog Food was excellent - but, don't count on it...;Our dog has many allergies, and - finally - we found a dog food that he can tolerate.  Happy Days!!  But, Wellness wasn't selling enough of the Salmon and Rice - so, they took if off the market.
4;get a boost;When i first received this product i was nervous to try it but after hitting amed day slump one afternoon i decided to try it. my first time using it I was really surprised by how much energy i had with no side effects.
4;Will drinking this brand make you drink more water?;Although the 1.5 Liter size is a bit too large to carry around conveniently, the water does taste good.
5;Surprisingly Tasty!!;I first discovered Orgain (chocolate flavor) at Farm to Market. Although very skeptical, I found the high protein content to be appealing, so I purchased it, and cautiously tried it a couple days later, room temperature.
4;Earl Grey's New Look;The recent 100 count box of Earl Grey arrived in different packaging.  The lighter, less sturdy cardboard roused curiosity about the contents.
5;Just right for this low carb snacker!;OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar.
4;Too salty!;Otherwise great. If you're a saltoholic like my husband you'll love these.
4;Great taste;These cookies are really good, you wouldn't even know they are gluten free if you didn't read the package. My only complaint is the size is a little small for the money althogh the individual packages are really nice to help with portion control.
4;Wife likes it;My wife loves our local Road Ranger gas station cappuccino. Nothing else will do, until now.
5;Was happy to find product available;This product was no longer available at my local grocery store.  I drink it every morning as part of my weight loss/blood sugar control and was very disappointed that the store no longer carried it.
5;A great big bag of good coffee...ahhh;Got the new coffee maker and grinder and have been experimenting with different types of coffees.  I've tried some of the expensive types but I have to say this really is a great coffee.
4;"A ""Must Have"" for our dogs";Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards.
4;Yummy!!  Addicted!!;I love this cappuccino for my Keurig!  It is the only product I use with it.  I just wish they would come out with more flavors, like White Chocolate Mocha, or something.
5;Another home run for Newman's Own;I really enjoyed the (alas, all too small) sample of Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate provided to me by the Amazon Vine Program.  Make no mistake, it's a serious, rich, and elegant chocolate, perfect for those times when you want something better than the goodies on the rack next to the register at the supermarket.
5;Great Product;I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.
5;Always at your fingertips;Very simple, place the drawer under your coffee maker. Its out of the way and holds your favorite coffee pods.
5;coffee review;Of course the product was great..
5;Great food;My dogs love it. I own two Yorkies.
4;Quaker;I really enjoy Quaker's products and the fact that they are more healthy than most other products. These were really good especially if you like raisins.
4;Nice gift!;It made a nice gift this Holiday Season, and taking one to work gave us all a chance to try new flavors.<br />The price per bar is higher, and I noticed even my minimalist sister had a hard time recycling the cute box.
5;wonderful rich taste;I like a strong rich coffee in the morning to wake me up. Tully's fits the bill.
5;my son devours these;If left to his own devices, my son would eat the entire container of these snacks. He *loves* them and the one time I handed him the container he threw a massive fit when I tried to take them away.
5;The best I've ever had!;I've tried a lot of coconut oils and this is the best I've ever had! Why? It tastes amazing, for some reason it has a lighter taste, and it's cold pressed and extra virgin. I cook with it, eat it straight out of the jar, put it on my lips and face, and make yummy desserts with it.
5;they love them;My dogs absolutely love these!  They are a bit pricey but seem to be good quality.  Thanks dingo!!  I have small dogs.
5;Good coffee;I have used this site and brand for birthday present and christmas present. It is a very good german coffee.
5;Morning Beverage;An excellant tea for Keurig Brewers..
5;Great in the afternoons;I like to keep these handy at work for afternoons when I don't really want to drink coffee.  Mixed with cold water, its refreshing and a great pick me up.
5;Thank You Evolve!;I have a cat with a VERY sensitive tummy. For two years everything he ate he vomited.
4;What happened to the price?;I have always bought this brand on subscribe and save for$28.20 now it's for sale on amazon for double the price!  What happened!  Absolutely love this instant coffee for the taste.
5;Commercial food companies helping celiacs;I am extremely sensitive to gluten. Having been diagnosed back in 1996, finding gluten free products was a daunting task.
4;Yummy!;"I am currently preggo, so I reached for this the other day after I had a rough day and work and needed a ""drink"". Since one packet makes a whole pitcher and I only wanted a glass (kinda wish they were single-serve), I just opened a packet and dumped in and stirred powder into a glass of ice water until it tasted potent enough for me."
5;Another good one;This is my second best, other than the Kahlua by Timothy's. I recommend it if you do not like flavoured coffee
5;These are indeed Life Savers;If you've ever tried to get your dog to swallow pills, you know how wonderful these are.  We have four dogs (three Corgis and a mixed breed), and all like them, and these have been successful with them all.
5;Beyond Delicious!;This soup is so good! The flavor is intense and the prep is simple. Beats out many restaurants.
2;Not a hit;I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.
4;really good;My husband takes a Kind bar with him to work everyday. He eats it for his afternoon snack.
3;A decent sugar substitute;Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a highly concentrated additive that can be mixed with water to create a sweet drink that gives you a does of vitamins as well.  The fruit punch flavor is pretty tasty and a much healthier alternative to the sports drinks and powdered sugar mixtures that are my usual.
5;Fresher than what I buy at my local store;I noticed the product was moister than what I buy locally.  Also, my cat likes it better.
4;Love it;Loooove, love, love this product! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the small inconvenience of having to mix it first. The taste and consistency is definitely 5 stars.
5;INCREDIBLE!  A TRIUMPH!;I  have a  problem  with sugar  addiction.  I love candy and  am trying to ween  myself  slowly off of  sugar.
3;go for turkey if first time;We have tried this a few times. Firstly I never seem to get it fully rehydrated, so I end up giving it to our pup as a soup.
5;Best soda;And only one I really like. Slightly bitter, but still quite sweet, it's great with a slice of lemon and a few ice cubes.
2;Don't expect anything more than a piece of candy;"Well, it's fine if you want something sweet, but in order to get any ""benefit"" you're supposed to have 3 of these.  That would equal 15 g."
5;Hard to find;I have always loved Nature Valley's Crunchy Granola Bars, but these are something special. The blend of oats and cocoa, along with chunks of dark chocolate, is perfect.
4;Pretty good but you can do better;Pill pockets usually work well though sometimes my dog will chew them, find the pill and spit it out.  Here's an easy way to make a vehicle for getting pills into your dog that isn't as portable as Pill Pockets but often works better.
4;Not a mocktail but still nice.;Not bad tasting at all.  Sometimes I want to drink something that isn't water and that is when Crystal Light comes in.
5;Great substitute for soy sauce;My family loves the taste of Braggs.  I like that it is lower in sodium than even the light soy sauce I was using.
5;Put it in a smoothie;Yesterday, I was given a sample packet of this hemp protein powder at one of the local health food stores in town.<br />After just now reading all the reviews, I decided to go ahead and make a smoothie in my Vitamix blender with banana,<br />apple, germinated almonds (plumped not sprouted), half a bunch of parsley, half and half mix of coconut milk and<br />water (I don't like ice in my smoothies), and of course the contents of the packet.
1;Totally changes the taste  and texture of a smoothie;It really changes the taste too and texture of a milkshake / smoothie - almost feels like there is mud in the drink. Bob's Red Mill's Whey Protein is a much superior product when it comes to drinkability.
5;A SUPER ADDITION TO OUR PANTRY!;This sauce was highly recommended by Roger Ebert in his recent cookbook, which caught our interest.  If memory serves he recommended this for both his rice dishes and steaks.
4;Flavorful Tea;I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.
3;Too Pricey;Buyers regret:  nice healthier sugar but way to expensive for 4 lbs not even certified as organic.  You can get 25 lbs for roughly twice the price of these 4 at Florida Crystals.
5;Very good orange spice tea.;I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised.
5;Delicious chips;Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.
2;DISAPPOINTED;I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.<br />IT IS SUPER SUPER SALTY.
3;Good value, just not my favorite flavor;The product was delivered as expected.  I really was looking for the Starbuck's Italian Roast, but thought I would try this based on some reviews.
4;Nestle's Fat Free for Me;I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.
5;wow;The garlic are good but the vinegar and salt are the best. I am so addicted I signed up for the bi-monthly shipments.
5;Regional soda;Cheerwine is a regional soda from North Carolina, that has expanded into 12 other southeast states in the last 8 years. Started in 1917, Cheerwine was first formulated in the basement of L.
5;So good!;This is my first experience with Rapadura, and let me tell you, it was so good! The flavor took me back to the days of my youth when my father would cut and peel a piece of raw sugar cane right at the stalk for me to chew on. Delicious molasses flavor adds so much body to my coffee and baked goods.
5;Elated!!;My grandaughters returned to the states this past Sept. from living in Italy for the last 3 years.
5;Great For Portion Control;I'm new to ordering food items through Amazon, but I'm already an advocate.  Prices are reasonable and the convenience is awesome - also, I'm able to order some items from home that I used to have to go to separate grocers to purchase therefore this is saving me time and money!  The only negative for me is that Amazon does not yet make nutrition information available on the food pages.
5;These contain a fair amount of SOY...if you have a sensitivity...;Popchips Original Potato Chips are dee-lish.  But BEWARE of the SOY in them if you have a soy sensitivity, like I do.
5;My new favorite tea;I've had Earl Grey tea before and enjoyed it, so I decided to try this brand and LOVED it. The flavor is really full and the aroma when it brews is wonderful.
3;Tasty;A refreshing, tasty beverage that can be used not only for smoothies, but for cooking as well.  Especially in a polynesian stir fry or curry dish.
5;Great Product, Hands Down!;As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints.
5;GREAT for low carb/glycemic diets;This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.
4;Jet Fuel K-cup;I used to drink Organic but it doesn't seem to be available anymore. I drank it because I liked the taste, not because of the name.
5;New lower price, no brainer.  Great formula.;Disregard the old reviews about price.  At 27.
4;Yummy;The directions are vague, at best.  But we're sure that with playing around with the proportions, we'll come up with a great pot of pho.
5;Blows away store-bought;This food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap. My dog's coat got softer within days, his breath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better.
4;Great taste for a picky baby, but very thin compared to others;My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters.
3;great taste;"Great tasting, small in size like a ""Smarties"" candy. Made with Xylitol."
5;Great Sparkling Water;I like the Crystal Geyser 18 ounce water. This is a refreshing water to drink by itself, or mixed with fruit juice.
5;Fun in the Sun;Who would expect a bored 22 year old (at the time) would have so much fun with little bouncy balls?  I ordered this item a couple years ago and never wrote a review..
5;Excellent Product;We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent.
4;Not sure it helps much;I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication. I am not sure it helps him that much at all, but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it.
5;Amazingly light & Delicately sweet;The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.
5;Delicious !;If you love chocolate truffles and raspberries, you will love this coffee.  Flavors are not overbearing -- just enough to enhance the coffee.
4;Kashi - Cinnamon Harvest;Great cereal but the biscuits in some boxes get really shredded so you're left with the loose stuff at the bottom (which I don't like as much).  The Amazon subscribe-and-save makes it much cheaper and more convenient than buying from my local supermarket.
5;Awesome Snack;It's candy just to be clear but with slightly less guilt. The flavors taste like real fruit (they use real juice so this makes sense).
5;Tastes Great but concerned about manufacturing processes;To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits.
5;Better than an almond joy bar;If you love almond joy candy bars like me, or coconut, you will love this sinfully healthy snack bar.  It is so delicious that you forget you are eating healthy! Highly recommend this tasty treat.
5;Wonderful in yogurt!;I have not yet tried to mix this with water and spread it like regular PB, but it's terrific in plain Greek yogurt, with some Truvia or Splenda added.  It seems to make the yogurt more filling and rib-sticking too
5;Best Thai Sweet Chili sauce;This sweet chili sauce by Mae Pranom is the real deal. Forget those overly sweet alternatives.
2;Strong Branding, Weak Flavor;I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager.
5;Divine!;So flavorful and smells like heaven.  Great price compared to stores.
5;Seriously?;Don't even waste your time ordering this bag of soup from this vendor. It's advertised as 1 bag - and you can get 1 bag of the same soup at your local grocery store for under 4 dollars.
4;refreshing;I am terrible te about drinking enough water in a day.  It is just too boring for me most of the time.
1;DON'T BUY!!!;I purchased these on Auto-Ship. Unfortunately I didn't think the order went thru & pushed it again.
2;I wouldn't bother.;"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay."
5;Totally satisfied;I love this pickle. My order was at a very fair price and arrived timely & in perfect order.
5;"Great way to prevent ""dog breath""";Within days of starting a routine of one petite Greenie each day (my dog is 20 pounds), dog breath is gone.  It did not upset his GI tract, and he loves the taste.
1;Tastes good, but the cereal came with more crumbs than whole pieces;I like this flavor, and none of the stores around me sell it.  The boxes (4 came in the order) have more crumb pieces than whole pieces.
5;GREAT FOOD AND PRICE.;GREAT FOOD AND PRICE FOR THIS ITEM. THE INGREDIENTS ARE PRETTY GOOD- AND MOST OF ALL THIS FOOD IS TONS BETTER THAN THAT DRY FOOD STUFF FOR MY OLDER CAT.
5;100% Juice Blend - What's Not To Love?;Love it, Love it, LOVE IT!  This is a very tasty<br />100% juice blend of five different juices, including<br />grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, plum juice,<br />and pomegranate juice - blended just right for a taste<br />you won't be able to stay away from!  Why waste money<br />buying something that's only 30% juice (or less) and<br />packed with high fructose corn syrup when you can buy<br />this 100% juice product?  Your body will love you for<br />it, and your health will naturally improve greatly<br />because you are giving your body REAL NUTRIENTS instead<br />of just a bunch of sugars.  Throw away the unhealthy<br />sugary soft drinks that do nothing for your body,<br />and get you some 100% juice Ocean Spray! Another<br />reason to buy this is you don't have to worry about<br />letting your kids drink it.
1;Tastes like licking a charred raspberry;Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.
5;My cat likes the taste;My cat is 13 years old.  I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued.
4;Small Havanese love these, but...;My two dogs love these..
1;Radical Price Increase;We can still get this at local supermarkets, Targets, Walgreens, etc for $10 each, so unless you are living in a remote mountain cabin or on a desert island, I would not buy it here. The instant coffee itself is excellent.
5;Outstanding dog treats (Not);My dog loves them.  I purchased them way cheaper at Amazon than at the market.
4;Love It, but would like nuts or sunflower seeds;We've been looking for some time for a reasonably priced trail mix to take on our hikes, especially hikes we take on vacation. While we like Costco's taste-wise, the pieces of dried fruit are too large as is the original bag.
5;Our favorite everday tea!;"We drink this tea quite often, and really enjoy it. While not a connoisseur's tea by any means, it makes a good, strong, ""cuppa char"" to go with your breakfast, sammie, or cookies."
4;workout candy;Life Saver Wint-o-green life savers --2 50 oz. bags came as advertised.
5;Great Help for Bad Breath!!;I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad breath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats.
4;The best that I've tried of the K-Cup tea offerings;I've been drinking tea for years mostly for health reasons.  We recently bought a Keurig so I tried this black tea with our new brewer.
3;IT is okay but I like the chocolate chip better;"This is coming from a chocolate lover.  I ordered the ""extreme chocolate"" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge."
2;Nasty tea debris everywhere!;When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile.
5;Excellent;These are light and very good. I am very happy with ingredients and don't mind when kids pick up for a snack.
3;great product!;I bought this for my Mom to use for her maltese. She needed it to remove redness around the eyes and it works great.
5;Bought Apple, Grape & Cherry;I remember these from my childhood, and randomly, I decided to look online and found them here.  I went overboard and bought 3 different flavors, so now I have LOADS of candy around.
5;This cured my corgi's arthritis and helped his allergies.;I have an eight year old corgi who is my security system and my baby.  He has had allergies all of his life, but recently they had gotten worse, with him having open sores on his underbelly, and bloodshot eyes, despite bi-weekly baths and benadryl.
5;The kid likes it!;Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available.
5;proud pup;love this cereal, even in the summer. I add brown sugar for sweetness.
5;Great product / Made in the USA;This product is great.  I am in Iraq and like that we can mail this without having it melt like ofther sweats.
5;Champion Prunes;I have purchased (3) cases and I feel they are a great value. The quality is good and I'm a satisfied customer.
4;Good Juice;I just discovered this great way to 'dirty' a martini.  So much easier than trying to drain the juice off of a bottle of olives.
5;Best fudge ever!;I don't eat sweets but I eat fudge and have had the pleasure of tasting many a fine recipe but none have been as tasty as Mo's - none.<br />I tried the standard chocolate and the vanila crunch and it was to die for.
2;I fell asleep after two cups.;Maybe i just drink too much coffee and i'm used to it..
1;Way too expensive;You can buy this elsewhere for $8-$9 for an 8-oz container.  Why Amazon is charging almost double that is beyond me.
4;Dog Loves it;My 13 lb dachshund is extremely destructive with his toys and needs a lot of interaction with most toys constantly.  I filled this toy with organic cheerio type cereal and he was delighted.
1;what a strange idea;Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on.
5;Couldn't be better!;Scharffen Berger Chocolate is one of the best premium chocolate bars out there. When they were based in Berkeley, I had taken a tour of the factory and was able to taste many of their bars.
5;Nutritional information;These bars are one of my favorites.  They are the lowest in calories of all the Larabars, too.
2;All cans badly dented crushed;The packaging was fine, so these were already crushed when Amazon packed them. EVERY CAN damaged, something large must have been dropped on them.
5;Peanut Butter Stir;It really works and clean up is much easier than using a spoon.  The lid didn't fit our store brand plastic jar (too big), but it was still a better option.
4;Delicious Bunnies Don't Come Cheap, Silly Wabbit;These are delicious. Several servings seem to be needed to satisfy.
5;my son's favorite!;I am very pick when it comes to selecting brands/products for my son. Earth's Best is a great brand, and their oatmeal is excellent.
4;like it...dont love it;If you cant deduce the jist of my review based on the title, stop reading now because you never will. This is a totally personal thing, I just, honestly do not like this as much as other coffees Ive tried.
5;Great Product!;I love these..
5;Best Tea Ever;I highly recommend trying this tea. It is amazing.
1;Dangerous Choking Hazard;My 30 lb. male corgi nearly died from eating this.
4;Great;Just the right thing for my meats. Good stuff.
5;taste great;These noodles are delicious and surprisingly my favorite of all the flavors so far. I orderd some for my daughter also and son.
1;Bizarre flavor;Tastes like someone dunked them in rose water. Couldn't stand them.
5;Let's go Brew-ers;If you've had a brat at Miller Park there is a good chance you've used the Secret Stadium Sauce.  I don't know what it is, I don't know want to know, but I will continue to slather it over my brats.
5;GREAT!;I use this on my morning oatmeal and I use it in cooking. Wonderful flavor! Excellent value for your money.
5;Verifiably Vet Approved;It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel.
4;Good Value, High Quality;The nibs are high quality, with nice color and flavor.  The packaging is not good for storage, (it tears easily), so we transferred them to a Tupperware bin and that works fine.
5;Le Village Black Label Papillon Roquefort;The first reviewer must not have much experience with Roquefort cheese they are ALL salty! I have eaten many different varieties of this luscious cheese and this is by far the best I have tasted.  Pair a couple of thick slices of this well-marbled cheese with grapes, sliced apples and other fruits plus a nice wine (white is my preference).
5;Great Pasta - Good price with subscribe and save;Product Quality: De Cecco pasta is the best widely available commercial pasta.  If you want better pasta, you'll pay through the nose or you'll make it yourself.
1;Poor quality - old;I have purchased Godiva chocolates a few times and have always found them to be old and dried out.  I think the company has a problem with keeping stock fresh.
5;Natural is the only way!;I purchased this product because of its Natural ingredients and multi uses.  But, I really purchased this product as a pre-shampoo treatment that can be used the night before with heat before you Shampoo your hair for a beautiful natural shine.
5;Cotton Candy Sugars;This product works nicely with my cotton candy machine and the flavors taste good. I would recommend this item not only because the product is high quality but because the seller gave me quick courteous service.
4;Worth the money, but nothing to write home about.;First of all, shipping and packaging went very well. I'm impressed in that regard.
5;A great little snack;At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.
5;A must have for every home;For all the stomachaches everyone gets sooner or later. I put honey in it to make the children like it even more.
5;So Good why isn't it Bad???;After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food.
3;Great syrup, badly packaged;Great syrup!  Thick, dark and perfectly sweet.  Ideal for oatmeal and pancakes.
3;Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green;I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste.
2;Very pricey and not too big of a hit;I have three cats.  Now mind you, all three of theses cats LOVE to eat.
4;Smells good;And tastes yummy when you fry plantains with it. I had a bad sunburn last year on my shoulders.
5;Tongue Scrapers Just Right;For some reason the rigid plastic tongue scrapers are hard to find in stores.  The flexible tongue cleaners are not in my view satisfactory.
1;Worst K-Cup yet - And I am easy to please!;I wanted a nice hot cup of cider. I forced myself to choke down the first cup I tried.
4;Tasty and healthy;Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use.
5;Dark, rich and my morning wakeup;I used to order my coffee from Kauai, but now I order this coffee from Amazon. I like a dark, bold coffee and this one fits the bill.
5;Love it!!!!;I love Weaver's Coffee.  I got some at my friend's local Whole Foods in Frisco, but it's hard to find around Los Angeles.
1;Over-fried;I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural.
5;Excellent;I was a little hesitant at first since they didnt have a small sampler of it.  The Keurig web site is always out of it.
3;Disappointed in expiration date;I like to buy this milk in bulk for longer term storage. I was disappointed that the order I just received on July 2nd has an expiration date of September 9th.
4;A nice kick start in the AM;Highly recommend this illy product. Takes wonderful, gives a nick kick in the morning and generally keeps the energy level high for several hours.
4;If you are in a hurry its good.;This is good for when you are in a hurry to make breakfast.  I haven't used it for general baking yet.
5;Best Ginger snap thin cookies ever!;I could munch on these cookies all day.  They are thin and VERY flavorable.
5;Organic, healthy, and incredibly tasty (according to Lily the golden retriever);Lily, my fourteen-year-old golden retriever volunteered to test Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. I didn't tell her that they were good for her.
5;rich tasting oatmeal;Purchased steel cut oatmeal over traditional oatmeal for the greater health benefits.  Surprisingly rich taste over regular oatmeal
5;Very Good;I bought these for busy days at work when I don't have time for lunch, and to lose a little wieght. The chocolate makes them taste like a treat, not a diet.
3;Slow Delivery;It took about a month to get this item..
5;Fenugreek powder;Arrived quickly, thank you! I bought this to increase my breastmilk production and only had to use it for 1 day before I noticed an improvement.  The taste isn't great, so I plan on only using it if I notice another dip.
3;Not the size i ordered;Cookies will be great but did not order this size. I ordered the one with i think it was 6 packages.
5;Be informed and enjoy;This product is no longer being widely distributed and is not listed on Nabisco's product page. It's key that you keep in mind the product you're buying, so if you haven't purchased this item previously, be advised.
5;Rich & Indulgent Kenya AA Whole Bean Coffee;My husband is a complete coffee nut and we both love this coffee.  Kenya AA is rich and less acidic than other coffees.
5;Quick coffee by Keurig;A friend offered us a cup of decaf after we had been out to dinner with him and his wife.  We accepted and enjoyed the coffee made with a Keurig very much.
5;Not Too Salty;Got these at Rite-aid last night.Came across them from the cashier.
5;She loves it!;Bought this for my wife's birthday with a variety pack of cups to put in it. She loves it, looks good on the counter, well made, arrived quickly and as promised.
3;Just a normal hot pepper and nothing more or less;From reading some other reviews about these sorts of dried peppers I was prepared for them to be something special, but they are not.<br /><br />They are fine, but they are not specially hot nor do they have any special flavor.
5;Cheerios are still the best cereal!;When it comes to breakfast cereal, I can't think of any type that I enjoy more than Cheerios.  They have a delicious taste, I never seem to get tired of eating them, and best of all, they are fairly healthy as well.
5;Simple and Elegant;These bars have unmistakable taste and aroma of cherries. The flavor is slightly acidic.
5;seriously, these are good enough for humans to eat;i have never been able to resist taking one of these dog cookies for myself, as soon as that smell hits you when you open the bag. these are super super good.
5;Very good gf/df healthy cracker;My son does not eat wheat or dairy, so I only make food gf/df and this is a great cracker that also has a lot<br />of nutrition.  We use these crackers mostly to eat with our soups, but they are a great snack as well.
2;Didn't strike a chord with my palate;Background: Roasted chicken is something my wife and I often eat on Sundays and we like to try different things from time to time.  I tried this seasoning on a brined whole roasted chicken with a liberal application of the rub.
5;Bright colorful taste;Even though it's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor.  In this way it's even better than standard dried fruit.
1;Not durable!;We bought these bottles about 1month ago. Our daughter is very picky about bottles a chokes on many nipples.
5;Ideal Healthy Snack;The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface.
1;gross and SUPER small portion size;im a 21 year old 140 5'9 male..
2;You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?;This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.
4;Good stuff;Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.
1;Really quite awful;I purchased several of these the other day after all of the hype I've heard surrounding them.<br /><br />Long story short, they taste awful.
5;Everyone loves these, including toddlers!!;"We discovered these when my son was 3 years old, he is now 4 and still loves his ""pea pods"". Also, all of his little friends are also into them."
5;Oh my !;These are soo good with a nice cup of coffee. They are light, buttery and very flavorful with the finely chopped nuts.
5;Keurig Hazelnut K-Cups;Following my recent divorce my ex-wife got custody of the Mr. Coffee machine.
3;ok;My cat will eat it, and I'll use it in a pinch when I am out of Wellness canned cat food.  I wish it came in a fish only flavor.
4;the real taste of an Italian coffee;This is my favorite one. I'm Italian and I used to drink this coffee also in Italy.
1;yucccky crackers;I had tried this craxker in a snack pack at Starbucks..
5;Great Brand, Good Product;This cream of tartar does everything it is supposed to and arrived very fresh. We use it in baking and also for DIY kids crafts, and it is very effective.
5;Can't resist them!;I frequently skip meals when I'm on the run.  These bars have 10 grams of protein and they're delicious.
2;Don't waste your money;I was able to get a huuuuge version of this for $3 more  when I went to Cancun, unfortunately I had accidentally packed it on the carry on and it was confiscated.  I personally don't think paying $21 for 7 oz is worth it.
5;Awesome Green Tea;I tried drinking Green Tea because people say that Green Tea is good for your health.  However I could not find any that is good until I try Batavia tea.
5;Fantastic aroma and taste!;I purchased this lavender to make lavender lemonade for a bridal shower and it went over very well. Cooking the lavender made our whole house smell like a spa and it tasted fantastic.
5;Excellent Coffee;I love this blend.  Taste is rich but not overpowering.
5;Half and Half;Had this at the Marshfield fair in Marshfield, MA.  They were giving it out.
5;It's All About the Flavor!;"I was cruising the aisles of my local ""largest retailer in the US"" super store one day and spotted the rooster-adorned bottle with the green lid.."
5;One word:  Amazing!;This is the best dark cocoa I have ever had!  It makes incredible mochas and hot chocolate and I use hardly any sugar in it (I like it a little bitter) and it makes a mocha better than Starbucks, Ryan Bros, Butch Bros, Peets - anyone.  It makes me feel good knowing there's a lot less sugar,  but I do wonder about the fat content as it seems a lil bit on the high side.
5;ziwipeak venison and fish;My cats will come back for more of this product. It is also easy to feed,I just sprinkle on top of the wet food I am feeding at the time.
5;Flavorful! Arrives in good shape. No peanuts here!  Repeat buyer.;Nice to have a source for this great Chex Mix. It hits the spot!<br /><br />Chex Mix of old had peanuts.
5;The worst part of my cat's day is now the best!;I have struggled for over a year and a half in giving my cat a daily pill.  She foams and vomits easily and she and I both dread this daily torture.
5;Awesome!;I felt deeply motivated to say that I have to disagree with the reviewer who said these smell like old ketchup. I just didn't get that at all.
5;The best have-on-hand-always snack ever!;I'm so happy I found these pretzels after years of hoping Nabisco's Mr.Salty Veri-thin stick pretzels would return! I bought almost all the store had as it was a temporary item.
5;robin;great and just as described.  My husband loves it.
5;How can you not love these.;I have been eating these things since I was a kid.  They are delicious and nutritious.
5;Perfect for the whole family;I have three children and only one is gluten intolerant. We ALL love this granola.
4;Tired of Price increases.;Have gotten this about 2 years now on subscription. Just cancelled it because the price increases, way too often.
5;My favorite!;This is my favorite late evening cup of coffee.  Nice flavor, just right before retiring for the night.
5;finally coffee for my picky palate!;Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.
5;Crunchy, tasty cookies;These are indeed very crunchy so if you prefer the soft, chewy type you won't like these. But since I like crunchy, I like these a lot.
4;Wish it was stronger- still a good flavor;I wish that this K-cup was a little bit stronger.  I love the pumpkin spice flavor but I wish it had a bit more boldness to the coffee part.
1;horrific looked like they had just found a twig and loped off the top!;horrific! It looked like they had just found a twig and loped off the top! And that was just for starters. It was sent in the middle of winter (a Christmas gift from my mom and dad I might add)But it was still hadn't droped it's leaves.
5;This one supplement has changed my life!;I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.
5;Excellent coffee;I had used SF Bay coffee(French roast) in the past but didn't know it was available for my Keurig one cup brewer. I absolutely love this coffee and have placed an order for more French Roast as well as Fog Chaser.
5;Good;It's really good, I bought it and drink it all the time. I gave it 5 stars cause its the best.
5;great decaf;great decaf. Recommended.
3;good taste...but tiny amount in each one..;I like the taste of this jerky, but they could easily fit 5 times the amount in each container and if your not incredibly careful opening each one you will find the tiny amount you got is now all over the carpet. I've purchased single unites at the store and it seemed much more tightly packed.
5;Love it;Good for taste and good for health. Specially, this cereal includes honey that I wanted to take regularly for its super benefits.
5;Great Deal;If you can get these on sale, these can be a great bargain. They come in small packages and don't need to be refrigerated or frozen.
5;Hard to find!;Glad Amazon had this - my husband's been looking for it for a while now as our local grocery store stopped carrying it.  It was expensive, but it will last a very long while.
5;Excellent - boldest K-cup available;"In search of the strongest and richest K-cup coffee available, we tried every ""bold"" and every ""dark roast"" K-cup made.  This is far and away the best."
5;found them again;Was able to get this type of noodles (creamy chicken) before one of our major grocery stores folded. No one in the area has the selection they used to carry.
5;picky puppy...;I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.
4;Nice Coffee, Pods Didn't Work for Us;I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.
5;Quick and easy recipe - low in sodium and fat!;I had been searching for recipes for my mother-in-law who is on a sodium and fat restricted diet for congestive heart failure. I spent hours on the internet and was successful at a few recipes but really needed something quick.
4;Good taste - but not really a coffee cake;This mix produced a good cake, but it wasn't really what I would consider a coffee cake.<br /><br />The cake had the consistency of an angel food cake, though it was a bit more dense than a true angel food cake.
5;Crunchy deliciousness;These bars are crunchy, non-sticky, healthy, filling, and absolutely delicious. I bought a box on a whim because I needed a gluten free snack to keep in my cabinet at work.
5;Very good if you like Chai Tea;Either you like it or you do not. We do, so it is 5 stars.
5;Love the original - not so much the jalapeno or the sweet potato.;We've re-ordered the original potato Popchips several times since we first tried them.  They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.
5;Great product/vender;The vender for both this product and buying experiance gave service and help far and above both expectations and any, I repeat any previous Amazon.com purchase.
5;Excellent, great taste!!;I don't like wine so this is a great substitute with a great taste.  I love it and will order it again in the future.
5;my favorite;This product is the best choice for adding calcium+vitD and protein in your diet. Cow's milk gives me stomach trouble whereas this doesn't.
5;Wonderful;Fantastic product, just as stated. Not disappointing.
5;My maltese is crazy about these!;My 4 year old Maltese is fussy about snacks, chews, and treats--bank tellers, friendly folks carry treats have no sway with my little girl. But.
1;bait and switch;I purchased the pack of five for $23.59.
5;Have it on auto-delivery!! YUMMY!;This is wonderful! It is the best tasting sugar-free sweetener I have ever had. Delicious in both hot and cold drinks! I have it on auto-delivery.
4;My chihuahua loves them!;My chihuahua Rocco loves Greenies.  He is a little over 5 lbs but can scarf one down in no time.
5;Good stuff!!!;At first, I thought it was a bit bland. But, I started using a bit more and cooking it down just a bit more which helped a lot and brought out a very nice balance of spicy, soy and sweet flavors.
5;A Tasty and Satisfying Snack;Flavorful, quick, easy, and healthy.<br /><br />It is not a spicy hot curry, but it's definitely not bland.
5;Love!;Great quality for a really good price, with all the health and skin benefits its been a regular item in my house. I make a batch of agua de jamaica about once a week, and im still not done with my first bag.
3;When is a noodle not a noodle?;Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles.
1;The Company With NO customer service skills!;I am unsure of the plant quality yet. However .
5;Good food. No wait. No kidding.;Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner is a food kit that is easy to prepare, tastes great, and can be eaten as an entree or a side dish. Just supply your own boneless chicken breast.
5;Great food!;My 9 month old pitt loves this food, it only took him about 3 days to adjust to it. His energy level is great, shiny healthy coat, his allergies seemed to have gotten better.
3;Weak coffee;It's organic, arabica coffee packaged in pods. I was looking forward to great tasting, conveniently packaged coffee.
5;Little cake with a big punch;The whiskey cake is the size of a large muffin, such as the large muffins they have at Costco. The cake I received was very moist and the expiration date was about a year away.
5;A fresh, original film from master storyteller Tim Burton;This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before.
5;Not a fan of granola bars, but the taste of these wowed me;I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients.
4;Good, if you like flavored coffee;I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.<br /><br />So, lets get this out of the way.
3;Dark cup of tea missing aromatic oils;This decaf tea will make a dark cup of tea. However much of the aromatic oils that are part of the experience of drinking tea are missing.
1;way overpriced;hate to be repetitive, but I'm going to say what everyone else has. This is extremely overpriced.
1;don't buy this stuff;I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.
5;Wholesome and good...;If you like oatmeal cookies, you'll love this product.  The kids like to pack it in their lunchboxes, which is fine by me.
5;Awesome!;Tastes great!  Sure the amount in each varies slightly, but VERY slightly.  Tastes great and isn't very chunky there are a few now and then, but I didn't expect perfection anyway.
4;My cat loves it...;My cat loves it. This recipe does make the fur look shiney.
5;K-Cups;I received a great offer from Amazon to purchase 50 K-Cups at a reasonable cost.  I purchased the item and found it to be fabulous.
5;great in salads;My family loves to add a dollop of olive salad to a tossed salad for that little bit of extra oomph.  I was really glad to find it here on Amazon, when my local grocer stopped carrying it.
4;Senseo Dark Roast;Have been using Senseo products off and on for several years.  They gave me their coffee maker for promising to recommend it to ten others.
4;A Good Flavor;Most of the Gloria Jean's flavors I am not a big fan of, but this one would be the exception. I really enjoyed the flavor and it was a nice change from my normal routine.
5;Great cup of coffee;Van Houtte Creme Brulee is a very great tasting smooth coffee. I enjoy it very much.
1;Ick;I normally love Walden Farms foods, but this sauce is not at all what I expected. It has a very bitter, acidic taste to it.
3;Okay, but I think would be better cold!;I'm new to the hot tea party but open to try new ones so when I saw this on Amazon Vine, I decided to give it a go. Mostly because I've been intrigued by the pyramid tea bags for what feels like forever.
2;Ok for an expensive treat;
4;delicious coke is for the broke;No the only kind of drink, but damn good nonetheless. I prefer foxon park or another sugar based drink, but if there is none available, coke gets my vote.
2;Be Careful if using these long term;I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months.  He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets.
1;Would Not Blend and Instructions Confusing;I was disappointed with the Baby Brezza.  It steamed the veggies well but would not spin for blending.
4;Herbalife Lift Off;I found this works best if you take it first thing in the morning before eating or having coffee.<br />In about an hour you feel an energy surge that lasts about 4 hours.
5;Yoshida's a Great Sauce;Easy to order and came very well packed. Great grilling sauce.
5;Good Stuff!;I have been using Coconut water for about a year now and am pleased with the results.  More energy! More on top of things & mental alertness.
5;Highly addicitive chips;I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt.
5;just perfect;What can I say - they just work. No muss no fuss.
4;Understated vanilla as advertised in a smooth coffee;"Flavored coffees can be fun for mixing things up or even when you create your own coffee blends by mixing and matching. The vanilla in this coffee fusion is indeed understated as advertised, and you certainly do not get the overpowering ""fragrance counter"" experience when you open the bag for the first time."
4;Love this garlic salt!;This is my favorite garlic salt and I use it all the time.  This large size seems like a great deal and should last me a while!<br /><br />UPDATE: The holes on this container are actually larger than the smaller version you would buy at the store.
5;The best;I love San Marzano tomatoes and Cento's are great. They have the greatest, sweetest taste ever.
1;100% natural, but... - A Switch watermelon strawberry soda review;I received a can of the Switch watermelon strawberry soda through the Amazon Vine program.  The can, slim with a normal soda can height, contains 8.
5;Mushroom Popcorn;I am a popcorn lover and this popcorn was amazing.  It pops up great, really tasty, and quite a conversation piece.
4;Good Coffee;This is very good coffee for my new electric percolator.  I did reduce the amount of coffee I use as recommended on the package.
5;Great candy;This candy is really great.  Everybody that I have given it to also loves it.
5;great product;"I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste ""soapy."
5;Love this stuff!!!;I don't usually leave product reviews, but this stuff is worthy of doing so.  I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.
5;Lquid Nothingness;Liquid nothingness..
2;disappointment;The tea was okay.  However, the picture and description of these tea bags led me to believe that each bag would be in an individual paper wrap.
5;The Most Wonderful Dark Roast Coffee;The best dark roast coffee I've had. Intense, flavorful, robust coffee taste.
5;Ultimate Snack Food;I love these so much. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds, you will love these too.
5;Good Cup of Joe;We love our Keurig machine but found the kcups to be expensive.  This brand of coffee offers a strong, bold cup of coffee and at a lower price point that most of the others.
5;Very satisfied with product;My husband and I are very satisfied with this product.  Not only is it organic, it is easily digestible, and my daughter loves it.
5;Feel-Good Tea;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Good, but beware of the mismatch between title and  product info;"As of the date of this review, the product title indicates ""dark chocolate with orange flavor,"" but the picture and description are for their regular 72% dark chocolate bars.<br /><br />Vivani is perhaps my favorite chocolate, so I took a chance on this ambigious product hoping to get the 72% cocoa version."
5;Unique and yummy combination;I use this all the time on both salads as well as meats.  It pairs nicely with just about any type of food.
3;If you like cloves...;First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.
5;Maggi Seasoning Sauce MAGIC;It seems that conventional stores have little shelf space for the truly unique and great products.<br />Maggi Seasoning Sauce is a product that enhances the flavor of your foods, be it gravies, sauces or your specialty dishes, such as meat loaf or hearty stews and soups.
4;tasty treat;I have been a marzipan fanatic for over 55 years. While there are finer and fancier marzipans, in my opinion, for the money, this is a very nice, dependable product.
5;Good diet soda;One of the best diet variants out there.  (Other types I find quite good
5;Wonderful - love them;I agree with the other review.  I didn't know how this might taste but I was suprised how delicious it was - going to order lots more.
2;OK but not as good as the big bags.;I bought this same product in a health food store in bigger bags..
5;There is so much to learn about the worlds salts !;Himalayan Salt is mined from the mountains in Packistan and is said to be 99% pure and over 100,000,000 years old. It is beautiful looking as well as tasting and I have been entranced by this new discovery.
5;Only way to make Pumpkin pie!;I've used other sweetened condensed milk in the past, this is by far the best.  If I am using organic pumpkin for my pies then I don't want to add any ingredients that aren't.
5;roland sesame seeds wasabi flavor;These are fabulous.  A must have for the wasabi freak.
5;cat heaven;so easy to use.  my cats love it!  no more vomiting! i highly recommend this product and seller.
3;Great Taste - Less Filling....;These fruit gems were delicious as expected.  I went for this packaging as a nostalgic gift for me wife.
4;Very good Chai;This is a very good Chai and I drink some every day, but I prefer a Chai with a bit more spice, such as Trader Joe's chai.  Unfortunately Trader Joe's has discontinued it!  The Mystic Chai tastes about the same to me as the Target brand Market Pantry chai, and between the two I'd pick Mystic since the price per serving is lower.
5;Simply the best;I'm a rather picky tea drinker.  There's no comparison between Harney iced tea and any other type or brand.
1;This espresso machine looks pretty and makes horrible espresso;This expresso machine is horrible..
4;Fine product, but cans are very hard to open;This is a fine product.  Tastes great, and is organic.
4;Difference, anyone?;"I remember my dad giving a British friend of his a cup of tea made with Lipton 30 years ago.  To say in the least, dad's friend was a bit offended, and said, ""Disgusting way to make tea!""  Back then, however, Lipton was the only brand to buy here in the U."
5;Magically Delicious;I am currently 9 months pregnant and have been hooked on this stuff for the past two months (since I heard about it).  It is extremely thirst quenching, and has a great dark chocolate flavor.
3;Could be better but worth buying;There was much to read as to labels and ingredients of this sausage kit. We were disappointed to find MSG in the Italian sausage mix or else this would have received five stars.
5;Fantastic for On the Go;I am currently have limited access to healthy foods and this soup is amazing, all you need is a hot water kettle and a cup.  I use this along with the Amazing Grass Green Superfood and several other 'health' products to keep a decent meal plan going.
1;tastes like licorice :(;I bought these locally.  The price was high and I don't like the licorice taste!  I couldn't even finish the box.
5;love it!;I now use sun butter in place of peanut butter in some of my favorite recipes. My kids like to spread it on sliced apples.
5;Love it!;Jamican Me Crazy is the best coffee.  It is not too strong and has a unique taste.
5;Better than I expected;I will be re-ordering.  Great mix of flavors and only 3 pts a bag for weight watcher points.
5;Great for WLS folks--fools normies;After gastric bypass, I can't do regular pasta/macaroni any longer. Both regular pasta and whole wheat gives me horrible cramps and gas later (TMI).
5;Loved it!;My 8 month old daughter loved it.  When I don't make my own baby food, this particular brand and flavor is just what she likes.
1;too old;they taste good but weather its the peanuts or sunflower inside<br /> is rancid and taste old which upset my stomack and throw the<br />rest of the order out.a lot of times this is not because the<br />product sits on the shelves too long but the company uses cheap<br /> ingredients to begin with.
5;great value;I live in NYC and you can buy these bars anywhere, however they can range up to $3 per bar. this is a great value if you enjoy these bars.
3;Ok product....;A decent, middle of the road hamburger helper flavor. It tastes very similar to a salisbury steak with gravy.
5;Mom swears by it;This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works.
5;Really sour;Bought this candy for my teenage son that is addicted to sour candy and says nothing is sour enough.  It is definitely sour for the rest of us, I had to spit it out.
2;Dog-Man-Doo;"My cat will not touch it.  He gives me a ""are you kidding me"" look."
5;Go Gu!;LOVE the Gu! Easy on the stomach, easy to use during training, portable even during long runs or rides.<br /><br />It takes about 8 minutes after fueling with Gu for me to notice a difference during running.
4;Soooooo yummy and great texture!;OMG - these chips taste so good! I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones.
5;Mmmmmm, Vanilla Flavored Coffe;My wife first found this in Walgreen's and bought both Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors just to try them out. And here is our verdict: WE LOVED THEM.
1;Cheap-tasting Burnt Coffee;It's beyond me why this stuff has such great reviews. If you like the taste of burnt popcorn, then this coffee is for you! If you're like most people, however, and you're looking for a rich coffee taste DO NOT buy Lavazza.
2;Not What They Advertise;When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this.
2;barely any vanilla aroma or flavor;"As coffee, these kcups are just ok.  As ""flavored"" coffee these are disappointing."
5;Toasty;This stuff is exactly as described and I highly recommend you only use it in very small amounts.  I found myself going into a mild panic after I scooped a spoonful of it.
5;needs marketing change;As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.
5;My dogs love these things!!!;Our vet friend gave Busy Buddies to my dogs for Christmas.  What a life saver.
5;Great with Vanilla, Hard to find!;Just got my 12 pack. I wasn't sure what it would taste like because I couldn't find the UNSWEETENED AND VANILLA anywhere.
5;Is it time for my Orgain?;This is the best tasting protein drink I've ever tried!  I'm even thinking of pouring it over my morning cereal--it's that good.  I drink a carton of Orgain several times a week
4;Smells amazing;Ordered these beans to make my own vanilla extract. They were most and fragrant when I cut into them.
1;Inglehoffer mustard;First I was so disappointed that the Orange-n-Honey mustard is not available as it is my favorite, so I though the Honey-Maple would be a good second choice.  It was terrible tasting, I was so disappointed.
5;Couldn't live happily without;"I started to entitled this review ""Couldn't live without,"" but then decided that I could, in fact, live without my subscription of these Kalamata olives, just not as contentedly.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I rarely find a mushy one, and the mushiness quotient is certainly similar to what one finds in jars from the grocery."
5;HEY- IT'S REAL BUTTER AND GREAT ON STEAKS;For all you folks who say that it doesn't taste like butter- GET REAL. This is nothing more than clarified real butter.
5;Expensive but really good;I bought the extra concentrated version of EZ Sweetz<br />so most of my low carb recipes only require 6 drops,<br />which is great, you pay a little more but you use a LOT<br />less. I still think this is an expensive product.
1;Rip OFF;The produt description is untrue.  You don't get 850 you only get 200 it is not worth it trust me.
1;Don't Bother;I love the Medifast system and it has worked wonders for me.  I would not however purchase this product for essentially $33 when I can purchase it for half the cost directly from Medifast.
5;My favorite Kettle Chip;These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick.
5;love starbucks via;Starbucks via is great for when I don't have time to use my coffee press. Great quality coffee and it was a great price on amazon, about $0.
5;Baby Breeza makes feeding baby a breeze;Ibought the Baby Breeza for my daughter. She loves it.
5;Safty Suckers for little girls;My youngest granddaughter is 3 and loves her suckers.  These were around when I was a kid
5;Great Chips!;Love these chips.  You're eating more of a variety, not just another potato chip.
5;Love this dish! Paired with skillet ready veggie pack from Trader Joe.;I like curry and often eat out in restaurants were I pick these types of dishes.<br /><br />I made mine with potatoes, sliced beef and a package of roasted fiery veggies from Trader Joe [ready for skillet].
5;Great gift for Tea People;I sent this to my Mom for Mother's Day. She's a very picky person when it comes to gifts so when she wrote me saying what a surprise it was to get such a wonderful box with such nice teas in it I was very happy.
3;teriyaki tastes better than teriyaki beef;I love these yakisoba noodles. My favorite instant noodles of all time.
5;Dairy-free and delicious;These are the only dairy-free chocolate chips I have found in any grocery store, and they taste great. A tip.
5;Evanger's Whole Chicken Thighs;Product arrived on time and in great condition.  Nothing was bent.
5;Ruby Red Crystal Light;This product has been discontinued! Very sad! A shame more people didn't enjoy this.Great for diabetics! This is tart and sweet, just right.
1;Dog likes treat - company unresponsive to requests for information;While my dog really likes the treats from this company the company is unresponsive to requests related to their manufacturing in China. My DVM has concerns about the processing of these treats because of their origins in China and how they may not be as healthy as presented
5;Lovely...;I wasn't going to write a review, though the product is excellent..
5;Best tasting/effective;After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM.
1;Buyer Beware...Not K Cups;I did a search for Folgers K Cups and this product showed up.  I thought I was getting K Cups and I ordered both regular and decaf.
4;Great WILD blueberries;Eden is a great ethical company with superior products.  This is one of their few products I wouldn't give 5 stars to only because they are wild blueberries which I don't care for as much as cultivated varieties.
5;Finally. Bergamont.;"March update: Wife brings me the empty box of tea. ""I only have one more box left."
1;Oh My God;I want to like this, but I cannot. First off, the box the packets came in, was destroyed it was like someone ran over it 3 times.
5;Yum! helped me kick the caff habit;I bought this product because I wanted to wean myself off caffeine.  At least, the caff in coffee - I still drink black tea.
1;Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE;I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.
5;Dog likes;The dog seems to like this food and it comes in handy, foil sealed plastic containers with plastic lids, so storage between meals is easy.  They are less expensive on Amazon that at Walmart, so that's a definite plus.
4;Awesome Spices;This Sweet Smoked Paprika from Spain is really smoky and sweet.  You can really taste the difference than those spices in the grocery store.
5;Nice thick chunks of top quality licorice...;While perusing JIM'S APPLE FARM in southern MN, I came across this fine brand of licorice.  (Priced at only $3.
5;THE BEST ANIMAL CRACKERS EVER;"I just bought these for my daughter today at our local health food store and I was very skeptical, but now I'm addicted to these. I hate to say that I ate my daughter's cookies but I did and will ""sadly"" have to go buy her some more tomorrow."
5;Great tea;My husband's favorite loose green tea.  He drinks every morning, and it is a little better price than from Stash.
5;Really Good Coffee!;I love great coffee and I have tried many brands offered here on Amazon. This Lost Art Blend is perfect with the added benefit of being low acid.
2;will NEVER buy except from local grocer!! STALE!!!;i love amazon, and i love these bars! but ordering off of the internet is NOT the way to go on these and i should have listened to the other reviews..
5;A True Miracle for my 3 year old son!;"I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going ""poo"" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year"
5;Great for Dogs with Allergies;My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations.
5;Don't have to eat just one.......;These are delicious lower sodium/fat chips. Convenient lunch/snack size bag is enough for sharing.
4;Reeelaxing and Aromatic!;This jasmine tea is very fragrant and I noticed an instant calming effect after breathing it in for a few minutes.  The pearl balls are neat to look at inside of the silk satchet when you open the very fragrant pouch!  The taste is light and soothing, nothing too complicated.
5;You will never use regular salt again;"This makes everything taste a little better including sweets. It is not as ""salty"" as regular salt, so it has a more subtle earthy effect."
5;Best price you'll find;This is one of my favorite teas.  Stash's mix of green tea and chai spice is the best I have found.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
5;Like, omg;I am so glad I got two of these. The product is expensive for chocolate, but the quality is amazing.
5;Yum!;Never expected powdered peanut butter to be this good.  My favorite thing to use it on is my vanilla ice cream.
5;lcargile;I was a huge coffee drinker until I had some heart complications.  I no longer can have caffeinated coffee.
5;Yummy snack!!;Our family LOVES these!  They are thin, crispy with just enough salt!  Delicious!  Annie Chun does an excellent job!  The Korean seaweed makes a thinner, crunchier snack than the Japanese Nori, which is good for sushi.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these.
1;Read all the ingredients......awful!;Evaporated cane juice..
5;Great!;I used to feed my cat products from Castor and Pollux, but this time I tried something else against her weight issue.<br />Today is the second day, so I can't tell if it works but my cat loves this one, too.
5;Great Green Tea;This is an excellent green tea. I enjoy this brand and one from Biglow.
5;Green Mountain Hot Apple Cider;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Tasty;I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.
5;MY DOG LOVES IT;Not only does my dog love the food but it got here super quick and just in time for me to have enough food for my dog for the next month in a half or so. I have an english bulldog and it keeps him slim and in shape.
1;Terrible taste;I purchased this product from my local health food store.  It was still well within its sell-by date.
5;Best Snack Ever!!;I love these chips! This is the best snack ever!  And on top of that, it's healthy.  What a combo.
5;The Cream of Chicken with Herb you love;I've always liked the Cream of Chicken with Herb just because it has that extra flavor that the herbs bring to the soup.  I like eating this as a soup and use it in many casseroles and other dishes.
1;Tastes like an old boot;Even adding other fruit to this product doesn't make it taste any better.  I was hoping it would.
4;SunMaid Pitted Prunes.;I like these pitted prunes for breakfast in the morning, they are good with cereal and are high in fiber. I have always liked SunMaid products and I  like these prunes.
5;I love these bars!;My favorite is the cherry pie. Strong flavor? Yes and that's a good thing--very tart and satisfying.
5;Very nice taste;When we got our Keurig coffee-maker, I was excited to try new coffees.  Most are way too strong for me.
3;Not such a dragon;We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.
5;Kittehs love it, consistent quality;When my vet said to switch my cats from dry to wet food (for health reasons, potentially teeth reasons) I researched healthy cat food and really decided Science Diet was the way to go.  I tried all kinds of flavors, but my cats love this one.
5;Wonderful gold food paint;I don't have an airbrush, but I used it to paint on the fondant with a brush. It did a great job, will be buying other colours.
1;These things suck!;Good idea but sadly the product does not deliver. The bag is hard to open without burning your fingers or making a mess and most times the popcorn in the middle of the bag is burnt.
4;Gift Worthy Box of Cookies;The Presidor Allegro Crispy Cookies with Hazelnut Filling are a tasty, crunchy treat with kind of a dry center.  When I see filling, I think of creamy filling, but this was more of a dried Hazelnut paste.
5;Tasty Breakfast Cereal;This has a hint of brown sugar. Holds up well under milk and keeps its crunch until the last bite.
5;Makes for Happy Doggies;I highly recommend Hi-Tek Naturals!  Originally, I thought that my foster Great Dane was a picky eater, then started feeding him this food.  Now he leaps around like a puppy when the kibble hits the dish.
5;Excellent coffee - brings back memories of Bangalore;French Market is one of the best Chicory blended coffee that I have tasted in the US - really love the thick strong crema/decoction is makes.<br /><br />Anyone who has visited/grew up in South India - specifically Chennai/Madras and Bangalore - you would noticed that these are the 2 cities in India where coffee is a staple drink.
5;Great Soft Drink;This is one of the best soft drinks I have tasted in awhile. Why is it not in Grocery stores for easier access.
5;The Best Canned Cat Food;Wellness food is the best cat food to keep your cat healthy.  My cats love this flavor but any flavor would be a healthy choice for your cat.
5;My new favorite K-Cup!!!!!;This coffee rocks!! Not bitter and without that lingering aftertaste. I love the flavor of bold coffee and this one hits it perfectly.
5;Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 36-Count;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great substitute for named brands;Tired of carrying cases of soda around?  This is a great substitute and easier on the back.  When you follow the directions on how to make up a batch it was a great find.
5;Dark roast delight;I recently discovered this coffee on a trip to Canada, where it is $15.95 CA per pound.
3;Cheaper else where;I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.
5;vanilla disguise;Hidden behind the creamy vanilla flavor is a healthy organic list of veggies and fruit.  The protein curbs the urge to gag down junk food at work.
5;Great diet aid;I've been using coconut oil supplements to help my post-baby weight loss diet and I really feel like it's helped. Especially for those meals where my will power fails and my family is dying to eat out and I eat a little less than as healthy as I want.
4;Citrus flavor is nice....;These arrived quickly and were quite fresh. The individually wrapped fortune cookies were well sealed - each baggie around the cookie was full of air, protecting the cookie and its uniformity.
4;Very Tasty;I was looking for a hulless popcorn (due to my diverticulitis, boy do I miss popcorn) and tried this based on the reviews. I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME (the hulls do not disappear or get so small) but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing, very very tasty, my family loves it so I will buy it again.
2;Poor texture;Sure, its good for you but that does not make up for the taste and texture.  Other Kashi cereals are much better.
1;Poor quality saffron;I normally do not write reviews, but I decided to write one in this case to help fellow buyers. We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron.
5;smiles;Smiles..
1;i wasn't;I have  a shih tzu Chihuahua mix and he will not eat these. I was surprised since they got great reviews.
3;Not worth of price;This cliff bar is much more expensive than the nature valley products. But, it is not worth to be pricey.
4;Good taste but a close best before date;These crackers taste very good. The only problem is I ordered it in mid Oct 2011 and it says on the package that the best before date is 02JAN2012.
5;Better than Donut Shop!;Until I tried Vienna Coffee House, Donut Shop was the one I had on automatic monthly delivery.  Vienna Coffee House is a tad bolder than Donut Shop but very smooth without any bitterness.
5;Delicious tea, superb flavor;I love tea.  That said, there are definitely some teas that are better than others.
4;Senseo coffee;Everything to do with the order of Senseo coffee pods went as expected.  The order was filled in a timley manner, product quantities were correct and order arrived as expected.
1;I wish they tasted like Grilled Cheese;"I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.<br /><br />I thought I found the right product with ""Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff""."
1;Price too high!!!;This product sells for $4.69 in New York City, the Bronx  and in<br />South Jersey (in Shoprite) for $4.
2;Threw it Out!;"I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers on this product. When I read them, I thought ""well, maybe they're just using too much""."
5;Great taste, Great Results;This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results.  This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake.
5;starbucks Verona;Verona is by far the best coffee made by Starbucks. Buying in bean form it has much more flavor than if bought already ground.
5;Tasty Treats;I have searched the world over to find a healthy, tasty treat for my picky Papillon and Pom. These treats are perfect in size.
5;Grove Square Cider Cups Keurig K-Cup;"Delicious apple flavor, low calorie drink. Love these for a ""cup at a time"" treat."
5;good coffee;good product and very delicious.  reasonably priced but could be better.
5;Great cereal;"We discovered this cereal a few years ago at Trader Joe's.  We love it as an ""amendment"" to granola or Great Grains cereals."
5;Great granola bar!;I absolutely love these bars. Like the other review said it is gluten and dairy free which is hard to find these types of food that actually taste good! They may be a little high in fat and calories but they fill me up most days.
3;very functional but too flimsy to last;Got 3 of these to salve my recycle conscience and save on cost. I have the smallest of the Keurigs and drink 2 cups a day, so I figured I could keep 2 clean.
5;Senseo Coffee Pods;I have been enjoying Senseo coffee for many years.<br /><br />I appreciate being able to purchase it through Amazon and am pleased with the promptness of the delivery.
4;Healthy food for my 60 ferals;One of the hardest things about doing a TNR program is affordable feeding.I shop sales and use what is less expensive.
5;The Only Protein Powder That I Can Drink!;I have tried about 10 different protein powder mixes and finally came across CLICK.  I first ordered a sample pack of it and fell in love!!!  It is the best tasting protein drink out there.
5;Very good tea!;The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.
3;yummy;These arrived securely-packaged in clear plastic bags, unbroken and with the chocolate coating fresh and delicious. Tha almonds taste fine as well, not stale or so-so.
5;COFFEE!;Jet Fuel. And that it is.
5;Quinoa flakes in muffins;Love these! They are great in a muffin and good as a breakfast cereal. I also like that they are quick and easy to make.
4;A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...;We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).
5;I Have Spoken.;All of the chocolate arrived with out melting an not broken in peices. The taste is supreme and melts just right.
5;Delicious.;Great stuff, and a great price.  Very tasty, and no wacky ingredients.
5;Tasty treat;Easy to make and delicious to taste. I have the other Lipton instant teas.
3;Could have been better.;This product seemed to lose some of its flavor after awhile.  I used it infrequently in baking.
4;Good Value, but not Kona;I purchased this coffee after not being able to get any Kona Blend K-Cups.  It wasn't really my first choice, but I am fairly pleased with the purchase.
5;Love this stuff!;I've had 'em all, Davinci, Monin..
2;garlic seasoning;It doesn't have that much garlic flavor. More like salt and pepper.
5;Delicious Ginger Snaps!;"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps so when I tried Newman's Organic Ginger Snaps I was pleasantly surprised at how good they taste!  They are also crunchy which give them the extra ""Snap"" (and they are a perfect compliment to coffee or tea!).  The flavor is distinctly ginger like but not too sharp and not too sweet."
5;Energy;Nom Nom Nom..
5;Can't Get Enough;Great coffee not too strong. I got some not expecting much but after trying it I am hooked.
1;They call it a dip!;What are you supposed to dip into this, bread, toast, chips, all those caloric things? The regular Fluff is delicious and you can eat it by the spoonfuls, and it has few calories. This one, well, I don't know what it is.
5;Great for Schnauzer's allergies;We have a one year old miniature schnauzer that has had allergy problems.  She was rubbing her eyes a lot and constantly licking her paws.
4;pricing;This has a wonderfully mild flavor.  However,<br />$38.
1;Not fit for a dog;I threw this out.  It can't be deemed food.
5;Pouch;It is excellent for kids and adults too because there is only fruits.<br />Easy to take for sport for example.
4;Kind chocolat;kind bar satisfy's the chocolate craving and also has antioxidants.  Great as a breakfast bar and also tastes good.
2;I liked it at first...;The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it.
5;Wow- my dog eats this;I have never reviewed anything before - BUT - my dog will not eat dog food - I have tried everything - of course there is a long story about why he won't - but the fact is I cannot get him to eat dog food anymore.  This however - he eats immediately when I put it down for him.
4;I like a lot of these flavors!  Very convenient;I purchased this as a way to taste all the numi teas a few times and really get a feel for what I wanted to buy as a loose leaf bag.  I wish there was a chai included, but the variety is very nice.
5;Simplebites ginger snaps;These are the best G-F ginger snaps we've tried, and we've tried several different brands.  You can't even tell they're G-F.
5;not Bad;If you looking for this to taste just like the real thing it doesn't, its a bit sweeter, but if your looking to add peanut butter back into your diet without all that added fat this will work.<br /><br />I don't diet I change the way I eat and I have found that one can get use to anything if you give it a fair chance.
4;Good Product- but dusty casing;Received the product on time with no damage. Only issue we had was the outer canister looked unclean.
5;Excellent;Great tasting, perfectly strong but not bitter. My new favorite!  Tried many others.
3;I like it;Well, I like it.  Everyone is different.
5;delish;"I'm always a little wary of ""health"" food since a lot just doesn't taste good (at least, in my opinion), but these Cinnamon Oat Clusters were fantastic.  I snacked on them plain, but also ate them like cereal."
5;Amazing Product!;The only way I can compare this body wash is with another Dove product: the Exfoliating Body Wash. They are both great and refreshing.
5;Time for Tea!;I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.
5;Addicted;Ok. If you don't want to get addicted, don't try Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store.
5;Loving hot chocolate in Denver;The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.
5;Haven't looked back...;After my Dalmatian had luxating patella surgery my veterinarian recommended that we add Dasuquin Soft Chews to her diet, and we haven't looked back since. Her leg healed amazingly well, and there hasn't been any issues since.
4;surprisingly is what you would hope it would be;I just wanted to say I was a little weary because I love peanut butter so much, but this is what it claims to be.  I'll admit that I won't be adding water and making sandwiches or even dipping veggies into it, but for smoothies and various deserts or adding a peanut butter flavor to something else - yeah - this is awesome.
3;Taste is individual;I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.
3;Clear, Cool, Water?;When I was growing up, we would visit my grandparents in the summer. They had a place in town, but also had a cabin up in the mountains that we'd stay at on occasion.
4;Great taste, not too sweet - but stains everything!;We are huge CL drinkers and love how this tastes but it stains EVERYTHING - fingers, pitchers, counters. If you can be very careful and/or don't mind red everywhere definitely try this out - its great and fruity without being too sweet or to 'fake' tasting.
5;Absolutely great!;Here's a real winning combination - good old Raisin Bran and now some almonds - and the raisins are cinnamon-coated.  Pour on some Almond Milk and it is so good, you won't want to eat anything else!  I usually add a banana as well.
5;Best chicken flavor in a condensed product;The manufacturer describes this better than I can. I've been using their products for years with fantastic results.
5;A wonderful surprise in St. Martin;We just had this at Pedro's on Orient Beach in St. Martin.
5;The best instant Mac;My kids and I all agree - this is one of the best instant mac-n-cheese products out there. Definitely better than Kraft brands in taste and of course quality of ingredients (not to mention having a fair bit more in the box).
5;Perfect!;Came quickly and was just what we expected. Great job having a product that most everyone else on the web was out of.
5;Great taste;Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.
5;my favorite work snack;I love Kind bars, especially the almond/apricot variety. They're whole foods-mostly just dried fruit and nuts- & taste great.
5;Best Tea Ever!;"I would have never thought this would be a good combination but after having a chilled ""green tea sweetened with mint and honey"" I was on the hunt for the perfect green tea with mint combination.  I work in a coffee and tea shop and none of the teas we sell came close to what I was looking for."
5;Mixes well even in cold liquids;For those wondering if these would work in cold water, YES these will mix fine. I believe the iced via version simply includes sugar.
1;Is anyone else sick of this company?;My Shih Tzu has enjoyed these treats for years.  I used to give them 5 starts.
5;Best crackers ever!;These things are addicting and low in calories and fat too.  I love the Wasabi flavor.
5;Quality flavor for decaf;"It's hard to find a decaf English breakfast that has decent flavor.  Some of the supposedly ""naturally decaffeinated"" ones I've bought have either no flavor or have an unwelcome aftertaste."
4;Great popcorn;The popcorn is good.  I don't like the three pouch package.
5;Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!;We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch.
2;Just ok;I like the Tortuga original better than this cake. First of all the rum is cooked with butter and other ingredients, depending on how you like to make it, and made into a glaze.
5;YUMMY!;YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.
5;One of the upper tier Belgian ales on the market - 4.5 stars;With the exception of perhaps Stella Artois (which I don't honestly consider to be a true Belgian beer), Duvel is arguably the most well know Belgian beer in the States.  It's a very good golden ale
4;Beaba freezer tray: nice but gets a freezer burn;We got 4 of them to store food for my son. They work nicely in general, but we have several complains:<br />1) food gets a freezer burn unless you put the train in a freezer bag<br />2) the food that gets takes a while to blend (like broccoli) and gets a bit of air blended in is harder to get out of the tray.
5;Pregnant lady craving tuna fish;During both of my pregnancies I craved tuna voraciously.  I like that this is lower in mercury and contains all its natural fats.
5;Entertaining too!!;We have used and loved Altoids for years.  I'm not sure how long the little 'sayings' have been on the inside paper wrap, but I get a kick out of every one I've read so far!  Clever and funny .
1;Spiders;I found 2 spiders in my babies formula and was disgusted so I had to write this review.  Now I am stuck with three giant cans of this formula and am not going to chance my babies health by trying it again.
4;good syrups;These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties.
5;Baby Taz Loves 'Em!;Our pups are spoiled rotten.  When ever they've done something good, they expect a 'cookie'.
4;Cinnamon almond flavor makes old bran favorite new.;"I have always liked Bran flakes, so I was a little hesitant to try this ""new"" version of Rasin Bran. I turned out to be pleasantly surprised to find that adding the cinnamon and almond made this cereal taste great."
1;seem old, not worth it;Bought this thinking it cheap and more convenient, but i was wrong. The meat in the package seem dried and old.
5;My favorite baking flour;I love to cook and bake, and I experiment with a lot of kinds of flours. This is my standard though whenever I'm working on a new recipe.
3;Not BAD, may need to be combined with something;I got it today and tasted it right away. I just mixed up a heaping teaspoon with some hot water left over from making tea.
4;Servings Per Bottle = Greater Than One, Apparently;This New England winter is brutal. The winds keep howling, the temps keep dropping and the snow is pounding us like we owe the clouds money.
5;Lucy loves this food!;Decent price - dog eats this food like she's never eaten before in her life.  It can be hard to find this type in stores.
4;My Lab loves them.;THE GOOD:  My Lab loves these.  They are slivers not the whole ear which is easier for my old dog to chew on.
4;A NEW BRAND FOR ME;I admit it, I had never heard of this brand of cat food before trying this. I was dubious to the hilt for I have a 16 year old cat that puts a new meaning to the term finicky feline!! I cannot tell you how many times I have put food in front of her only to have her walk away.
5;Helped my sick cat take his medicine.;My cat has been having some health problems, and I have to make sure he eats so he can take his medicine.  After spending the day at the vets, he had no interest in food.
5;Awesome dark chocolate!;This is one great dark chocolate bar!  It is organic and when comparing this to a nestle special dark I can definitely tell the difference.  The Hershey's tastes more sugary and artificial.
5;Lipton Rasberry Tea, sweetened;This product is so popular that both of my local grocery stores, Winn-Dixie and Breaux Mart, cannot keep it on the shelves.  It is cheaper for me to buy through Amazon than to use up my gas to go to different grocery stores to see if they have it on the shelf.
5;Baby Mum Crackers;These are the best crackers for little ones!! They don't make a mess at all like the teething biscuits!  My baby girl loves them.  Our local store has been out of them for almost 2 months.
5;Fantastic crema!;I get rave reviews from everybody who has a cup of my Lavazza.  I have a built in Miele machine that loves these beans and produces a fantastic, deeply flavored, highly aromatic coffee with a rich crema topping.
5;Love It!;Patak's Mango Relish is my favorite to add to Indian foods. Open the jar, take a whiff and I salivate.
5;Very Berry Granola;This product is great for gluten free, or any allergy sensitive people.  It is filling and I use it for breakfast every morning.
2;Too salty and nearly expired.;I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.
5;Rich, full bodied, delicious!;I love my Keurig coffee makers. But most of the k-cups just aren't strong enough to give me the cup of Swedish style coffee I like.
5;My daughter loves these!;My daughter has food allergies and it is hard to find a bar that she can eat.  These are great tasting and healthy.
5;great!;"Our son is on a gluten free diet and Almond Flour is a daily staple.<br /><br />Pancakes,muffins,""breading"" for chicken & shrimp."
5;absolutely perfect!;I ordered a box of these on a whim when they were a Goldbox special a few days ago. The UPS guy delivered them an hour ago and I just got done eating 2 perfect pieces of perfection! The dark chocolate is excellent- a perfect complement to the peanut butter filling.
5;Bar Harbor Herring, Yum!;I was very please with the Bar Harbor Herring in Tomato Sauce. It had a great list of sustainable sources of ingredients and was very tasty.
5;Nothing Better;BBQ is my favorite flavor for all Popchips.<br /><br />Popchips are Healthy (as fas a a chip goes) and flavorful.
1;Awful;This stuff is nasty. The texture is like a mix of jello and pudding and the taste as others have said is chemical.
5;One of my favorite snacks;I love these snacks!  Great variety of flavors all mixed into one bag.  I also send them to our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and they ship so much better than chips.
4;Salty but filling;My husband will not make more of an effort to feed himself than to heat something up and if I'm not around to provide for him or leave him something already made in the fridge, his immediate go-to is canned soups and canned pastas. As such, I thought these Hormel meals would be a brilliant thing to have around the house.
5;unbeatable quality;"i was a skeptic of this product when i first met the rep in my pet store a few years back because they'll tell you anything to push a sale. ""human grade this"", ""super-luxe that"", and so on."
5;Anna's cookies;I totally love these cookies , BUT  the cookies are all crumbs.The cookies are all broken.
3;Two Bichons  comment...;I liked the packaging as the bag is resealable.<br /><br />The nuggets were softer than typical dry dog foods.
5;Very nice for the pantry;Sure, everybody knows about Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.  Want to try a great dip?  Throw one of these into a pint of sour cream.
4;Like Louisiana Better;I had been buying The Louisiana Fish Fry Cobbler Mix and thought it was heavently. THEN, I saw The Calhoun Bend Mill Peach Cobbler Mix ADVERTIZED as the mix that Georgia uses for its Peach Festival.
5;Good stuff.;This reminds me of a hamburger helper,  and it's very good.  A little expensive compared to hamburger helper,  but still very good.
3;ehh;Not as vanilla-y as I had gotten used to with general mills, and more cappuccino-y.  Depends on what you are used to drinking, I guess.
5;Makes my hair super soft and shiny!;I love the consistently of this shampoo- It looks like the conditioner, creamy consistency..
5;sees candies;i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased . the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well.
5;Good Buy and Amazon really delivers;Bought this with Amazon's 2 day guaranteed shipping.  It was 9pm the second day, no show.
5;Quality Almonds;Great product and even better price considering almonds going for $8. @ pound and if you like to use for cooking and baking, well, could get crazy.
5;Better than Nutella;This product is has a slightly different texture than Nutella, it's thicker and a little less oily but it's made of better ingredients and I honestly prefer the taste. Plus, I love that it's not stored in a plastic jar.
5;Not all from California, but a hugh delicious assortment of goodies from nuts to chocolate to pretzels.;See my pics with ruler to show size. Came double boxed with packing to protect it.
2;I'll stick to domestic honeycomb;Maybe it's because of the geographic location (Greece), but I didn't care for this.  The honey actually smells quite bitter or acidic.
1;Trickle-Trickle Little Star;Timothy's Rainforest Espresso is great-tasting coffee
5;Not just for kids......these are tasty!;Ok, I have to say, the packaging did draw me in..
5;SOOOO GOOD!;I love this tea and can drink it just on its own, but I sometimes add agave,or honey and a little cinnamon..
5;Happy;I am so thankful Amazon was able to get this cocoa for me.  They don't care this Nestle Product in any sotre from Michigan to Florida.
5;Just for the record...;Amid all the horror stories and bad experiences with this product that several other people have unfortunately had, I would like to write my own review. Vita Coco is my favorite brand of coconut water and I have been drinking it for a couple years now, and I recently decided to try ordering by the case here at Amazon instead of hunting down the odd carton or two at stores across my city (it's not that easy to find in San Antonio!) like I had been doing before.
5;Awesome Food!;My dog LOVES this food. I bought it because I was looking for something closer to a raw diet.
4;still tasty;These are 60% juice, because they are sweetened with water and a natural sweetener. Still tasty, and I like the little bottle sizes.
5;Six cats can't be wrong;All of my cats adore these treats. One cat in particular nags me constantly to feed him some and if I don't give him enough, he jumps up beside me and pokes me repeatedly with one claw.
1;underwhelmed;Not that it is an earth-shattering mistake, but instead of receiving what I ordered (chocolate gummy bears) I received a bag of chocolate coffee beans. Not really worth my time to go through the return process and mistakes do happen.
5;Worth Every Penny;Excellent bulk product. Very little packaging and good price.
5;Super Yummy!;I love These!  on a 50 calorie rice cake..
5;Great as a baby shower party favor!;Exactly what I wanted..
5;Finally....The one!;If you are looking for a thirst quenching drink with no artificial sweetners..
2;Fair to midland;I was skeptical about ordering what with the trouble of the cups exploding, but I didn't have any of that trouble. I did find, however, that it just wasn't full-bodied enough for me.
4;Quite yummy!;My son says this is the best cocoa he's ever had, and I have to admit it's dashed yummy.  But, there are also very good cocoas in foil packets in the supermarket which taste this good.
5;Not For Me;Everyone in my office loves these except for me.  It does not suit my taste.
5;Delicious Tea;I love this tea. It is delicious.
4;Ready to Eat Snack;The title for this product should not include 'Meal' but 'Snack' instead.  The combination of salmon and crackers, dried edamame, dried fruit, and chocolate toffee doesn't seem like much of a meal but several snacks put together.
5;A great deal;This was a great deal on one of the best tasting seasonings. I use it for so many dishes.
5;Its the only coffee I drink now.;"Two years ago I had an acid reflux ""event"" and was told to go on a low acid diet.<br /><br />I initially quit coffee, but I mean really, it turns out life is meaningless without my jolt so I found a solution in this coffee."
5;PERFECT FOR PIZZA!;Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza.
5;Delicious!  Why make it yourself!;Love this stuff!  Great at Thanksgiving or with your favorite roast chicken dish.  Just the right amount of spice!  Chunky style.
5;Great tasting organic pumpkin;When this item arrived, several cans were dented (during shipping I think). I contacted Amazon and they replaced the order.
5;So delicious!;So flavorful! I'm addicted. The best almost I've ever tasted.
4;tasty for a light dressing!;I love poppy seeds so I picked this up.  This dressing is light - it doesn't overpower the salad.
5;A great replacement for white sugar;We have completely replaced white sugar in our home, and Agave Nectar is one of the things we have used to do it.  We use it in baking (although this gets expensive, so sometimes we use organic evaporated cane sugar instead), for syrup (I don't buy or make syrup anymore), on PB&J's, on top of cold cereal or hot oatmeal, etc.
1;doesn't work!;i bought this for my dog so i wouldn't have to go search the entire backyard when it is clean up time..
4;Great Coffee;Very good coffee w/ a very nice flavor.  Not too bold, not too mild.
5;So good you could drink it!;Lawry's Mesquite Lime marinade is, in my opinion, the perfect addition to anything. Pork, beef, chicken, fish, and even veggies.
5;Perfect !!!!;Purchased for a wedding celebration..
5;excellent;what a refreshing treat.  I had heard of these from a relative in California who works at a spa, she said her women all loved them.
5;wonderful stuff;these have the best flavor, can use in water coffe or tea, love it..
5;Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix;I purchased this pack of 4 because the size is perfect for my husband to take to work. He loves this brand of cocoa with the rich milk chocolate taste.
5;Delish Glucerna Snack Bars for diabetics;This was a re-order from Amazon. These snack bars taste great and your blood glucose does not spike up after eating it.
4;My dog loves these - they help his teeth stay clean;"I originally started my dog with <a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Beware...;Crunchy balls of candy on the outside, chewy gummy in the inside.  Sounds clever, but these are mostly gross.
2;Very Disappointing!;These are small bite-sized nuggets of cereal with a chocolate center. I got them thinking it would be a good snack when I had a chocolate craving.
5;great value, great dog food;This is really good dog food and at a really good price. Way cheaper than at my local pet store.
2;Not what it seems;This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.
5;Yummy!;If you like Shortbread you will really like these. Walkers always makes the best Shortbread.
5;Cinnamon Granola Bars;I was very happy to receive this package. The Cinnamon Granola Bars are difficult to get in my area.
4;A great addition to the Mini-Wheats line;I am a huge fan of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, so when the maple & brown sugar flavor came out, I had to try it.  Yes, it's very good.
4;Add a little splenda and it taste great;This isn't the best cereal in the world, but if you are trying to eat high protein meals, then with milk you get about 20 grams of protein.  So it is the best for that.
5;Yum!;A great tea that got better because I can have it at bedtime!  I am a bit of a cheap snob when n it comes to EGT - I only like Stash, and this one is great.  The only one better is the double berg.
2;Too Much Sugar!;"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia."
5;Best of the bunch;My wife and I go through jalapeno slices like they're water (we eat a lot of nachos and also include these in most everything else we cook: huevos rancheros, meat loaf, etc., etc.
5;Delicious!;I decided to try these because the other brand was no longer available in some of the flavors we like. The reviews were excellent and I totally agree that these are delicious and crunchy.
5;Great lemonade;This stuff rocks. It's the best tasting lemonade drink mix you can buy.
5;Best Grocery Store Coffee I Have Tasted - No Joke;I used to be a super coffee snob - buying green coffee beans and roasting them at home.  It was tedious, but with a good espresso blend it would make one heck of a cup of joe.
4;Great morning tea;My Morning Mate is a mix of mate, black tea, and red rooibos. Listed under ingredients are sweet cocoa, chocolate and almond bits, pistachio nuts, macadamia nuts and coriander with warm hazelnut and cinnamon.
4;Great for dry mouth!;I'm a nurse and work with a lot of people suffering from dry-mouth. I bought these to carry around in my bag to hand out to my patients.
5;Works like magic for a novice;I'm not agriculturally proficient at all, and rather not deal w/ dead critters. But I just couldn't stand the backyard full of gopher hills, and wanted to give this a try.
1;the terrible ginger peach tea;This tea had a weird strong musty smell and taste that got in my nose and would not go away until the next day. I'm not kidding.
3;bit too strong;If you like bold, spicy flavored tea this is the tea for you. The cinnamon and orange flavor is robust and overpowering.
2;Just Plain Gross;I'm a notorious cereal addict, so I'll surely try anything once, especially if it's part of the Crunchy Nut line. I'm in love with the Honey Nut flakes version they came out with first recently in the U.
5;PERFECT PRODUCT FOR AN UNUSUAL PURPOSE;Like some other buyers, I found this product a perfect solution to my need, but not for the purpose that the manufacturer intended.  You see, I too have an aquarium for Tanganyikan cichlids - some of which are shell dwellers.
5;Benecol;Just got my blood work back and lowered it by 20 pts.  This is the only thing I have added to helping lower my cholesterol.
1;Made My Dog Sick;I've fed Zuke's treats for awhile (3+ years) but the last two bags gave my dogs horrible upset stomach.  I bought a massive bag too and had to throw them both away.
5;Hain Pure Foods Vegetarian Brown Gravy Mix;I bought this as a substitute to the gravy mix I did use (bought at Sams Club) that had monsodium glutenage (?) in it..
5;Excellent price, excellent product;Wonderful to find a mild tasting green tea that is also organic AND at such a fabulous price.<br /><br />Signed up for subscribe and save.
5;LOVE THEM!!!;One of these bars were sent to as a free sample.<br />I searched online for awhile to try to find the bars at a good price.
5;Quinoa? No Thanks!;I ordered the Arrowhead Mills Quinoa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) from Panache.  It arrived quickly, and it cooks up perfectly.
1;not what it represents itself to be;i was expecting real decafineated expresso.  Not instant coffee you use more to make your expresso.
4;spice tea;This tea is very good and I like the fact that it doesn't need sugar or<br />cream.  It isn't as great as some of the local restaurants' versions but<br />a good at-home solution.
5;Great Chips, too expensive on Amazon!;Love love love, these chips They are spicy and crunchy and perfect. But buy them straight from the Tims website you can get 6/8oz bags for the price of two on Amazon.
5;The best Mexican mocha powder;We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often.
5;Product Arrived Damaged Twice- UPDATE!!!;I had the same experience as another reviewer. I love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.
5;Great cookie--old Southern Recipe;My mother has given me these cookies for Christmas/New Years for decades.  They are crisp and delicious and I have never met anyone who hasn't liked them.
3;Taste is sour and good, but...;I had these once before and it was absolutely amazing, but the price is going up and up, and you kind of get tired of it eventually. It was pretty sour but ultimately it ends up becoming something you get tired of easily.
5;Great taste;I just got my coffee the other day. It taste as good as it sounds.
5;Love this when I'm sick;This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it.
5;Absolutely the best tea I've ever had;I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated.
2;Great nutrition, but my cat won't eat it.;"I really wanted my cat to like this food (especially considering how expensive it is), but she just doesn't want to eat it. I introduced the food to her by mixing it in with her old ""junk food"" dry kibble, as recommended."
5;Terrifc;I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics Dog Food. Natural, high is nutrition and with out fillers.
3;Okay, but too expensive;Flavor is so-so (not entirely worth the calories). Without the massive introductory discount, I would not buy this product from Amazon again.
5;High quality product & Extremely fast shipping;Very pleased with product and shipment.  Extremely fast shipper!  High quality seeds and great communication.
5;pure decadence;This is pure decadence sophisticated delight - i had no problems with the delivery either. One have to be into marzipan ,if you dont know  or tasted marzipan before , try it first on inexpensive kind .
5;Economic Natural Deodorizer;It works well even beyond the refrigerator and freezer. It's easy to use and is cheap.
5;Excellent taste and texture;The only other steel cut oats I've tried were Quaker.  They were OK but I think I like these better.
5;Best Bacon Tray;I use the Joie Piggy Bacon Tray every time I cook bacon.<br />It works best for cooking turkey bacon for about 3 minutes and it comes out crispy.
5;The Only Veggies My Daughter Will Eat!;A little expensive, but theses pouches are great on the go. They are BPA free and all organic.
4;Charms;Haven't opened them yet..
5;Really like diet cola and diet lemon lime.;The diet cola and diet lemon lime are great to me, but, sadly, I don't like the diet orange. I dearly love having the equivalent of so much weight (regular bottles and cans) in such a small bottle.
5;One of the Best Mild K-cups Made;I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.
5;Leafy Greens;Nature's Path Organic Hemp Plus Granola Cereal is more of a cereal than the usual granola. The hemp seeds add extra flavor to the cereal.
1;Great Taste - Hazardous Package;I guess you could say this is a good FOOD product, but you need to be very careful with this package. I bought mine at a local coffee house who offered to put water in it for me.
5;Can't believe it's instant!;"Quick and delicious. I'm somewhat of a coffee ""snob"" and this stuff tastes great."
5;Best potato chips ever invented;My fiancee and I discovered these chips at a Whole Foods in Denver last summer.<br />They are literally the best tasting potato chips I have ever had.
1;Used to love it....;Used to love it - but now I hate it.  Not only has the artificial sweeteners added an aftertaste but the texture is kinda slimy now - not enjoyable like it once was.
5;They like it;My 4.5 yr old female torti eats this happily
5;Wonderful for a natural snack for children;Love this bar. Taste great and no preservatives.
5;Definitely Happy;I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change.
1;Way Too Much Salt;Just after one bite, I could really tell there was way too much salt in the jerky.  After two bites, I simply couldn't eat more.
3;At least one bad-tasted piece inside each tins;The first tin, I got one piece that tasted like some soft wood. The 2nd tin, my wife got the same experience and had to spit it out fast.
5;Oh so virital flavorings;We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.
5;Cool stuff! Pretty presentation;This was a cool basket of goodies. I wasn't sure what to expect honestly.
5;'Gday mate!;My grandson craves salt. His father worries about too much salt intake.
4;Lipton Green Tea, Decaffeinated;This is a good alternative to caffeine.  I like the taste of it.
5;Good Tea;I'm not a tea-snob, so I won't pretend to know all about tea (or who has best out on the market, blah, blah, blah, ..
4;Very Rich and Dark;Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect.
5;Taste;Everyone that tastes these chips LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!! They all ask where they can get them.  Thank you for the email on when they were back in stock.
5;Good to mix with baby formula;My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.
5;great tasting;We used to live in Hawaii, and dearly missed the coffee made on the Islands.  This is a good tasting coffee.
3;Good but not great;This drink is tasty. Not too sweet.
5;The best hot mustard in the World!;This a delicious mustard with strong, wait very strong horseradish kick.  it takes sandwiches to a whole new level.
5;Classic Cookies;Walkers cookies have been around for a very long time.  I purchased them because I saw them listed and they were simgle serving.
2;Strong Branding, Weak Flavor;I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager.
5;Awesome treats for your dog!;Before my boyfriend and I went to get our eight month old Boston Terrier two weeks ago, we bought supplies we would need beforehand. We picked up Fruitables Pumpkin and Banana treats because they were cheap and sounded like simple, good treats (I check ingredients).
5;Another Bag, Please!;These Snappy Crisp salad peas are lght, crispy,tasty  and when I start, I have difficulty to stop eating a them.The saltiness is just right for balance in health and flavor.
5;Good Coffee Pods & Maker;The Senseo coffe pods work with are Black&Decker Home Cafe single cup maker. We Love both of them!!! The pods are getting hard to find in stores and are costly.
5;What can you say?  They're Cheez-Its;The title says it all.  Why would Amazon suggest I write a review.
4;Yummy! Will Buy Again!;This noodle bowl was delish! I'm Korean and loved the taste of it. Bummed that it is high in calories since it is considered 2 servings, but it is wonderful it doesn't have MSG (which gives me headaches).
5;Lo Cal Fix;If you like espresso with a side of sweet, try the 100 cans of illy issimo Cappuccino. If you like something bolder, try this.
3;Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice;I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her.
5;Tabasco soy sauce with a little zing;I need to buy some soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and teriyaki sauce. I noticed that Tabasco had a special deal on all 3 of these.
5;Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this;I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.
5;Delightful surprise;I've got a Keurig for my dorm room and I usually just buy a sampler box because I don't really have a preference for any one of the coffees. However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot.
5;Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 ounce jar;This coconut oil was great for eating raw and unheated or for cooking and sauteeing. I prefer its consistency and flavor to some of the other brands that I have tried.
5;CHOICE ORGANIC BANCHA TEA;do not hesitate to order this product.  i have been a columbian coffee drinker for 30 plus years.
3;K-cup;I found this decaff coffee just o.k.
3;Meat on the internet??;Back in my days you had to get to a store at 3 am and wait until they open so you can get food on your table. This was Poland 20 years ago.
5;Five Paw Salute !!;"My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from ""Human Grade"" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself."
4;Pretty good, a few shortcomings;Overall we are liking this product. The manual is horrible so there's definitely some trial and error and thinking you need to do to figure it out.
4;It sure is cat food.;I think it would be more appropriate for my cat to be reviewing this product. But since he's busy with creative endeavors, I suppose my opinion will have to do.
5;Awesome moisturizer;This is a phenomenal moisturizer! I've never been able to use face cream too often because the oils in them would make me break out. However, not wanting to look 70 years when I'm in my 30s I knew I had to find something that worked for me or my face was going to look like a prune.
5;Fantastic breakfast on the go-- healthy and tasty;Our morning routine isn't perfect-- sometimes our little one wakes up later and we end up rushing around trying to get the day started. These Plum Organics pouches are a lifesaver-- they are a yummy combination of protein, grains, and fruit.
3;Tasty but pricy;The salmon is pretty tasty.  A little on the salty side, but still good.
5;I Would Recommend These;These are very good sardines that have been very reasonably skinned and deboned (Gutted too). The price is good as well.
5;Game Changer;You are reading the review for a reason. The reviews speak for themselves.
5;Durable, works well--make sure to clean;This pump works well with the Monin syrup bottles.  Just make sure you clean it after using, since the dried syrup will clog the spout.
5;Great;My dog and I both love this product.  My vet even said it was great that my dog is having one every day.
5;Wonderful Flavor;These chips are wonderful. The BBQ and the Salt and Vinegar are both great.
5;My lab loved these treats.;My lab thought these were the greatest. It's basically chicken jerky for dogs - so a bit tough and they have to chew for awhile.
5;best coconut oil -- in GLASS jars!!;I bought this from their online site last year.  It's a wonderful product.
2;Goodbye, Chocolate Malt -- Hello, Malt Chocolate;"A long-time devotee, I don't expect to buy it again. After I tasted the ""new improved"" and found it much less flavorful than the old, I did a sniff test."
5;fight cholesterol in a very tasty way!;"We have been taking the Benecol ""Smart"" Chews twice a day with meals ever since they became available.  Based on our lab tests, they must be working -- and they have a""yummy"" taste!  They're not easy to find in stores."
4;Very good cup of coffee;"I am impressed with Mr Puck's different blends, this one is a favorite of ours. It lives up to the ""medium roast"" name, full bodied, not acidic and smells great while brewing, will buy again."
5;That's a lot of artichoke hearts!;Yes, there are a LOT of artichokes in each one of these cans.  More than can possibly be used it seems.
5;Salty Goodness;This stuff is awesome.  I sprinkled a tiny bit on some chicken and cooked it in a pan with just a little olive oil (nothing else!) and it tasted fantastic.
4;Surprisingly different peach tea;When I first received this tea, I was disappoined upon reading the ingredient label.  I wanted peach/apricot tea which is my most favorite tea flavor.
4;My Dog Loves It!  and it's 5 star rated;At this point, I actually can't say if the food is going to work out completely, but I can say that my dog definitely loves it. I've tried giving him choices and he always chooses the Earthborn.
5;A loyal drinker (!) for years;Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).
5;Great Stuff;It's the only olive oil we use.  We have food allergies and this is the most unadulterated one that we have found.
5;Best tasting pretzel snack;I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt.
5;Candy for kitties!;I have two cats, Tiger is 7-years old and the Dusty is 18-years old.  They both absolutely LOVE the Crunch Lovers tuna flavor!  And I love the canister - if Tiger finds the pouch, he opens it himself from the bottom and has a feast.
3;it can be better;My dad is a honey trader in his younger days and he know quite a bit about honey.  This honey does not taste great for being gather in the wild, according to him.
4;Lots of variety!;I was happily surprised when the package arrived 2 days after I placed the order. The K-cups were in a brown paper bag inside of a box no cups were damaged, all were in date! The variety was good with NO duplicates and it's an inexpensive way to try different flavors.
5;Finally a toy that lasts longer than a couple days!;My 8month pit mix just loves this toy and even though months later after he has eaten half of it, he still plays with it.  Im going to look for the next size up next time though.
5;as good as I remembered;I purchased my container of Atomic Fire Balls to share with others that may have not tried them.  They seem to be unavailable in this part of Texas.
5;5 Hour Energy Orange;great prices i order from here 2 times a month ..
5;great tasting!;wow the taste in this is great,very good flavor.very fresh tasting.
5;Definitely worth it!;I bought this product as a gift for my brother. It was delivered about 5 days later and he was amazed at the size of the gummy bear! It was chewy, but tasted better then regular mini gummy bears.
3;Garlic;I have tried other garlic products and they were so mild that you could not taste any garlic flavor. However, the garlic cloves from Delicias were better.
5;great;These are jumbo and flavored nicely,  I ended up saving $.40 per pack as well, good deal.
5;love it iced!;Such a great tea, glad to see it on Amazon since my local grocers don't carry it.  Totally agree with the other reviewers about how yummy it is.
5;Great cat treats;CET Chews for Cats ECONOMY (96 chews) Fish Flavor<br /><br />We originally tried the CET Chews for Cats (fish flavor) when a friend gave us a small bag. Our cats went nuts for these treats.
5;Wonderful coffee!;This is a great cup of hazelnut coffee
5;Charms Sweet & Sour Lollipops;These are the absolutely best suckers of all time..
5;Best of the best;Bear Naked is my favorite granola and Fruit and Nut is by far my favorite flavor.  I came across Bear Naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt.
1;Contains Chinese Meds For Thrombosis Cardiovascular Diseases!;I would not worry about the other ingredients everyone seems concerned about. but you should worry about this:<br /><br />Acesulfame K is 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) and has not been fully studied.
4;Puppy love's them!;My Australian Shepherd puppy loves these things! I was looking for chew treats made specifically for puppies, to avoid giving him something that would harm him, so I purchased these and have been giving them to him since he was about 8 weeks old. They keep him occupied for a solid 30 minutes or so, the only problem with them is that they leave an orangy trail on your carpet and, if your puppy is like mine and uses his paws to hold while he chews, they inevitably get it all over their paws too :-( It's not hard to wash out, just a pain and seems kind of silly to have a dog treat that bleeds orange everywhere if you have neutral colored carpet like me.
5;VERY VERY NICE STUFF;I became aware of this product after reading an article about bugs in food and watched the accompanying video that showed the moving critters on a strawberry.  Oh my.
5;It is magic!;My son's favorite food is fajitas and after trying every fajita seasoning at our local grocery store we just happened to come across Chef Paul's. Once we tried it, we loved it.
5;Outstanding super premium dog food!  The best in my opinion!  I couldn't be happier!;I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.
2;I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...;I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever.
5;A very fine Tea;This tea was very good. I was Very happy I got it.
3;Cheaper else where;I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.
4;Good product!;I admit, I haven't been using this as religiously as I had hoped, but so far, I am quite happy with this product.  The taste is very subtle, so if you like a stronger tea, you might want to add a small amount of sweetener.
1;Dog Food Recall;I have two dogs that eat this food.  Both got very sick off of it.
4;It's best as a slushy;I see the complaints about this stuff tasting bad, but we love it! The best way to drink it is by leaving it in the freezer for a couple of hours before drinking, it's slushy-like and tastes so good! It's a great source of potassium, magnesium, and Vitamin C for someone who may not get enough of these essentials in their daily regimens. Try it like this, I bet you'll like it better.
5;Lamb and beef stew;My 4 yr old poodle loves this mixture. The combination of chunks and gravy are very exciting to him.
5;This is a good addition to emergency supplies.;"If you have a ""bug out bag"" or just like keeping emergency supplies, this canned chese is worth considering. Also, it melts really well."
5;Great help for insomniacs;I purchased this to help my son relax in the evening to unwind from a busy school/activity day.  It works well and help him get back into a sleep cycle when necessary.
4;coffee pods;Coffee is very good.  Price is a little high but that is the case on most single serving coffee products.
5;So Delicious, So Easy!;Bring home a plain roasted chicken, make some Spanish rice and a green salad and you have a Gourmet meal, literally in minutes! Heat the sauce up and just spoon some over the chicken and serve.I love mole,but I don't love making it from scratch.
1;Moldy Brazil nuts;I received my two bags of Brazil Nuts and dove into the first bag. I had to stop myself, because after eating one I quickly realized it tasted like mold.
5;Cat Treats Supreme!;I have been buying Temptations for over a year and it is by far my cats favorite treats.  They line up at attention when they see me getting out the bag.
2;Everlasting? uhhhhhh NO;"These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word ""everlasting"" is what's making you consider buying.."
5;Great Coffee - Great Price - Real Satisfaction;This coffee is smooth, but if you add more it can pack a punch without being bitter.  I love the flavor - my absolute favorite.
5;Hot tea at work will not be the same!!;After many years I finally admitted to myself that I can't stand the taste of coffee, no matter how much I cream & sugar it up it still has a bitter taste I can't stand. So now I've been drinking hot tea for the past few years, trying many kinds, and liking it a lot especially with just a bit of honey.
5;Treats for dog training;Definitely great for dog training - if you want to have a well behaved dog then giving them treats helps them learn so easily - just like with kids..
2;Not enough pumpkin or spice!!!;I purchased Green Mountain Fair Trade Pumpkin Spice and was under the impression that since they were a bit on the pricy side the flavor would knock my socks off. Not even close.
4;Strong espresso flavor with a hint of milk;Strong espresso taste with a hint of mil, but a tiny bit bitter for me, yet not as much as the cappuccino flavor. If you like a little bitterness, then you'll prolly love this.
4;One of the best around!!!;This is BY-FAR one the best alternatives to canned tomato sauces (and it tastes great).  I've alerted my local supermarket to stock it.
5;Victor 0631 Mole Trap;Worked exactly as described.  Unit is well built and inexpensive.
5;Great product!;Great product!  I will reorder.  Be aware that it may take a little getting used to--it seems a little greasy.
5;Excellent Cookies;I have been in search of a healthy alternative for animal crackers. This product is the bomb!! they are so flavorful, and a perfect consistancy.
5;Delicious!;I wanted to cook something fun and easy this weekend for my friends and I, so I decided to take a chance and order this Curry Kit and wasn't disappointed.  Was able to prepare while talking, getting drinks, answering the door, etc.
4;Closest thing to Fresh Coconut Water!!!;We come from a tropical country where coconuts are in abundance. We have grown up drinking fresh coconut water knowing fully well its health benefits over all those carbonated, artificially flavored drinks that contain a lot of bad than good.
5;Using the tweezers;I had mixed results with the Pill Pockets until I read the hint in a review here to put the pill into the pocket with a tweezers and not have the odor of the pill on your hands. Once I started doing that, it was like magic.
5;Good stuff!!;Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.
4;solid tea;This is a solid tea, a good addition to a rotation of teas.  Good taste.
5;tasty and delicious;I purchased this item To use as wedding favors.  I was very impressed.
5;Amazingly delicious  and fresh tasting!;Even just on its own these crushed hemp seeds are phenomenal. I can understand how a 3# package can last quite a long time although I do use it to make milk in my soymilk maker http://www.
5;Yes, yes, yes!;Finally, a cereal that I can get my two year old to eat on a regular basis!  We just add milk and nuke it for 45 seconds and add a little applesauce as one other reviewer suggested and he usually gobbles it right down.  He's a very picky eater too.
5;Always fresh!;These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work.
1;Service was great;
4;Great Ginger-Peach for Cold Afternoons;"I've tried many varieties of ""ginger peach"" teas, and this is probably my second-favorite.  It's not got quite as much of the sweet peach flavor as I like."
5;good;The quality of the product was good. The cases came at the time they were scheduled to come.
5;GREAT, GREAT GREAT!!!;I love, love, LOVE this brand of protein bars..
5;travels well for birthday wishes;"I sent these to my sister for her birthday - they are her favorite brand of jelly beans. I was pleased that the individual ""cups"" of flavors stayed separate during shipping so she could pick her favorites."
1;Order from E-Pets Galore;Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J.
5;Bubba loves them;Bubba is on a medication for the rest of his life. Before I purchased Pill Pockets he would eat the cheese, hot dog, or peanut butter around the medication and spit the pill out.
5;Delicious Spicy and best of all Easy!;So you're having company or want to impress a special person with a nice meal, if you're cooking-challenged like me this Rendang Curry makes a great impression. The box contains the sauce and spices that you will need.
5;Great quality;Love this bag! Perfect size. I've been using it to make a 1/2 gallon of fresh almond milk every 2-3 days for the last 6 weeks and it works great.
4;Should be called Natural Drano;I take this in the evening to help wind down, but feel its effects more in the morning when I ease into the cringing porcelain throne. I appreciate its nutritional value but would like to feel a bit more of the calm and a bit less of the avalanche.
2;These are not organic;While Earth's Best produces great organic products for kids, these use some but not all organic ingredients. All Earth's Best products that are organic will have that word below their logo, this does not.
5;my baby is happy!;a bit runny but baby loves it! I can add a little oatmeal to thicken it. It is very sweet.
4;Very good cup of coffee;"I am impressed with Mr Puck's different blends, this one is a favorite of ours. It lives up to the ""medium roast"" name, full bodied, not acidic and smells great while brewing, will buy again."
5;Wow!  Good!;The orange is real orange taste, great combination.  The best of the Chimes ginger chews.
2;Cocoanut Concentrate;Did not taste at all like coco waters. Would have sent back but did not wnat to pay the extra shipping.
5;Love, Love, Love Barney Butter;Unlike many Almond Butter reviewers, I'm not much of a fan of peanut butter. I love almonds, know that they are good for us, and thought I'd try BB to see if I'd enjoy having it with celery sticks and/or crackers.
5;Love this Popcorn;I just LOVE this Popcorn.  It's the only one I can find with NO BUTTER.
4;Not bad!;With all the hoopla, I decided to give this a try, without any great expectations. I was expecting this to be very bland, but surprisingly it wasn't.
5;Stash Green Tea;I bought this tea for my husband because he loves tea..
1;Awful;This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.
5;Great!;This is REALLY good peanut butter.  I've been buying a different name brand forever.
5;Stash Premium Gunpowder Green Tea, Loose Leaf;This is a high quality green tea from Stash that makes some excellent tea.<br /><br />The first time I made the tea, I steeped it for a little too long, so there was some bitterness.
1;Very disappointed;Was very disappointed to find that this product has high fructose corn syrup in it.  I don't know if this is common for all icing colors or not but I guess I figured since it was Kosher that maybe it wouldn't have those type of ingredients.
5;Great Taste;If you like a strong taste in your coffee Dark Magic is for you.  i ordered 1 box and will be ordering it again.
5;don't leave off holiday list;This was a great ham & all my guest wanted to know where I purchased it.I now will get it for other occasions also, not just christmas.
5;2 paws up;"My dog absolutely loves these. My only complaint is that they're a little pricey, but it's worth it for an occasional big ""treat""."
5;Great service;I received the tea very fast.  It is a delightful tea and I sleep so well after having it near bedtime.
4;Boat load of Pad Thai;This is an awesome sauce, for a quick dish of pad thai for two (per packet).  My family loves when I make pad Thai with all the fixings.
1;EWWWWWWWW!!!!;Worst pasta sauce..
5;Excellent Taste & No Sugar;I use to buy this at health food stores and some supermarkets at a higher cost of course. This granola has an excellent and tangy flavor, is filling, and as I said has no sugar of any kind.
5;Flower foods;I purchased Monin's Violet syrup last winter, when I wanted to make classic cocktails and Creme de Violette liqueur was not yet widely available. It made a delicious, if slightly too-sweet Aviation cocktail.
5;"Replace the ""black cup of coffee""";"I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8"". For a good part of my college years I was 220-250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink)."
5;A Hair Miracle!;I've been natural for almost a year now and its hard to find a product that could really add moisture to my hair while killing my dandruff problem.  I was hesitate at first after seeing a friend use it on his hair (He's Spanish so it works with different hair types)I thought his hair took well to the product because of the completely different texture, but I tried it anyway.
4;Scorpion Sucker;"This was a star for our ""Fear Factor"" activity.  The participants liked the flavor and the scorpion provided the adrenaline rush."
4;korea instant noodle;one of my favorite instant noodles.  the noodle itself was okay but love the saurce package - so spicy and tasty and it comes in large quantity.
5;Fab Treats!;Drakes yodels are simply the best.Substitutes just don't cut it.
4;Pleasantly Surprised (original flavor amazing meal);I ordered this after comparing other natural brands such as Vega as a morning and or after workout shake. Although I am still curious about VEGA, I am very pleased that I chose this product instead.
5;The best food for every baby!;I had a tough time introducing (semi)solid foods to my baby boy who was exclusively breast fed until 9 months. Thats when we tried Earth's best fruit starter pack.
4;Easy to use - could use better labeling;These packets are easy to use.  Loved that.
4;Not Too Bitter, Not Too Sweet--Just Right;For a quick pick-me-up, grab a Special K granola bar in dark chocolate. With only 110 calories per bar, this chewy treat offers a rich taste and will appeal to those who savor dark chocolate.
5;Nothing else like it!;I've tried just about every flavor out there that i can find of Izze Sparkling soda and I've loved every sip of it. Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water.
1;Terrible;I bought this popcorn without reading the ingredients.  I never would have guessed that it would contain artificial sweetener.
5;Fantastic, Love the Larger Bottles;I love this coconut water, (I also purchase VitaCoco cases at least 1-2 times a month). This coconut water is my husband's favorite, so we always have it in the refrigerator.
5;delicious specialty dish mushrooms;I have found consistently high quality in almost every Roland product I've ordered over the years, with very few exceptions.<br /><br />I ordered these straw mushrooms to make Thai Tom Yum soup but use them in miscellaneous stir fry dishes also.
4;Best Shredded Wheat biscuit on the market;I was drawn to this product because it contains zero amounts of sugar but the fiber count is just right too. The texture and taste are heartier than other shredded wheat products you may find down at your local Wally World.
5;This product is the BALLS!!!!!;I haven't received it. I don't give a crap if it tastes like donkey piss.
1;Defective K-Cups from Timothy's;I LOVE Timothy's Colombian Decaf. It is the best tasting Decaf out there.
5;Use this as a Base to Get Creative!;I used this mix as a base to make Tuscan Chicken Alfredo like they serve at that wonderful Italian Restaurant that we all know and love (but can't mention here). I used 2 boxes (preparing according to package directions) and added about 1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes, 1/4 cup chopped roasted garlic cloves (from the deli - already roasted), 1/4 cup chopped canned roasted red pepper (or pimento) and a 12 oz.
5;Green UM Treats;My dog loves these and they work great while training since I use positive training methods. I have a Pit Bull and these treats have made training very easy.
5;Zatarains King Creole;This is another good Zatarain's Cajun base. The grocers in my area don't offer this one, SO.
5;Very tasty gingerbread cookie;Even though all the cookie mixes are fantastic, I would say that gingerbread cookie is my favorite!  You can really taste the flavor of the ginger..
5;Perfect potato chips!;I've been a fan of kettle chips for over 20 years--and have always remained loyal to the original Kettle brand.  I've sampled many other brands but never found one I liked as well.
5;Amazing service.;I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.
5;A great deal;I recently started drinking loose tea instead of bags. I was buying the jars from my health food store, but they are pretty expensive.
5;Best protein I've had;This is my absolute favorite protein mix. I mix one scoop with 8oz of really cold milk and just sit back and enjoy.
3;Good Florescent Value;This is a good florescent value, but you can not dim these bulbs.  They come on quickly, light is cool.
5;Eight O'clock Coffee Beans;This is the only coffee I will drink. I was buying it at WalMart but for a brief time they quit carring it.
1;My dog spit these out!;I have a 10 month old Goldendoodle who eats everything. She spit these out and walked away! I am so disappointed!  Wish she loved them because the price is right.
5;Mild and Pleasant.;A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow.
5;Very good and prompt service;I had a problem finding these sugar-free products locally for awhile and ordered them from Amazon.  The order was quick and I had no problems.
5;Love, love, love this coffee;I was searching for coffee for my husband when I stumbled across this brand.  After reading all the great reviews I decided to purchase and give it a try.
5;Where have all the marshmellows gone?;I loved nestles diet (low cal) hot chocolate with marshmellows. It was only 30 or 35 calories.
5;Rogers Kcups;I find this brand of k-cup to be eco friendly and great tasting.  There are a number of brands to choose from and they are all fairly priced.
5;Celestial Seasoning Sleepytime tea;Sleep has long been a problem for me - it took many tries before I found a medication that works - however, if I took a quarter of a tablet if I needed to take a nap during the day, I would wake feeling very tired.<br /><br />I recently decided to cut back on caffeinated drinks and our favorite server at a restaurant we dine at often, suggested chamomile tea.
5;Perfect for cleaning teeth;I bought the large and should have gotten the x-large.  I have a 75 lb chocolate lab and 100 lb golden retriever.
5;Great tasting!;I love this chai! Better tasting than Trader Joe's, Oregon Chai and Tazo. I love the Vanilla version too! I discovered it a few years ago and stumbled upon it at a discount grocery store.
5;Much cheaper in bulk!;I love these apples but they were expensive in small amounts.  These were wonderful, we just kept them in the bag they were shipped in and closed it with a chip clip.
1;False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!;"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs."
5;Excellent Decaff!;Sams Club discontinued their decaff & we thought it was the end of the world.  This was such a fantastic bargain, we were a bit skeptical about the taste.
5;Happy Baby Organics - LOVE THEM!;My children love the happy baby organics. I just wish they had more of a selection on Amazon.
5;Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!;POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.
5;Eggs-actly as described.;Great product. Very versatile and useful especially for low carb eating.
4;Delicious favorite;Nice selection of flavors.<br /><br />blue - tastes like blue!<br />green with yellow center - sour apple<br />orange with white center - orange cream<br />white with black stripes - anise/licorice and it tastes good too!<br />white with red stripes - peppermint<br />red with red stripes - cinnamon<br />brown, white - chocolate vanilla<br />yellow, pink - strawberry banana<br />peach - peach (wow)<br />brown, white, pink - Neapolitan<br /><br />Six packs will last a long time.
5;Delicious;I don't have to tell you how good these things are, if you're looking at em, chances are youve had them.  I can honestly say these are the best I've had out of any other brand.
2;Not the Real Deal for Skyline Chili;This is definitely not the real deal for Skyline Chili.  I was very dissappointed with the end result.
3;A pretty good cereal with some room to improve.;So, I just picked up my first box of Peanut Butter Puffins. Overall, I'm satisfied.
4;VERY PLEASED!!;This is a great assortment and price..
5;We love it - safe rawhide that lasts!;This thing is HUGE and my Great Dane absolutely adores it! I purchased 2 chews, a knotted one and this braided one, and I must say that I am very happy. That's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide -- my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me.
5;Great product;I had the black spagueties for the first time in my trip to Merida last May at an Italian Restaurant and I liked them very much.  They prepared it with shrimp scampi.
3;Meh, I think I like Justin's better;I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.
5;Awesome Treats!!;both my 14 week old aussie and 60 lb cattle dog mix love them! perfect for training
4;Peppa Dew Stuff;I bought some peppadew peppers online.  Service was great.
5;a Preferred Treat for Feline Americans;This does not work well as a 'cat treat' where you toss one and the cat runs after it.  Those are much smaller, moist or dry, and they have greater cohesion.
5;Delicioius and easy to prepare;These are great to keep in the freezer.  A little peppery, but not too much.
5;Super Yummy;I love these chips! They are lower in fat but better in taste that most other chips. The price is right too at the case price.
4;Pretty good, one small tweak and it would be great.;"For some reason when I ordered this I thought I was getting a case and not just one can.  Reading is fundamental right? :-) Anyway, I loved the watermelon-strawberry taste but I didn't expect it to be so ""carbonated""."
1;What!!!!;These are super delicious!  But can be found at your local grocer for approx. $2.
5;Tasty & Healthy;I googled the best way to cook this and a few sites suggest soaking to avoid possible bitterness. After rinsing & soaking for 15 mins I cooked a cup w/ 2/3 water to sample and take for breakfast the next day if I enjoyed the taste.
5;four paws up!!!!!;With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program.
5;BEST Noodles;Use to Love these noodles when i was a kid and just remembered them and had to buy some. They taste just like i remember if not better, Best package noodles ever.
3;Good but could be better.;"Overall this brand is good but I think it is lacking in ""spicyness"" as they don't seem spicy at all. I don't , not like them but I just wish they had more ""sweet spicy"" flavor instead of more sweet."
5;great product;I was delighted to find this product.  It offered just the delicious new taste I was craving and it is so easy to prepare.
4;Maypo Instant Maple Oatmeal;purchased for alternative cooked cereal for elderly mom.  Now, also for myself with pending multiple uppper teeth extractions (ready for the fake chompers here).
5;Savoring the food grade shellac wax;"Anyone who's read my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Energy Gel Review;I'm an avid marathoner so I'm accustomed to fueling on the go.  I've used both Power Bar and Gu brand gels and have never noticed a difference between them.
5;Sweet Soy.....I'll Never Be Without You Again !!;I ordered this after trying some sweet soy sauce in an asian restaurant, the shipping was very fast, and it was packed securely. These bottles are a generous size, and I am well-stocked now.
5;Her Favorite Treat;My Havanese puppy (5 mos old) loves these treats.  We have used them for potty training.
4;Sweet Deal on Cacao;This Cacao powder is really the best deal you will find. It is not phenomenal in taste but its still really good.
5;Works perfect!;This product works just as advertised!! Guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. A-HOLES haha.
3;Too Hot;I love toothpicks, especially cinnamon flavored ones, but these are way too hot.  The Thursday Plantation Cinnamon picks are much better in my opinion.
5;Easy to use and tastes great!;I just bought the DeLonghi home espresso maker from Amazon and purchased these pods plus starbucks flavored syrups.  The quality is amazing!  I can make the same latte at home at a fraction of the price.
4;Chocolate Almond Bark;The almonds and the dark chocolate were excellent.  Unfortunately, in shipment the almonds must have been on a heat source that melted them into one giant patty.
5;Great for a french press;I keep on enjoying more blends from Raven's Brew, and this one does not disappoint. A very nice flavor, smooth as always and a lot of complexity go a long way.
3;Very potent stuff!;The color of this drink is a dark golden yellow, and the smell is of very potent ginger.  I was hopeful that it would bring the spice that ginger naturally has, and it sure did.
4;bannana bread;This made GREAT bannana bread - added a few mini choc chips and could even get my kids to eat this bread. I did not like the bits of almond in it - but just sift them out.
5;The Best coffee ever!;This coffee is amazing! I am a ten sugar kind of guy with any coffee, but one day I took a sip of my wife coffee with no sugar and I was hooked. I am not saying it is sweet it is just a perfect flavor.
3;Too Hot For Me - I'm a wimp;OK, I'll admit it, label me a wimp. No, I could not eat one of these beans.
5;My Yorkie Loves These Treats!;I purchased these treats because they were on sale, but also because they're made in the US with safe ingredients.  My Yorkie loves duck breast jerky, but those treats are made in China, and I'm not sure I trust products from there 100% after the poisonous ingredients that were found in China-made dog food in the recent past.
5;Wish this was at a store;I grew up with this stuff (used to be in a gold can). I use this alot and not just for popcorn or Baked Macaroni.
5;slick shopper;I found that my grocery store stopped carrying this item when i went back for more. this was an easy and less expensive way to replenish my stock.
4;Yummy....without the harmful ingredients!;This gum is the best out there that I have found without harmful ingredients such as aspartame, HFCS, food colorings, etc. Almost all other gums contain aspartame which - if consumed over a long period of time - has been closely linked to cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders and birth defects.
5;Cats love it;After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.
5;Delicious!;These baked chips have a great crunch. Best baked chips I've had to date.
5;Good for urinary tract;One of my cats has had urinary tract infections & once tested positive for struvite crystals. This food has cranberries in it which is good for urinary tract health.
5;Just as promised;The problem with incorrect package size has been corrected. I ordered this from Amazon, and received the correct 11 lb bag, fresh and well packed - just as promised.
4;3.5 out of 4 Paws;First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty, but I still loved them.
4;Surprised;I didn't give it 5 stars just because it is rare that I would do that but honestly there is nothing wrong with this stuff. Not to sweet, I personally add something to change that, but a great coffee taste.
5;Love As Iced Tea;I ordered this tea based on a reccommendation of my midwife during my summer pregnancy and regular swelling in the heat and humidty. It has a nice minty flavor when brewed.
5;Great!;Yummy, healthy fun snack.  Great whether you eat them right out of the bag or put them in cereal, yogurt whatever.
5;Nutricious, tasty, low cal;This is another very good soup from Progresso. For those used to Campbell's Cream of Tomato soup, this is a big change.
5;This stuff is great!;"I was sceptical, but this stuff is great. It not ""quite"" peanut butter, but it close enough."
5;Healthy and delicious!;If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose.
5;Brooklyn Bean Roastery Lover;I am the happy recipient of a NICE sized sampler box of the Vanilla Skyline coffee, which is absolutely delicious. The aroma that fills my kitchen while I am brewing it pales in comparison to the delicious flavor of taking that first sip.
4;Very good.;"My gf and I did a taste test of this, Kool-Aid Twists Ice Blue Raspberry Lemonade Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;I expected better;After reading the reviews I ordered a case and boy was I  disappointed.We tried both the thick and thin and both were equally as bad.
5;These cookies are to die for.;Since going gluten free, what I have missed the most is a good cookie.  The gluten free breads and cookies on the market are not very good.
5;Sweet, salty, tangy: the way a snack should be;Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors.
5;PB Smoothie Addition;After finally finding a peanut butter with reasonable nutritionals, I must say that I love this product.  For breakfast, I eat it on English muffins with a little strawberry jam and I put a tablespoon in my Weight Watchers chocolate smoothie.
5;Keurig;This is a great coffee brewer. Makes coffee quick and hot.
5;all right by me !!!;These chips are some of the best I've had--ever! They're so good I dare say that they're addictive from the very first time you try a few. The taste of the salsa is delicious and the fresh chips go with lots of other foods.
1;unopenable;The top of the mustard was unopenable.  The plastic chipped, the red pull crumbled.
5;Yummy Ginger Cookies;Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.
5;Good Strong Coffee;This is a good strong coffee - I do use 2 K-Cups for a typical sized coffee cup.  But I prefer a strong blend without the bitterness (Starbucks)<br />Jet Fuel most reminds me of the coffee in Europe, full bodied, strong - always fresh tasting.
1;SUPER SOUR!!!;My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor.
5;Great price for 1lb;I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.
5;Great taste;I love this green mix.  I mix it with almond milk, half a frozen banana and a whole pack of frozen acai and use it as a meal replacement.
4;Pretty good treats.;I came across these treats months ago in Target when I was looking for things  to make my dogs first vet experience a more pleasant one.<br /><br />They were the healthiest things in the store, believe you me!<br />My dog really liked these.
5;our favorite!;Since going gluten-free casein-free over a year ago, we've tried ALOT of snacks only to be disappointed by most! THEN, we tried these..
3;Not as limey as we would have liked;This is a great idea, but it seemed to lack zip.  Maybe not limey enough.
1;Taste like old socks;I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
4;Nice treat;The cappuchino is very sweet. I would recommend running a regular coffee through and make it a mocha.
2;High Glycemic;If you've got sensitive blood sugar, DO NOT eat Kind bars. They are certainly not Kind.
5;Great Product, Healthy and Delicious;Instead of loading this juice up with salt Lakewood Organic added flavor. (some lemon and a hint of Jalapeno and Cayenne pepper, garlic.
2;We thought we were doing our best;My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.  We switched from Similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula.
5;Love these bars;I highly recommend Kind Plus protein bars. They're tasty, satisfying and get me through a workout or balance me after one.
1;Product likely contains GMO corn;"This used to be one of my favorite breakfast cereals, until I learned about GMOs (genetically modified organisms).  Honey Nut Cheerios contains ""modified corn"" as the second ingredient, and since they do not specify ""organic"" or ""non-GMO"", and corn is one of the most genetically modified crops in our country, there is a high probability this cereal contains GMOs."
5;Oh CLICK, where have you been all my life??;I had gastric bypass surgery 16 months ago, and have spent all this time searching in vain for a tolerable protein powder to meet all my nutritional requirements.<br /><br />Then I found CLICK, and everything changed.
5;Wow!;Very tasty. Not too sweet.
4;A Caveat;The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.
5;This curry powder delivers flavor!;I have tried different types and brands of curry powder in cooking various dishes such as rice, veggies and Indian cuisine.<br />So, far The Spice Hunter has been the best of all the brands I've tried.
5;This compares to chamomile tea;I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal.
4;Great Snack or Mixed with Yogurt;This is a great tasting granola that can be easily enjoyed by itself or as a great yogurt mixer which is how I always enjoy it.  It is lightly sweet with a great crunch.
5;So tasty!;I'm oftentimes disappointed by diet food desserts.  Usually they taste a little bit off, probably due to using a sugar substitute.
3;Nice texture, strong aftertaste;I was excited to find this product and found that it has an excellent texture that is light, chewy and crisp.<br /><br />However, the product has a distinct aftertaste that neither my wife nor I found to be pleasant.
5;Best-tasting green tea, in my opinion;Some of the other Yogi green teas, like the one with echinacea, taste kind of bad to me, but I really like the antioxidant one. Not sure if it's actually anti-aging.
1;tasted funny;I have purchased these in the past, but this order tasted a little stale. I have purchased food many times, but this was the first time that I have been disappointed in the quality.
5;It's no chicken of the sea.... that's for sure;This was a xmas present for hubby (lol). He is the only person I know who was delighted to find cans of tuna in his stocking(lol).
5;LUV This Coffee!;"I'm a big time coffee drinker and I tend to like my coffee strong and Tully's French Roast blend delivers! I'm not going to go into all the details about how it taste like ""this or that"" because everybody's taste are different. But if you like a strong, not bitter, cup of coffee that will get you going in the morning, then this is for you."
4;Too much filler material, but chocolate chip the best flavor;I'm not a big fan of the new type of Quaker Oats granola bar
4;average instant coffee;Acceptable for instant coffee but not not worth the extra cost.  Their brewed coffee is so much better.
5;Interesting texture and super-yummy!;"My 6-month-old daughter loves all the ""Brekkie"" blends and we love knowing she's getting to experience a slightly different texture and a very different flavor as well.  I also love feeding her something knowing that I would enjoy it too, it helps me feel like I'm offering her the best (although I will feed her things I personally think are gross, because I don't want to limit her palate at all)."
4;Great Food. Hard to Find.;This is great food for my Doberman. It was recommended by the vet.
5;Effective at lowering cholesterol;Buy this product.  Tell your friends about it.
3;Dog loves it and begged for more. I'm questioning some ingredients.;The first ingredient is Beef! That I like not corn as so many are. It has no artificial preservatives which I like.
1;terrible substitution for a cracker;I've tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren't. If you are desperate for a cracker find another.
5;Great stuff!;This coffee is wonderful.  I love dark, Italian Roast coffee, but it is difficult to find brands that are organic, affordable, and taste nice.
5;Great Dog Shocker;Our 7 pound mutt and our 70 pound weimaraner both received a shock from this on the first day it was plugged in.  That's all it took to keep them out of an area where I've been trying to grow grass for two years.
1;stale and moldybtasting;Have been buying these without looking  the box. I got one box and the bars were broken, stale and moldy tasting.
5;Best Ener-g Bread;This new white rice bread with flax is great.  The flax adds a nutty, wheat-like taste to the bread.
4;Good, mild green;I am an avid tea drinker and so I was at a bit of a loss when I became pregnant.  I wanted to cut caffeinated tea out of my diet during the pregnancy but soon found that meant my choices were limited to herbals and a small handful of decaf black teas, which were mostly flavored.
4;Expensive, but good;It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot.
3;Not bad, not wonderful;"This is a good product for those who want to relive the ""nostalgia"" of having eaten too much of the processed Spaghettio- type canned pasta as a kid.  I wouldn't want to get my kids hooked on the stuff though."
5;Our Favorite Natural Sweetner!;This is the best Agave brand we've used. We use Xagave as our everyday sweetener, as well as a replacement for sugar products in baking and other deserts.
5;Very Sweet Tasting;I received these sardines as a gift and what a pleasant surprise they were! They are even sweeter than the Canadian sardines I am used to eating.  I like to mix them up with some mayonnaise and onions, served on toast for a  tasty lunch.
1;DO NOT BUY! Only One Moozle in order NOT 24!!;The company is trying to rip people off.  Only one mozzle in the package NOT twenty four as stated.
5;Tastes Great!;I don't generally care too much for the healthy alternatives, especially when it comes to coffee. However, after trying Truvia at a hotel, I am now hooked.
5;Perfect.;This salt looks and tastes as though I were on the coast of France gathering it myself. Fresh, flavorful, fantastic, moist, I am loving it in my foods and cooking.
5;Good Strong Coffee;I found this coffee to be full flavored when brewed at 3/4 cup. Not really bitter at all with a smooth flavor.
5;Best microwave popcorn;This is the only microwave popcorn that my family will eat (large pieces, just the right amount of butter flavor, not too salty).  Unfortunately, all of the grocery stores in my city have quit carrying it on the shelves (can't get an answer why), which is why I've ordered it on-line.
3;Ingredients - added sugar?;We bought the 32 oz. vanilla extract.
5;Best vanilla extract + best price per ounce;This is the best per-ounce price I've found anywhere.  I like this vanilla extract better than any of the others I've tried, from good old Schilling/McCormick to Penzey's to some of the Tahitian vanillas.
4;These are pretty darn good.;I have tried microwave cakes in the past and was always disappointed at the texture and consistancy of the end result, but not this time. The cake is almost as good as if you baked it in the oven only much quicker and easier.
5;Kona!! coffee !!!;Tried Kona coffee during a visit to the big island, and fell in love with it.  This coffee is another taste that brings out our love for Hawaii.
3;Sweet an Hot;Not really diggin' these jelly beans.  I love sweet, tart, and hot flavors.
5;Pretty good dark roast;I wasn't expecting much of this product given that I generally don't like Green Mountain Coffee, but to my surprise this was a very good tasting dark roast. It has a strong flavor and nice aroma but not too bitter or watered down.
2;Meh;This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.
1;Salmon Trout;What is 'Salmon Trout' ? Salmon and trout are two different fish. Is this a mistake or a new species I'm unaware of.
1;horrible flavors, not worth the money;I hated the flavors. The sausage bean tasted nothing like sausage.
5;Shaken but not Stirred;Tastes great, but Amazon shipped the 4 jars with no bubble wrap. I could hear them klinking against each other when the mail person delivered the box.
5;This tea is amazing!;I love this tea.  Plenty of dried blueberries.
3;Great concept but peach flavor is underwhelming;Overall, I like the idea of the MIO line.  I have found that it helps me drink more fluids throughout the day and it breaks up the monotony of constantly drinking water.
5;The Best;I found Amano at a chocolate event, and they blew everything else out of the water.  It can be difficult to find single origin chocolate, but they have several options.
5;Beautiful Aroma!;I made Chai tea - as well as a home made chai ice cream and just a chai milk without the tea + cloves, star anise and a few other spices.  But you have to have the cardamom pods and these were wonderful.
1;blue chips;The chips are okay Not near as flavorful as the regular blue chips. Nice size bag for a family.
4;must be good;My kids (11 & 17) ate these so fast I never even got to try them.  I guess they are good.
1;shipping really high - buy at Wegman's;This product tastes good, but you can buy a container of each type for $9 at Wegman's. If you get it from this place, you pay $26 (TWENTY SIX!) for shipping and handling.
1;Disappointing;About half this box of toffee had such a burnt flavor it had to be thrown out.  Very disappointing.
5;great snack;The is great treat for someone with wheat allergies.  Love it in my coffee with almond milk.
5;Pretty tasty - was glad to find them again;These cookies are a tasty snack with some redeeming health value I originally found at Costco last year.  Costco dropped them so I was really glad to find them again here.
4;PICKY PICKY.;MY CAT WILL EAT THIS PRODUCT,PROBABLY BECAUSE HE GET A DIFFERENT KIND EACH DAY.VARIETY IS THE REASON,, HE IS A VERY PICKY CAT.
5;One of the best!;If you like a strong cup of coffee..
5;Portly Bagle Loves It! I know it's healthy.;I have a portly beagle, who is beyond cute but 2 lbs over weight. However, keeping her weight down as she gets older was very important.
4;Great product;Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food.
5;Excellent!;This tea is very hearty..
5;Mmm, has a zing to it.;I actually love this juice.  It has a nice zing to it or atleast to me it does.
5;First I was thirsty, then I was not.;For most bottled waters, there are basically two elements that are required for quality.  First, does it quench the thirst?  Yes, of course it does, it's water.
1;Haribo Versions;German Haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors. German Haribos are all natural.
5;My Boxer's favorite treat!;My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.
5;Love these!;I took a chance on these and they are awesome.  They are crisp and not at all greasy.
1;Not what I thought it would be;I was searching for k-cups on Amazon.  This came up in my search.
2;Way Too Salty;I have enjoyed many Jack Link products over the years, but I cannot recommend this product. It is just far too salty.
1;MY DOG WON'T CHEW;My dog does not nor will she chew on this.  My is not to reason why, but to not buy another.
3;Not bad, but two problems. Pad needs to be replaceable and additional rope.;This item isn't bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn't have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this.
4;Taylor Ham - more like the best meal ever!;"Taylor Ham is the most delicious of all hams. While rather salty, it is deliciously meaty and sizzles with a delightful ""fzzzzzt."
5;Mmmmmmmm!!!! Couldn't be better!;I am so glad to have found these on amazon! They are delicious!! Only one thing--they are so rich & delicious that you almost can't stop---don't make yourself sick on them! They are pretty hard to find so this made me very happy. Thanks for such a fine product.
4;Starbucks VIA Italian Roast;I like the Italian roast but love the Colombian roast, for it's satisfying flavor.<br />Please stock the Hazelnut Blend ,if available.
5;tea;Worked great. A Good must have for breastfeeding mothers.
5;Gatorade;This was on my son's wish list and was sent to Afghanistan as part of his care package. Response time was good and product arrived in good shape.
1;Sickening filler ingredients, high price;I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.
5;Excellent and Super Tasty!;I am so happy that Amazon is carrying this product!<br /><br />This licorice is so much better than what we call licorice here in the US. The flavor of RJ's is amazing - not overly sweet, perfectly balanced, authentic.
5;Fantastic Pumpkin Waffle Mix;Great taste at a fraction of the cost you'll pay at retail shops.  Only downside is the sometimes limited quantities and smaller size (as compared to the 32oz).
1;Stay Away..;The best flavor in my opinion is the original chicken. Seeing the Kung Pao flavor I was excited, after trying it, however, I was not impressed.
5;Much better than expected!;I ordered these chocolate coins for a treasure hunt for my son and daughter. Chocolate coins are available everywhere, so I only really ordered them for the treasure chest.
5;Absolutely Delicious;This is a wonderful example of how a responsible company can put out a very good product while practicing a thoughtful fair trade policy at the same time. I would implore everyone to support the Endangered Species brand.
2;Product is good;
5;One of my favorite teas;In New Jersey, I could regularly buy this tea in the store and did.  In Colorado, the available decaf teas are very limited.
5;Yowzah!!;For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite.
5;Smooth light taste;The coffee has smooth, light taste.  You can taste the flavoring, which is a nice change from some K-Cups where you can only smell the flavor.
5;Excellent tasting tea.;I have tried many OOlong teas and this is by far the best.  It has a wonderfully light coconut, mango flavor.
4;Pleasant Taste;So I brought this coffee into the office to get a few opinions instead of just one. First of, some people may like their coffee REALLY strong, but if you don't, don't follow the instructions on the pack.
5;Surprisingly Good!;About the only time I eat something like this is when I haven't allowed enough time for a proper breakfast before dashing out the door. These bars are tasty and filling without being overly sweet as some such products are.
3;not so sure about this one.;I have an 8 month old hyperactive, constantly chewing puppy. He tends to forget about this toy a lot, it doesn't keep his attention.
5;Just hot water;The caramel ones tastes great with just hot water!<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet..
5;LOVE IT;If you are a fan of REAL ginger-beer, this is your best option.<br /><br />It is absolutely DELICIOUS.
5;Best Green Tea;Love Kirklan's Signature green tea. Every time I open a bag it feels like a treat and I know I'm going to get a quality cup of green tea.
5;Lasted longer than I thought they would;The chew chips lasted a fairly long time for my evil chewers..
2;Not as good as expected;I used these as an additive to my melted chocolate that I was using to cover cake pops and cake bites.  Before, I was just using oil to do the job, which was very successful.
3;Disapointment;I was most disappointed in the 2-Alarm Kit I bought yesterday (January 29, 2011).  I had bought it many times over the last several years but found that today's bowl of chili didn't taste as it used to.
5;High quality, healthy, cheap snack for dogs;This is a great treat for dogs made from high quality meat (venison). They are half the price of the comparable Wellness Pure Rewards venison snacks, which are impossible to find.
5;Choosey mothers actually choose Nutella!;Fantastic spread for bread, toast, crackers, or as a topping on some other food items.  The unique smooth blend of the chocolate flavor with this hazel nut spread makes this product have a more interesting, sophisticated, and more satisfying taste than peanut butter, especially for the adult palate.
3;Average at Best;The ProFlowers One Dozen Long Stemmed Fancy Roses Red Roses arrived promptly, but their quality is disappointing. You can buy better quality red roses for half the price at local supermarkets, Costco, or Sam's Club.
5;too overpriced;I love the coffee.  This is way overpriced.
5;Timothy's Colombian Decaf Coffee For K-Cup Brewing Systems;Everyone enjoys coming to my house and having a cup of Timothy's Decaf Coffee: especially those who have to watch their caffeine as well as those who drink decaf in late afternoon.  It is a very smooth drink and most enjoyable.
5;Very Good Treats;Our vet said that these treats are very good for our dogs. She said the flaxseed is especially good for them.
5;This is all my dog eats!;For reasons I fail to understand only 1 store within a 25 mile radius of my home supplies this food, and about half of the time the product is not in stock. On top of that my 1 year-old chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach so I avoid making any changes within her diet.
5;Great Product;I have used Artemis food for over a 6 month period and couldn't be happier.  It has been the best food for both of my pups (one being a Shih Tzu who has a sensitive stomach).
5;wonderful flavored coffee;I'm a sucker for caramel anything..
4;Last Batch Too Dry;I really like Nana's cookies and have placed several orders.  The Peanut Butter are always dryer than the others, but, unfortunately the last batch of Peanut Butter was way too dry.
4;Meh, it's Stevia.;The vanilla is pleasant enough, but it still has that Stevia aftertaste.<br />I'm going back to sugar (in moderation, of course).
5;hot cocoa;I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.
3;Syrupy taste - but filling;The main virtue these bars have is that they are useful snacks that don't tempt me to eat them up when I don't need them.  Bites with dried cranberries (maybe 3 to a bar) in them taste good enough - otherwise they taste like puffed rice drowned in syrup, which is pretty much what they are.
1;yukky;These cookies are bland and tasteless. The case has 24 packages in it.
4;Very effective;I have been using Neuro Sleep for better than a year for my adult disabled son, to aid him in settling down for bed.  I have found it very effective, with virtually no side effects or interactions with his medication.
4;Bitter Brew, and that's good;"Note: I snipped open the pod and tasted this coffee after preparing it properly, not in a pod.<br />""<br />This is the ""organic medium ethiopia yirgacheffe"" (really)."
5;Excellent coffee.;I was in Maui and had the chance to try the coffee there.  Have been ordering it since coming home.
2;Great texture, very good caramel, but everything is quite lacking;"The combination of real peanuts, chocolate, caramel, and nougat makes for a very satisfying, bite-in-the-bar texture that's a close simulation of a ""real"" candy bar. The flavor, alas, is still a little ""off"", which is why I'm giving it only two stars."
5;Great !;My three dogs like it a lot, and my problem dogs skin has improved dramatically.<br />His hair his growing back and his skin is not red and itchy anymore.
5;Alessi Fig Vinegar Rocks!;Alessi Fig Vinegar has helped me stick to my strictly vegan program as it makes the required tons of green salads more palatable.  I could not do without it and have actually converted others to using it.
5;Great Quality!;Definitely the way to go when you buy the base unit.  Grasses last a long time if you give good light and sufficient water.
5;Many Thanks!;Found a recipe last year that I wanted to make but couldn't find the main ingredient locally. After pondering the situation for a year, I finally broke down and ordered the frosting, even though I had to buy 8 units (which is what held me back last year).
5;Dark Choc is the dominant flavor;
5;Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, healthy, and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!;Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.
5;A Stomach Saver  - and tons of fun!;"When we adopted our dog, she had a variety of medical problems, ""intestinal turbulence"" chief among them.  She was a competitive eater, wolfing down her food in seconds, which contributed to the problem."
5;Award Winning Chile;I use a combination of Pennery's New Mexico and Gebhardt's in my chili. I think the combination produces a very smooth Chili.
2;Watered Down;We bought this KCUP because we wanted some hot cocoa around. It is completely watered down and lacks a lot of the chocolate flavor each time.
5;Great find!;Love this coffee! The aroma is as delicious as the flavor. My husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month, now he's having a cup several times a week.
3;Dogs love them, but I don't think they love dogs;I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.
4;Not Bad at All;To be honest, I don't care if my food is organic and would just as soon die early as eat most health foods. But I do like oatmeal, and have enjoyed other Dr.
4;No need for any cream or sugar with this!;Even for my hubby who likes just a little coffee with his cream and sugar (lol) this was perfect as is straigh from the Keurig machine!  I love how it tastes as well.  It is basically the powdered cappuccino mix in a k-cup.
1;Waggin Train is killing our dogs.;Please do not buy from Waggin Train, their Jerky treats are killing our dogs, they get their ingredients from China,  hundreds of dogs have died from kidney failure.  Please stop this company from operating.
5;Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal With Just the Right Sweetness;Quaker's Oatmeal Squares provides 46 grams of heart-healthy whole grains in a cereal that tastes bold with just the right amount of sweetness.  I don't like overly sweet cereals, and Quaker's Oatmeal Squares fit my taste perfectly.
5;Need a little excitement...;..
5;The name says it all.;I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program.
5;Delightful;I used to get these at my favorite restaurant.  They are exactly the same.
5;Perfect;Love my Hall's Refresh Mint flavored. They are the only ones I can use-- the fruit flavored are funny tasting and leave a sitckey feeling in my mouth.
5;Excellent Coffee;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great on the go stay fresh pouches;Each pouch comes with 6 graham crackers in it.  Just enought to grab as you run out the door with kids.
3;Tastes the same as regular Kraft.  Be aware of smaller size though.;This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.
5;Cats love it;"I got this after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food."
5;Best diet soda so far....;SANS root beer has &lt
5;Yummy!;This stuff is awesome.  I made myself a PB&J this afternoon with the PB2 for the first time.
5;Great Product;Product was exactly as it was described. I am a regular purchaser of Christmas puddings and this was very good.
5;top of our list;Received a box of the Tiger K-cup and shared with my co-workers.  We all really like it.
4;Chewy texture, convenient package;This is a good product to add as a side dish. It has a nice texture, color and taste and isn't your everyday boring, plain white rice.
4;Jasmine matcha - light vegetal flavor - not heavy floral;This matcha smells like a nice light matcha.  I really love jasmine so I had hoped that the scent would come thru, but it did not.
4;It works.;Picked up a single one earlier this week, and tried it out.  It certainly helped, and I'll be buying more.
5;Yum~;These cookies are great. The biscuit part is not too sweet and the inside is a nice vanilla flavor.
4;Accurate ingredient list - good taste but don't forget baby needs protein & fat;My reason for ordering the wasn't just to feed it to my baby since we make a great deal of our own baby food (breast milk and homecooked and blended vegetables, supplemented with heathy proteins and fats very low on the added sweeteners, which includes fruit juices).  I ordered it to try out the packaging, and a competing brand of Organic baby food side by side and also to see if this was something  someone I know with swallowing issues could tolerate with ease and enjoy.
5;Healthy and the dogs love it kind of;I have two cavalier spaniels who are extremely active.  I only like to feed them high quality food.
2;Sub-par in all respects, although my son liked them.;The chocolate and caramel were stale and the tiny nut pieces were rancid. Overall, they were a serious disappointment.
4;Good and tasty, but not as pictured on label.;"I like the noodles and the flavor, and when prepared as instructed they have a nice firm texture (""al dente""), but the shrimp and veggies pictured on the label are really dried and will not look as fresh as they seem on the label.<br /><br />Preparation is not as simple as Nissin, but it has much more flavor."
4;Very easy lunch;I buy mine for about $1. This is a very easy, quick lunch.
5;I love Marmite but its an acquired taste.;Really you have to be brought up on Marmite from a baby to really like it. I'm from England so I've had it on toast with butter all my life.
5;Spicy & Delicious!;We do not eat a lot of Ramen noodles at our house, but we discovered this one at a local Mexican grocery and everyone loves it.  The taste is really delicious, probably the best one I've ever had (out of maybe 6 common ones that I've tried in my life.
5;These are a MUST!!!;My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co.
2;No Hazelnut flavor;Bought this as a gift for a Hazelnut coffee lover who disliked it. She said it doesn't even taste like hazelnut.
3;Dog Teeth Cleaner;I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.
2;Offensive gas producer!!!;I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer.
5;GREAT TREAT;GREAT FOR THAT SPECIAL TREAT.  ESPECIALLY FOR DIABETICS AS THERE IS NO SUGAR.
5;Good stuff, cheaper than grocery store;I am really happy with this oatmeal, tastes the same as the regular stuff, without the extra sugar. Also, the 'lower sugar' is hard to find at my local grocer, and when they do have it, the price is almost twice what Amazon is charging.
5;Works for me - at half dose.;I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.
1;Mocha Nut Fudge? I'm a NUT  for wasting money on it. lol;This coffee is weak and a major disappointment. I gambled on this coffee because of the 3 positive reviews.
5;Nutritious and easy addition to smoothies;I've been trying to incorporate more omega 3's and 6's into my diet in good proportions, and for awhile I was adding ground flax seed to my smoothies (I've heard that you want to try to get more omega 3's than 6's because 3's can promote anti-inflammatory compounds, while too many 6's can promote inflammation and depression), but I had to stop because it was unbearably gritty. In want of a plant-based protein, I bought this product because if it's price and purity.
3;not what i was hoping for;the plant is pretty but they didn't gave me what i ask for. i ask for this plant in this picture and the send me another one with a darker color.
5;Good.;This really make my son's pupu happy. Everyday my son only take in half jar is enough to have soft pupu.
5;great breakfast;
5;The Best;As the others have stated, this is by far the best masala chai I have tried.  I have been loyal to Rishi for a year now, and while I have found some differences across tin batches (my last 3-pack had a surprising amount of ginger), the taste is always exceptional.
5;My 9 month old love this stuff;I'm a new convert to pre-packaged baby food. I typically make all my son's food but even with glass jars with lids its a little messy to tote my homemade stuff when we are out and about.
4;tastes great!;I bought this product because I am on a medically supervised liquid diet. This product was recommended for adding low-calorie, low fat flavor to the shakes I am drinking.
5;Amazing Service;Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had.
3;Not my favorite flavor;I love Stash mint green & white teas but this is not my favorite variation. It's much better over ice than warm so I think I'll use my purchase to make lots of iced tea.
4;Taste Great and Less Guilt;I first found these at Whole Foods but they were so expensive it was prohibitive to buy them often.  However, this deal enabled me to get a whole bunch for a reasonable price.
4;They're OK but not the healthiest of the lot;The Kellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Chocolate and Peanut Butter, is an OK snack bar (hence the 4 stars). With 4g of fiber and 4g of protein per bar, it is a good snack to tide you over those hunger binges.
5;My Dog Loves this Product and she is so picky!;My dog is 14 going on 15 she is a mixed breed chow chow and she has some aches and pains that have become more prominent. She is very picky and refuses pills.
5;Caribou Decaf really good cup of coffee;I believe that this Caribou Decaf would be hard to tell difference in a good cup that is not decaf.  I am really enjoying it at the times that I definitely do not want caffinated coffee.
5;Delightful surprise;I've got a Keurig for my dorm room and I usually just buy a sampler box because I don't really have a preference for any one of the coffees. However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot.
5;Its an instant bowl of rice that it tastes good. Try it!;Even though I live with roommates, whenever I cook a batch of rice in the rice cooker, somehow, after the first bowl I have with dinner, the rest of it always ends up going bad, which means I'm essentially wasting just as much rice as it would cost me to get a single portion like these little guys. My poor mother would be shocked at how much gets tossed.
5;Great customer service!;Unable to shop due to an injury, I realized my daughter's-in-law birthday was imminent. I went straight to trusty Amazon & was thrilled to find Kirkland (Costco brand) chocolate covered almonds, which she loves.
5;Jalapeno Cheese Puffs;These puffs are a good alternative to your regular chips. The jalapeno taste does not overpower the cheese, so its just right.
1;Unhappy hips! supplied by AMAZON;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;wonderful coffe;I was looking for something new in a flavor I thought I would like and came across this brand and flavor. It is now one of my favorites.
5;I haven't ordered these beans yet but...;..
2;Sweaty Work cleaning box with SwheatScoop;Loved the name, loved the concept. I tried this for several months, but I finally switched to Nature's Miracle.
4;Mama Seems To Like Them!;"Visit to the dentist. Dentist say, ""You have several thousand dollars of tooth repair!"" I know why."
1;It's just NOT SWEET!;I like the fact that it uses stevia (how much of it vs. the other sugar alcohol sweetener though?? I think stevia is not toward the top of the list of ingredients) and I have used pure stevia extract before, and I can tell you they are not using very much of it.
5;Awesome Product;Again, this is a great product and company. Other brands of this type do not come up to my standards, and this actually tastes good.
4;Tasty treat!;I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer.
5;Best K cup Coffee;I like almost all of the Green Mountain coffees but Dark Magic is one of my absolute favorites. Robust, deep flavor with absolutlely no bitterness.
5;gingerAZ;This product is very good to take with Oxy-Powder.  It cuts down on the amount of Oxy-Powder one needs and this is very good for ones budget.
4;Good snack food;Package arrived in about 10 days and was intact upon recieving it.  There was enough bars to last me about a month and was a great thing to snack on whenever I was away from the chow hall or on the road during convoys.
5;Excellent quality.  My dogs LOVE it!  =);My Cavaliers absolutely love this product.  I give it to my nursing moms to keep weight on them.
1;Too Salty;I really wanted to like these cookies. I saw them advertised on Dr.
5;Great with Olive oil;Love to have these for lunch. I think this is the best brand of Orzo I've ever had.
5;Exceptional product and results!;Exceptional noticeable results! Have used Taste of the Wild Lamb for 4 weeks. All six dogs(an Aussie, Standard Poodle, Minature Poodles, and Chinese Cresteds) have experienced improved teeth/gums, coat/skin, digestion, alertness and energy.
4;Great taste;I ordered the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew bars and I was pleasantly surprised how good they tasted. My husband likes them and so does my daughter.
1;Very disappointed;I bought this set because it's stated that it had a lime iced tea..
5;Cream of rice by any name is yummy;Cheaper to purchase when the box is in spanish ..
5;UTI;My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year.
5;NOW Organic Brown Rice Syrup;since i am borderline diabetic, i try NOT to use sugar products at all.  many web sites recommend using brown rice syrup for recipes for diabetics, though, so i've decided to give it a chance.
4;Organic Toaster Pastries decent healthy snack/breakfast food;I like these because the are fast, easy, healthy, and reasonably tasty quick breakfast or snack food. Definitely taste better warmed in the toaster.
2;Not very friendly in my machine;I've tried numerous creamers in my Tassimo and thought why not save a few calories.  Well I won't try it again.
5;Great Bars;I really liked these bars. They are really good.
5;A great spiced tea.  Very unique.;I've enjoyed this tea for years.  It used to only be available from it's source, the spice market at Pike Place Market in Seattle.
1;Yuk...worst fiber cereal;This is the worst tasting fiber cereal I have ever eaten! It was so bad I would have sent it back, but I am living in the middle of the South Pacific and it would have been too costly.  It tasted like unpoped popcorn kernels, gets stuck in back of throat, and has an after taste.
3;Good...but not the best;This is my third order of Turkish pistachios from three different vendors. As with the two previous orders, the nuts are good, but not the freshness or quality I experienced on my many trips to Turkey.
5;Great flax product;This product is a great source of Omega-3's. It's a pretty good quality and goes into smoothies very well.
5;YUMMY!  And perfect snack size;My Daughter is six and has Celiac Disease.  She has to bring her own snacks to school and she loves these!  She loves the taste, but also the fact that they look like other kids snack packages.
5;Surprisingly effective nutrition;Protip: Keep it in the freezer in ziploc bags with the air squeezed out. I kept most of it in a jar in the fridge, but the air in the jar was apparently still spoiling it slightly.
4;Pleasantly surprised;I've never been a big fan of thai tea, but my husband loves it, so I looked on Amazon for a thai tea I could make myself.  I've always found that if I make something myself, it's more enjoyable than when I buy it pre-made, and this tea is no exception.
5;Lindt Pistachio Chocolate;Excellent. Very nice, rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle.
5;The only Dark Chocolate for people watching their calories;This chocolate is exceptional for having no sugar added.  I have a friend in Singapore who also watches calories, loves dark chocolate, and is lactose intolerant.
4;Not for broccoli lovers;I liked this.  As far as meals in a box go, this had a pretty good flavor.
5;Healthy, light cereal;A nutritionist recommended this cereal to me. She said look for cereal which has under 8 or 9g of sugar.
1;I really really wanted to like this one;I am the type of person to continue to use something even when I don't necessarily like it just to get my full money's worth. This, though, I just couldn't do.
4;creamy, tasty;Great coffee, but beware- these pods are not working on all the espresso machines. I have a Mr.
4;Strawberry 1, Watermelon 0;I couldn't really taste the watermelon but there was a very sweet overall flavor to the drink. The sweetness was of course augmented by the strawberry.
3;Sort-of Matcha... OK for smoothies;If you've ever had real matcha, this will be a disappointment. The powder looks like a light grayish-green.
1;Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?;I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees.
4;I hate diet soda..... But this is good stuff;Okay I have tried every diet soda, I have cravings for soda but no one needs the large amount of high fructose corn syrup that they put into the regular sodas. The Zevia Ginger Root Beer is Good.
2;It's beef jerky ...;I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it.
5;Good flavor;First time ordering this flavor, with excellent results.  Would recommend to others as a smooth blend.
5;Finally a good source for poppy seeds;My grandma made the best poppy seed buns when I was a kid, but in the USA I was forced to buy the poppy seeds in a tiny glass jar for $4.98 and they were always stale.
5;Warning: Highly addictive and delicious;These truffles are the best I've ever had and I believe it is impossible to eat just one at a time. If you buy these I recommend hiding them from your loved one so that you get them all.
5;Best tasting HEALTHY cereal...;"I have been eating continuously for over a year now and love it! I love the taste and I know what all of the ingredients are. Do yourself a favor and look at the ingredients of other ""healthy"" cereals from other brands like Kellogg's and General Mills."
4;Smooth & East to Drink;I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I prefer a robust and gritty coffee.  This was a light and smooth flavored coffee.
3;Great Cereal - Do Your Homework on Cost;I'm a big fan of Kashi Heart to Heart.  Sure, it's not a cereal most kids will like, but I find it's great for someone who is working to eat healthy as an adult.
5;Great for infants!;My 9 month old daughter loves these! She'll sometimes reject food if she's having tummy troubles or cutting a tooth, so I turn to these on those days. I never have problems getting her to eat them, I feel like she's getting great quality food, and they mix well with cereal.
4;Easy to make but gets cold fast;I love mac and cheese and this is a dish close to that. It has a few packs of ingredients, pasta, cheese, dried broccoli, seasoning.
4;"A Nice Little ""Pick Me Up"".";"Being someone who actually does NOT like bananas, this was actually quite delicious. Though this product, among a few others, was sent to me for testing purposes compliments of Influentser through their ""Summer Beauty Voxbox"" program, I would say that this would be a nice ""pick me up"" snack on the go."
5;I love Moroccan Mint;Stash is my favorite tea, and by far the Moroccan Mint is my favorite flavor.  I love mint, and the mix of green tea and mint is just delcious.
3;Too weak vs Nespresso Roma and Ristretto;I use Nespresso Roma, and my wife uses Nespresso Ristretto.  We bought Cremosa and Espressivo as possible substitutes, because lower per-capsule price, free shipping with my Amazon Prime, and I don't have to use the Outpresso to recycle.
3;Pretty good but not perfect.;Got our storage drawer for a great price and really like the look and functionality but..
2;What happened to the larger cans??;Question:  Are the larger (27.7 oz.
4;too small of a box;Love the broth, but didn't realize it was the small boxes.  I use broth all the time and next time will look for the bigger boxes.
2;salt and vinegar chips;It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again.
5;Iffy;My little dogs liked these at first,  but I guess they were too big for my yorkie and POM cause if they didn't finish it,  maybe it gets stale?  I don't know?  They just don't want it.  It's been sitting there a few months now.
5;Good Oatmeal;Doesn't break down to mush when cooked.  Still retains some body.
3;doesn't taste like hazelnut;While it didn't taste like hazelnut at all to me, I like this product. I just mixed it in with the regular unflavored.
5;Mellow;No bitterness here..
5;The best marzipan ever!;We just got the marzipan in the mail and it is the best marzipan we've ever had--worth every penny. There is absolutely no yucky taste of corn syrup (it's not one of the ingredients)and this is not too sweet as other marzipan made in the U.
5;Great flavor!;Excellent product! A tip from the Keurig people: shake the K-cup before using it. This prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.
2;Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!;I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.
5;Don't fade buy Accelerade!;The only product I use for my century rides. I looked around for a great buy and found this seller.
5;Excellent in every way!;This is the best for both taste and aroma. It will make your day start on the best note possible.
5;A crowd pleasure;This seasoning MAKES the best pinto beans I've ever tasted. Gives it a rich flavor that beats all other attempts at seasoning combos that I've tried to pull together over the years.
5;Fresh;This was very good, fresh perfect flavor good size, packed well and received quickly. Not too moist, not too dry and perfect chew.
5;Last of the Hungry Jack;I am telling you I was lucky. I checked and found this to be the last two bottles in stock.
2;Cardboard taste;I just purchased this product and it was sent to me on thursday.  When I say nasty, cardboard taste, please believe me.
1;May not be totally gluten free;I ordered this for my mom, who has Celiac disease. She could not tolerate it, it gave her bad diarrhea, as if it had gluten in it.
1;Not good at all;I have a yorkie (4 lbs) so I got the extra small one. Not a single doggie-bite-size treat could come out from where it supposed to, and that was me trying to get the treats out.
2;sent the wrong grind;the company sent me whole bean instead of fine grind but when i called to complain they gave me my money back and i got to keep the product so everything was okay there. its okay too because illy is the best espresso.
5;Love these practical and environmental friendly bags;I have a 20 lb dog, so these bags are perfect to dispose his not-too-large waste. They are easy to carry, resistant, and biodegradable, you cannot ask for more.
1;This case of Recharge tasted sour.;I have gotten cases of this Lemon Recharge and never had any problem, but this case I recently purchased tasted bad. It had a bad aftertaste and made me feel sick.
2;Not What I Expected;From the name and the description, I was expecting a creamy drink.  This is just coffee with a little caramel flavoring, barely enough to taste.
5;Yum.;I mean yum.  Caramel with sea salt is like the best thing ever.
5;Great Product;This curry ketchup tastes great with any type of brautwurst or sausage.  It brings a great taste of Germany to your food.
4;Good product, just not right for me;I bought the mini size buster cube thinking it would work for my little mutt (15lb beagle/pom mix) since I had seen other reviews mentioning how much their small breed dogs loved it. Maybe it works better in a home with carpeting, but it turned out that it was too large for my little girl (who is insanely food-motivated)to flip over easily on a consistent basis (the flooring is too slick so when she put her paw on it to flip it over, it just skidded around).
1;American Kennel Club Chicken Poppers;One would assume that American kennel club chicken poppers would be manufatured in the United States, however these are not made in the usa. Had to return the product.
4;Fresh and Tasty;I liked the taste of these cookies and they reminded me of my childhood.<br /><br />However, these are packaged different.
3;Product as described, texture as expected...;I've had shirataki noodles before, most have soy and other items in them that increase the calorie count. These ones DON'T.
4;Read it once. Read it twice. Reading Chicken Soup With Rice;"These days, when a person says, ""chicken soup"" they're probably going to follow up those words with, ""for the soul"" or maybe ""for the teenaged soul"".  Didn't used to be that way."
1;Indian Coconut Oil;I had previously bought various brands of certified organic and extra virgin coconut oil from the Philippines and was very pleased with them. I decided to try an Indian coconut oil.
5;Delicious and refreshing;I've become addicted to these delicious, refreshing and healthy drinks. Highly recommended.
5;Perfect and not messy!;Love these.  Not messy.
3;No longer taste like Samoas;These bars used to taste like Samoas, BUT a few days ago I bought a new box. The bars taste different.
5;Very good if you like Chai Tea;Either you like it or you do not. We do, so it is 5 stars.
2;not what I expected;I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.
5;Light and Yummy!;I totally agree. These are a light, low-cal, tasty snack! I am in Canada at the moment and was going to buy some to bring home with me for I did not think you cannot purchase them in the US.
2;OK, but could be chocolatier;This didn't have a lot of chocolate taste for the recommended serving size.  Or the right amount of sweetener.
5;Fibromyalgia;"I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word ""magnesium"" popped into my mind."
5;Best Decaf Tea;Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea, Sweet Coconut is my favorite decaf tea. I drink it all day.
5;Cat Heaven;Wonderful product in many ways.  Cats coat are shedding less and beautifully silky.
5;Healthy Treat;All of us like to give treats to our pets, but some of them are just too high in fat or too calorie laden.  My dog was just diagnosed with diabetes, and our vet suggested we use these chicken bits as her treats instead of the normal Milk Bone type biscuits.
5;The best;Was'nt sure what to expect. If you pop one whole into your mouth, you get the creamy carmel, dark chocholate and the salt altogether.
4;Tasty, not spicy...;I like them, but they did not strike me as being remarkably different or more smoky than more readily procurable brands. I would only get them again if the shipping were less expensive.
5;Mussini Balsamic Glaze;I originally bought the glaze at a local produce store, but they stopped selling it. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.
5;Inferno Sticks - Yummy!;"Way beyond the tolerance level of people with ""room temperature"" palates, but if you like HOT!!!, then this flavor is the one to buy. I WILL be ordering more in the near future."
5;Wonderful bread every time.;Highly recommend this product.  Bread is one of the better gluten-free breads on the market, alongside making your own from scratch.
4;Good, Refreshing and packs only 140 calories!;"Honestly, I'm not really a big fan of carbonated drinks, but upon seeing ""Switch Watermelon strawberry in the vine program I figured I'll give it shot. I do like weird drinks and weird food so why not? What really grabbed my attention is the fact that the drink is a supposed blend of real juices and carbonation with NO sugar added and no corn syrup."
5;Great for picky sensitive dogs;I have two English bull terrier with bad allergies. One of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that I bought.
5;Great Tea!;The first time I tasted anything from Yamamotoyama was at Epcot Center in their Japanese exhibit. I thought that only Epcot would sell the teas, but then found out otherwise.
5;Hemp seeds;Very great deal on hemp seeds as in teh stores you get very little for alot more price. Very pleased.
4;Great Tasting by itself!;This is a great tea that I'm using with a 2 week detox plan. Now I like all kinds of teas mainly for the healthy attributes, NOT TASTE.
5;Yum;I love ice cream - and mint chip is one of my favorites.  I was skeptical about this, but I was at NASA and wanted to bring something back.
5;LIFESAVER;Baby had horrible colic and there was IMMEDIATE improvement once changing to nutramigen. Always received in timely fashion.
5;Just what I was looking for.;To begin, disregard the low ratings for this item given by other reviewers. 1: they are not reflective of the coffee as a product, and 2: the issue was obviously a market-wide increase in price as I cannot find any site or retailer that sells them for the prices they claim.
5;Great cat food, great value;I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon.
5;Good source of protein!;My six month old loves peas and brown rice.  Each jar contains 3 grams of protein  which works out to be 22% of the daily value.
4;Makes a good batch;I have trouble finding falafil mix in my local stores, so I was very happy to see this available on Amazon.  Casbah mix (my favorite) is quicker to prepare -- absorbs water for 10 minutes rather than 30 for Ziyad, but Ziyad seems to make more falafil per package.
1;Very Fragile dog toy for big dogs;My dog did not have a time to play with this toy. He just thrown the cube to the wall and then, the cube was split into 2 pieces, broken!<br />Do not recommend it for big dogs (Labs).
3;Okay;A good snack but became sick of it. The sticks are about 3 inches in length.
5;Convenient, affordable, and delicious;These VIA Ready Brew coffee packs are convenient for me to have coffee on the go in the morning. There's no longer a need to use my espresso machine or wait in line at my local Starbucks.
4;Good deal;A great product. I like this better than making a pineapple upside down cake from scratch.
4;good taste;I'm always looking for a good energy drink, that will give me a boost, but not a big let down.  I like the glaceau energy water.
5;Tasty;Mushrooms can add a lot of flavor to a dish.  Canned mushrooms are bland and boring and fresh mushrooms have a limited shelf life.
1;Check ingredients before purchasing!!;The labeling debate continues ..
5;Simply the Best;No, I don't understand the subtle flavorings that critics talk about. I just know after 51 years of drinking coffee, this is simply the best tasting coffee I have ever had.
5;to $ here;I absolutely love this stuff. I mix it with water to make peanut butter, add it to cold noodles to make Chinese cold peanut noodles, sprinkle it on ice cream and mix it in my protein drinks.
5;Very good quality;These are very good organic walnuts.  They are not dried out and have a sort of sweet flavor to them.
5;Absolutely delicious!!!;Excellent product- has a great taste and a great price. If you like iced coffee, this is definitely something worth trying.
5;Careful, it is smaller than it looks in the picture;I usually do not have much time for shopping grocery, however I really love oyster mushrooms. This dried kind on Amazon is perfect me.
3;Not the best flavor;Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.
4;I like them.;"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips."
5;Dogs love these;It is hard to find Greenies at a good price. This was the best price that i have found recently.
5;DAK Ham makes the best Ham Salad.;A little mayo and sweet relish and great tasting ham salad results.<br />DAK Ham is priced right, tasty and easy to store in quanity.
5;Wonderful;I really enjoy this flavor.  It is somewhat sweet and puts and finishing touch to whatever I eat, or as a wonderful flavor to relax with.
5;Great for on the go!;These are wonderful for busy moms and dads.  When our little one needs to eat, these tubes offer a quick way to deliver food.
5;Perfect snack;I found Larabars a couple of years ago when I started looking for ways to help my husband find healthy, filling snacks that were low in sodium. He loves these.
5;Nice truffle flavor;This is a nice grind of salt with a strong truffle smell/taste -- it is on a par with the truffle butter I buy at Dean & Deluca.  Would buy again.
2;Not very assorted;Of the 34 K-Cups, there was only 10 varieties.  We received about 6 of the same French Vanilla and Hazelnut.
1;Unhappy with this product;I was very disappointed with the quality of these Juniper Berries. They dry and hard and had no aroma or taste.
5;My Favorite--I LOVE this stuff;I have multiple food allergies, which makes a grab-and-go breakfast..
5;Help my dogs joints;I have a 7 year old chocolate Lab. Whom I love to death, I told his vet I was given him this medication at the time it was in a pill form upon his physical last year (annually check up) she told me to continue with the joint medication.
5;Amazing Coffee, Great Price Through Amazon;The BEST flavored coffee I've ever enjoyed.  Especially with French Vanilla liquid creamer.
4;7 out of 10 tuffies scale is accurate;My black lab's purpose in life is destruction.  Nothing gives her more pleasure than to rip stuff apart.
2;Deceptive little buggers;I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.
5;Works Great For Studying;I use 5 Hour Energy for studying and its great! I was first skeptical about using this product and thought it was just another product that a company used mass advertising to make it seem good but the product actually does what they say it does. I don't feel any crash or get jittery after using this (Unless i use this 3-4 days in a row,then i crash.
5;Outstanding Pizza Mix;Gluten Free Natuals makes the best gluten-free products I've ever had.  The pizza mix actually tastes like a wheat-based pizza should taste.
1;too expensive;Got this item for 15.00 at my local New York Costco.
4;My Dog loves these Treats;My Dog absolutely loves these treats. All I have to do is say their name and I have his full and undivided attention.
3;Good idea for certain dogs/needs, but...;As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting.
5;best beef jerky ever!;This beef jerky is amazing. I have been looking for this kind of jerky for years and finally found it on amazon.
5;Fantastic food!;My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it.
1;STALE.  Beware buying these on special!;I've bought these at the local supermarket and enjoyed them although they are so salty that a few leave my tongue and roof of my mouth burning.  Keeps you from eating too many!  Occasionally I get really stale items from Amazon.
5;Great Dark Chocolate;The dark chocolate with expresso is so..
5;Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee;I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with.
3;it will dry out if exposed;I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it.
5;Great Snack!;While on vacation, I picked up two bags of these to put in our backpacks while hiking.  We loved them, and haven't found this mix since returning home.
5;Sandra from WA;If you like cookies, you may have problems stopping at just a couple. These are gluten and wheat free.
1;The mint tea I bought;When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed.
5;Best. Fruit Snacks. Ever.;I will start off by saying these things are downright addicting.  I eat a packet or two every day and I highly recommend them.
5;Dog treats;Both dogs love the nutritious treats. The chicken breasts are used sparingly.
5;Delicious low fat treat.;Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.
5;Get My Head Out Of This Little Tin Can, Please!;Oh, Holy Cow, these things are delicious.  Very zingy, but delicious.
3;It's had a hard shelf life;The cereal has been on a long journey from the Swiss mountains to California and it shows. The Cereal has been bounced into powder.
5;Perfect gift!;I bought this as a Mothers Day present and it was so well received! Mom thought it was beautiful and made delicious tea.  The packaging was also quite attractive.
5;Great like a tea bag with good coffee inside;This is so handy for work.  Microwave a cup of water and dip a coffee bag in it.
5;A great tea!;This is similar to a herbal that I mix up myself from bulk teas.I now have enough to last all winter.
5;Makes life so easy;We bought an old-fashioned trolley popcorn machine for our children at church. These packages make popping popcorn in large quantities so easy.
5;I wish I had tried this years ago;I first heard about this type of supplement around 15 years ago and never gave it much thought other than I was slightly intrigued. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I decided to add this to my diet.
5;MOST OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE HAD FROM AMAZON;WOW! Where to start.<br />I ordered these chocolates for a friend that is a big fan of this liquor
5;Nice popping oil;This is a perfect oil to cook popcorn in. The price is much more reasonable than similar oils you purchase in the grocery store.
4;value;I don't drink coffee but I got it for my Husband.  He said it is pretty good.
5;An adult fan, for sure!;As I have said in other reviews, I enjoy eating healthier yet have little time to eat at work. I have been trying to move myself away from fattier, oily snacks during my day and sugary sweet drinks to wash them down.
5;Sazon Seasoning Mix, salt free;This is excellent and very tasty, I use to use Goya Sazon still love it, but due to being on a mostly salt free diet have to buy<br />the salt free version and this surpassed my expectations. It is the same as the Goya only without the salt, I live in<br />Massachussetts and it is impossible to find salt free Sazon, thank god for Amazon.
5;REFRESHING ORANGE JUICE DRINK WITH A KICK;"Refreshing orange juice drink with a good kick to it. If you drink this first thing in the morning with breakfast, it's sure to be a real eye-opener! It's a ""juice"" drink, not soda pop."
5;Dogs Love These;I have two dogs with sensitive stomachs and allergies, so normal raw hide bones cause them to get sick. Other non-raw hide, natural bones my dogs can devour within minutes, they are heavy chewers.
5;Great stuff;I love that it comes with a spray and refills and the washing bowl/strainer.  The bowl is great for cherries and strawberries or any fruit/veg that you're not going to wash one at a time.
5;excellent coffee/flavor;My husband and I lived in the French Quarter of New Orleans for a while ( he group up in the city).  He has a certain taste for coffees that remind him of home.
5;Great, healthy snack;Our rat terrier, Frisky, is diabetic and also had trouble with her liver and pancreas two years back.  I am very careful what food she eats, but I feel these snacks are okay for her.
5;Excellent ginger, excellent service;Chimes ginger is the best ginger candy I've ever tasted, that's why I bought it!  I had a sample of a ginger chew a month ago and I liked it so much I tracked down the company and found a distributor that sold it in larger quantities.  I bought a pound which is a good amount for me, the little bags don't hold enough.
1;Not at all worth the risk.;My dogs nearly died from eating chicken jerky treats from China. Kidney damage is permanent.
5;Good Mild Coffee;I was surprise at the smooth light coffee flavor.  Good cup for later at night when you want a cup of coffee without staying up too late.
5;delicious snack;ASIN: B000F4EUAM  Let,s Do Organic Jelly Gummi Bears,3,5-Ounce Boxes.<br />We started to buy these bears 6 months ago for my daughter who is 10 years old because she has PKU and cannot  have most candies on the market( no gelatin,no milk,no flour,etc.
5;Best chips ever;We'd been looking for great tasting, organic snack chips.  After trying these chips, we stopped looking.
4;Very good compared to others;If you're looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter (whatever reason) this is a good choice.  It's nice and crunchy, tastes better than other brands I've tried, and doesn't separate as much as others.
3;It cleans :);I used Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo and have a few pros and cons. Pros: use a small amount, lathers well, smells nice, cleans hair well.
5;"simply a ""Great tasting coffee""";A rich bold taste that maintains smoothness.  No bitter aftertaste.
1;Product contaminated;I purchased two bottles at the beginning of June and when they arrived both contained clear liquid. We started using one bottle and just recently noticed there was fluffy foreign material in the bottom of the bottle.
5;bddtacm;I love the Senseo Coffee, dark roast especially.  My son introduced this coffee to me years ago and I have worn out two Senseo coffee pots.
5;For those of you who have been searching for Clearly Canadian and those who haven't;Years ago Clearly Canadian offered flavored, carbonated water in glass bottles. As the years went by it was harder and harder to find as grocers and gas stations stopped carrying it.
4;Tastes Ok...works well;I usually carry a bottle of Cytomax when running in the hot Hawaiian sun..
4;Yummy But Salty!;After reading many reviews I decided to give it a try..
5;Dark Magic is my kind of Magic;Green Mountain's Dark Magic Extra Bold is my go-to coffee for use with my Keurig coffee machine. I go through more of this particular flavor then any other type of coffee.
1;Where's the Cheese?;"I don't taste cheese - I taste an unidentifiable chemical and a LOT of salt!  Normally I LOVE salty snacks, and especially cheesy ones, but the salt is overwhelming. YUCK! Do NOT believe the ""better than Cheetos"" hype."
5;Perfect problems solver;This is the best number one way to hide pills from dogs. I have to give my dog a daily medication and this works wonders.
5;Bacon-licious!;It is hard to put into words on how great this product is.  Not only does it come with multiple varieties of Bacon Salt, all excellent by the way, but included is a jar of Baconnaise and Lipbalm.
1;They won't touch it.;My cats are gravy lickers who tend to leave the meat in the bowl. They love canned (rinsed) tuna, so I've been trying to find a wet food they'd enjoy as much to transition them off of dry.
5;My Vice;Oh, boy. These cookies are TOO good.
4;Healthy snacking;For food sensitivities to gluten this is a great cracker with wholesome grains. It does not taste artificial in any way.
1;I'm not going to buy the product again via mail;I relly liked it last time I got it from local store. However, the package came with melted bulk.
4;Volvic Water Pricing Change;The French Volvic Water taste great.  I like it much better than the other water competitors.
5;So incredibly delicious;I sampled these bars at a bike event and I was hooked.  I ordered them on-line because I wanted too many to eat and the individual cost is significantly higher.
5;Fresh, convenient, great value;I like the convenience of tea bags.  This is one of the better premium brands in terms of freshness and flavor.
5;Really Spicy!;I love spicy food and this product is really spicy and has good flavor at the same time. For some may even be too spicy to eat.
5;Robust plant;I ordered this plant along with Rubber Tree Plant. The plant arrived packaged very well and in excellent condition.
4;Delicious and nutritious;My boxer loves these treats. They are great because you can break them into several different pieces and fit them into different sized toys.
4;Our family drink of choice!;We de-soda'd our house, and this is our new drink of choice. Very refresing, and always ready! We keep a pitcher in the refig.
5;Cheesy, spicy, delicious;These are really tremendous.  Excellent crunch and flavor, among the best I've ever had.
5;Molly;The spiced chai I bought is wonderful, the flavor is so rich, smooth and creamy.  Definately worth the price.
5;Greenies;Received as promised. What can you say about dog treats? I personally haven't tasted one! lol Shipper was prompt for delivery.
5;Great for pregnant women!;My wife suffered from swollen feet and hands during our pregnancy with our first and third children.  This helps alleviate those symptoms without any harm to the baby.
5;One of the Best Candy Bars on the market!!!;I used to hate dark chocolate, and well Candy bars in general.  I came across this brand of Candy Bars while living in Vermont.
4;Nutritious, low sodium, calorie controlled, tasty, easy to prepare;"I love this popcorn!  I did have to learn to avoid the ""popcorn"" setting on my microwave because the bag is small and the popped corn can begin to burn in under 2 minutes. The portion size is just right."
5;My mouth is watering while writing this review;I just tried these for the first time last night..
5;Great tea;Like another reviewer, I do not taste sweet honey overtones either
5;good tasty treat;My 11 month old daughter loves these. Not only is the taste great, the texture is really soothing to her gums.
1;Hill's cat food is not good for your cats!;We always thought the Science Diet (Hill's) cat food was good. But, NO!!!!! My two cats all developed kidney stones and one died of CRF after eating this brand food for several years.
5;Almonds with heat;These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand.
3;Kind and Healthy?;I may have gotten a bad batch, but these tasted stale to me. I'm also frustrated with poor marketing.
5;Yummy!;I work with special needs kids, some are on the gfcf diet. It's nice to have a snack that everyone can enjoy.
2;Lack of info;I would like to submit a useful review on this product however, it arrived without any directions.  The container states that it's good for dry scalp and if you lift the label the ingredients are listed underneath.
2;Medium is too small for my 37 pound dog!;I was very disappointed when my dog had the everlasting treat out within 5 minutes.  And when I put it back in and let it dry, he had already figured it out and popped it out in seconds.
5;Product was what I expected/Was delivered quickly;Good Product..
5;Compares favorably to previous brand I used to buy;I'm drinking this green tea as I type up this review. I made a cup of the Bigelow green tea, and this store brand tea I used to buy because it was the cheapest one on the shelf.
3;Don't hate it, but don't love it;"Like one of the previous reviewers, I found that the artificial sweetener left an aftertaste, as they often do. I am a huge dark ""drinking chocolate"" fan but this didn't taste natural to me."
5;Good value and Good tastes;This sampler was good.  We had plenty of hot chocolate with different flavors to please the kids and adults in the family.
5;glencovers;My wife and I really like these fruit strips. Our granddaughters like them also.
5;The Best!;I've tried other stevia sweeteners, and they can't compare to Truvia. It is just like sugar -- not bitter like the others.
4;Goji medicine;Okay as goji berries go.  The usual dehydrated little berries.
5;My dogs like it;I have 2 large dogs who I allow to lick this every day. They seem to like it.
5;Treats for Chewers!;Jack is a 3.5 year old papillon.
5;Zoe Oil is excellent!;I bought the Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil because it was at a great price.  I like the fact that it is organic.
5;Booda bones;My dog really enjoys the Booda bones.  I was very pleased with the price I received and also the fact that they arrived  earlier than expected.
5;Kitten Treat;My kitten loves this stuff!  It is very hard to find this product in the grocery store. Thanks for the quick service.
1;cheaters;1 star is far too good..
5;Great alone...better with....................;First time purchaser on Timothy's 'White Hot Chocolate'.  I made a cup Saturday morning and liked it alot, however it was a bit watery and kind of sweet.
5;Excellent product!;I've taken magnesium for years, quality brands, and know it is helpful for my health problems.  I just tried this brand this time and was amazed at how quickly after drinking it I felt very calm and relaxed.
5;Yummy goodness for only 150 calories per pint!;No longer are the arctic zero ice creams icy - the company upped the calories to 150 per pint but the taste is much creamier and a bit sweeter.  The cookies and cream is now my favorite.
4;Pumpkin goodness;So frothed up on its own (no additions) it was quite spicy. Well, not spicy hot but tasted a lot like spices! The pumpkin was definitely in the smell though, so I knew it was a pumpkin tea and not just a spice tea!<br /><br />Of course, what's a pumpkin pie matcha without a latte? This is where the tea did SHINE! I frothed up the matcha with a bit of brown sugar then added about ¼ cup warm water.
5;Best coffee I've tasted. I try others but always come back.;If you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it. I have tried others and just keep coming back to this one.
5;Good snack and dessert for a good price;I use this finely shredded coconut flakes for late afternoon snacks at work and sometimes as dessert at home. I mix 15 raw almonds (soaked in spring water for at least 8 hours) with 3 table spoons of coconut flakes and 1 table spoon of raw unheated honey.
5;Hottest sauce I own!!!! Unbelievable;I have tried many sauces from Habanero, to 7 Pod and Trinidad Scorpion, to the Ghost Chilli, and to those not too tasty extracts. And this is the hottest one I have.
3;ACTUAL ingredients...;I have not used this product yet, so the review is purely to inform potential consumers of the actual product ingredients.  The ingredients listed on the product label (dark chocolate variety) are:<br /><br />Sugar, Palm Kernel Oil, Cocoa Powder, Buttermilk, Soy Lecithin and Natural Vanilla Flavor.
5;DELICIOUS COFFEE AND TEA QUICKLY;The K-Cups were purchased for my grand-daughter. She loves the coffees and teas and that it takes less than a minute, usually only about 30 seconds, to brew a delicious cup of coffee.
5;EXCELLENT CHOICE OF CANNED CRABMEAT;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Surprisingly light and refreshing;"For some reason, I had it in my head that this was iced coffee similar to a iced cafe mocha than a Coke that lost its carbonation. I really don't know where I got that idea because the description is clear ""Coffee Drink, Caffe""."
3;Not worth of price;This cliff bar is much more expensive than the nature valley products. But, it is not worth to be pricey.
5;Works Great, takes  time;Been using this starter for a year now, and it's become like an old friend. A few quirks, with a little personality, but a reliable producer of bread every week for my family.
2;I was disappointed in this can of fruit!;This is just one of two types of canned fruit from Roland that I do NOT like.  It's like they picked totally unripened  pineapples and just sliced and packed them in the unripened fruit juices.
5;Best Natural Protein;Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there.
5;No need to eat candy bars again!!;These are great, way better than a Snickers and healthier. Great to carry one with me when I am out for the day.
3;pretty good except for maki;For some reason, some people don't like nori so you're stuck using these often times.  They may be good for non-sushi related dishes, but if you want to make maki you'll want to try it the normal way instead of inside-out.
2;salt and vinegar chips;It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again.
5;Superb!;When we purchased our puppy from a kennel one hour from our house this is the type of food they had us purchase for our new puppy.  Once we got home we couldn't find it anywhere so we looked online.
5;So good!!;This is the first time trying this brand. These taste so good and they are good for you, which is even better.
5;radtechmom;Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep.
5;Great flavor;I really enjoy the Crystal Lite Green Tea Raspberry flavor, especially in the on the go size. Only problem is finding it.
4;Pretty good stuff, with the right sweetener;This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste.
5;a good value;these are a good size to perfectly go with a sandwich or a burger or even as a snack.  tasty and fresh and even survived the trip to me in tact.
5;M. Larson;"We tried these ""candy bars"" in Hawaii.  They are about as healthy as a candy bar can get."
3;Dog loves the food, but the cans were badly dented;My dog is a finicky eater when it comes to canned food.  After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).
4;Good Tasting Sugar Free Candy - Recommended;IBC Sugar Free Root Beer Barrels are very good tasting hard candies. These are sweetended with sucralose (Splenda), and taste very close to regular root beer barrel candy.
5;yummy & A+++++ service;We have loved Mr. Yoshida's sauce for many years.
4;It's not exactly a coffee, but it's pretty good.;I'd say it's more like an alternative to hot chocolate: no real coffee taste that I could distinguish, but a nice, homey, warming flavor as you drink it.<br /><br />As with other instant blends, you have to play around a bit with the mix-to-water ratio, but when you get it right, this is an altogether pleasant drink to help you wind down at the end of a stressful day.
5;my fave soft drink, and mixer;If I'm drinking something, this is probably it. I even prefer the can over the bottle, the taste is just subtly different.
5;Taste;Everyone that tastes these chips LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!! They all ask where they can get them.  Thank you for the email on when they were back in stock.
2;Great sauce but know what you are getting before you order...;"First of all let me say Marie Sharps is a fantastic do it all hot sauce, it works well in most if not all situations in which some more ""heat"" is needed. With that being said all this combo pack is the same sauce in bottles labeled differently, if I would have known this I would have just bought a larger bottle of their Habenaro pepper sauce and not six bottles of the same sauce at a much higher price."
5;Great;I love this granola.  The best I have yet had.
5;Great deal;These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.
5;Wellness Canned Puppy Food;Good product for good pups, even not so good pups.  Price was right, packaging was good, cans were intact, not dented, as were the turkey/sweet potato adult cans (24 of them).
5;My Dog LOVES These;I'm quite sure I reviewed this product before. But, since you're asking.
5;The best corn chips out there;Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.
5;Picky cats choose this  :);We have two gorgeous Maine Coon boys who started out on Royal Canin for kittens.  When we found it difficult to find the MC31 we tried other foods.
4;Terrific Avocado Oil;Never used this product before and was interested in the fact that it was made with avocados (which I love). I certainly wasn't disappointed.
5;Great Tea!!;My sister-in-law brought some back from FLA and was rationing it out so I had to try it.  We could not find it in the stores here so I looked for it on Amazon.
5;Wonderful Dessert;These molasses like most Alwadi products are wonderful. Get a jar of the molasses and a jar of Alwadi tahini.
5;Our favorite grocery store chocolate chip cookie;This is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie, but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store. It is not too firm or soft, has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips, and makes for a nice snack or dessert.
5;Lite Fruit Pectin-great taste, low sugar!;I love this product! The directions were easy to follow, and my jam came out great! Best of all, I could make very fresh-tasting, fruity jam with very little sugar. Regular pectins need more sugar than fruit, which is bad for those of us with insulin resistance.
5;Breakfast with Eight O'Clock Coffee from Amazon;I just love this product.  Since I started buying it, everyone that I make it for, just loves it.
5;dog loves them;My dog loves the taste of these..
5;no more stale chips;i like nachos. i don't like stale chips.
5;Great Product;This cream of tartar is so fresh I couldn't believe the difference and I love that there wasn't any fillers in it. I recommend it highly.
5;Coconut Lovers Rejoice!;I am a lover of all things coconut.  Milk, water, oil, flesh and now butter!  This coconut butter is actually a lot like coconut oil, in that it contains coconut oil plus flesh, which makes it a soft, buttery spreadable condiment.
3;Contains CHICKEN;Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page.
5;Fantastic and easy to make;Absolutely delicious.  Every time we make these they're gone immediately.
5;super great... forceing my dogs wait till santa comes!;i got these in about 4-5 days after payment.<br /><br />i gave them one each when i got them.
1;only for seriously sweet coffee lovers;This coffee was WAY too sweet for me, I used one and I'm giving the rest to a good home.  By way of reference, I normally put a teaspoon of flavored creamer and 1-2 packs of splenda in a cup of coffee, so I do like mine doctored.
3;Fair;If you like a fairly strong ginger cookies, these are great.  They snap, they are spicy.
4;A sincere rating - I love it, but would improve it...;This is my favorite hot-sauce.  I want it to be a litter hotter though
5;treats;Great! I have a dog who is very allergic to lots of stuff and this is safe for him because of no grain corn wheat etc..
4;Good Things Come In Small Packages;For the money I thought that this plant was a bit small but it was in excellent shape, the pot was nice and it even had a bloom on it.  Customer service with this vendor could not be better.
3;No BAM for our buck;We have been trying out decafs to find good strong ones. I was so hopeful when I opened the box covered with exclamations of  'BAM!' and 'Oh Yeah, Babe!'.
5;Great Stuff;I come from a tropical country, Malaysia, so I know how coconut water straight from the tree tastes. I missed the taste ever since coming Stateside 6 years ago, and so I bought a 6 pack of Zico.
5;Best I have ever had;this product is the best cereal I have ever eaten. It is not only for the kids it is good for all whom like alittle sweet with there cereal.
5;Zooom;This stuff is perfect for a cloudy Monday morning when you really don't want to get up. It helps! Tasty stuff, very strong.
5;For the Coffee Hound;While I am no fan of coffee, other members in my household love it.  This got rave reviews.
5;McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal;I've been eating this oatmeal for around 4 years almost every morning with blueberries and bananas.  My Husband and I look forward to this and have more energy than when we miss it.
4;Bold Coffee Lovers - You'll Love This!;Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig coffees. I love a dark roast, full bodied coffee - and this one delivers.
4;Very refreshing and not too sweet;I must admit, I was hoping for something a little more sour than sweet.  The lime flavor is a bit mild for the margarita flavor I was expecting but it was still quite good.
5;Natural dog treats even humans can eat!;I bought these very cheaply through a lightning deal because I am always looking for tasty treats to spoil my puppies with. The package comes with 6 boxes and this is a lot of treats! Some treats are bigger, others smaller
5;happy customer;Very happy with the price and very fast shipping.  And as for the candy, yes yummy yummy yummy.
5;Incredible gluten-free find;My daughter is so limited in her snack choices so I sent all three flavors of this to her and she loves them all. She commented that they are more than a recovery drink, truly leaving her satisfied like eating a meal.
5;One of the best soups I've ever eaten;This stuff tastes awesome and it is completely healthy. It's the best soup from the Amy's line that I've tried.
3;Watch Out.  This Stuff Has a Real Kick!;Green tea?  Raspberry?  Acai?<br /><br />Sounds innocuous, doesn't it?  Do not be deceived.  This little drink packs an unexpected wallup.
4;Yum Yum Choclate and Rum!;Wow!  These little chocolates are great!  I bought this box to give as Christmas gifts.  I split the chocolates up and put them in little gift bags for folks in my office.
5;WOW!  That's some good espresso;I use this coffee in my espresso maker and all I have to say it WOW!  The espresso is smooth, with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish.  It's the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me.
5;Great Product;I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.
5;Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee;This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.
5;Judy's Candy Co. Peanut Brittle, sugar free.;Once again Judy's Company has come up with an amazingly great peanut brittle.  It is to die for! (Without the sugar and carbs.
5;Wonderful Breakfast Bar!!;These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day.
5;Very fresh, very strong, a bit much;After wasting a lot of money on tiny supermarket dill weed containers, I opted to try for a higher volume. Too high, I think.
4;Cats are finicky;"Subscribe & Save is great - sometimes our cats eat the ""seafood varieties"" sometimes they don't .."
5;Really nice snack.;These roasted peas taste really nice. They are crunchy peas half coated in a light batter of corn starch, flour, sugar and seasoning.
5;Good Stuff;I haven't been drinking coconut water for very long, but, I have tasted nearly every bottled brand out there and as of this review, this brand tastes as close to natural coconut as I have come. There is also another brand but I will write a similar review for that one.
1;Ordered 2 items, one was defective;I ordered 2 of these traps in the spring.  The mole runs tend to show up only in the late summer/fall where I live, and I finally opened them up to use them.
5;Great Treat for Newton;My dog, Newton, cannot get enough of these treats.  I can get him to do just about anything I want (ie, sit, lay down, rollover) by offering up a Buddy Biscuit.
5;Five-Star Rip Off!!!;I found out alittle too late..
1;Dissapointed;As other reviewers noted, more than dozen of items were broken, so the box was sticky and some of them still had creamer on them. Also the expiration date is June 2010 which less than 6 months away, I wont be able to use them before the sell by date.
5;Strong and Yummy! Doubles as an air freshner :);"This is only my second ever loose leaf tea. I now feel like I have been drinking second rate tea all these years! I put two teaspoons of the aromatic tea into my new ForLife Tea Infuser that I bought off Amazon as well, <a href=""http://www."
5;Review;I am a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products. The Company is terrific and so are its products.
5;Fantastic! So Happy!!!;Beautifully packaged in separate water vials. Flowers last 2 weeks.
5;Like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup;The chocolate peanut butter is decadent and really good and for 128 calories for the whole thing
2;Way to high !!!!!!!!!!! Price;I was just in Houston Texas and found these bottle for $1.29 each.
5;Yummy!;Great cookies.  Not overly sweet as most American cookies can be, with a hint of citrus.
5;Gotta love this candy.;Thanks, love this candy. Individually wrapped helps me control myself.
5;AWESOME!;I always loved snickers but after trying this almond version I am not sure I would go back to the original. This is so much better with almonds, I love these! If you love almonds you must try these, you will be hooked! Love the 2 pack too, good thinking.
5;Big suprise;These are pretty much the best chips i have ever eaten right above hot cheetoes. Try them and then try putting them down.
5;Fine but don't buy it at $35 + $7+ for shipping;This product can be had for $12 for two cans from other vendors. Don't get ripped off by the one seller offering it at shameful, ripoff prices here on Amazon.
5;Exotic, Floral-Flavored Vanilla Beans;"Tahitian vanilla beans don't taste at all like ""vanilla"" to me.  They impart an exotic floral flavor, that makes me think of flowers growing in a lush Tahitian rain forest."
5;Great Taste and Low Fat;Please ignore the negative reviews. They are way overdone to the point of hyperbole.
4;Yummy, but with a bit of an after taste.;This is a gluten free product.  I have never had a gluten free product nor do I have any medical need for one.
4;Puppy love;My dog loves these & I think our lawn looks better. Obviously I haven't tried them myself but the texture is nice and light.
3;"Classic ""cardboard"" taste";A picture of this crispbread should be in the dictionary next to the definition of cardboard. There are so many better products in the market today that I don't understand why someone would willingly purchase this product other than as an experiment (which was my case).
5;Organic beef jerky;This is my favorite beef jerky!!!  Typically BJ are so salty that I could not even eat it, but this one is not at all.  The BBQ flavor has just a mild kick that even my little 10 year-old can handle it.
5;MARY'S GONE ONION CRAKERS;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;You get what you pay for...;"I usually buy Annie's Fruit Snacks b/c they are sweetened with fruit juices - no sugar.  I decided to try these b/c they contain veggies, they were cheap, and I assumed that an apple company would sweeten their ""natural"" fruit snacks with juice, as well."
4;Toss in a nice olive oil with tomato and basil;Nice very thin angel hair pasta! Haven't had this since I went gluten free!<br /><br />Needs a little something something for flavor.  Cooks FAST.
5;lovely food product;nice product, nice product worth every penny and i most definitely needed it for my diet. a purchase that you couldnt get a better price for.
5;Very delicious!;I had never tried mochi before, so I was a little nervous. I've heard that sometimes Asian desserts can be a little strange if you are not used to them.
2;Too easy;This toy provided very little mental stimulation to my dog.  The treat is so exposed and extremely easy to eat off, and the bone so hard and ball so heavy he wanted nothing to do with it after the treat was gone.
5;Best tea ever!;I have been drinking Twining's English breakfast tea for years. It is strong, and satisfying.
4;Great taste but could do without oils;Shipped fast, tasted great, but could do without the hydrogenated oils that all K cup capps seem to have. Looking to try more flavors.
5;YUM!;While I love flavored coffees, I had never tried any of the Wolfgang Puck line.  This moved to the top of my favorites list with the first cup!  Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.
5;YUMMY!;I love these! They are a great snack and the milk cream inside is very creamy. It's nice to bite into the crunch of the cookie and then get that nice taste of cream inside.
2;Not my cup of tea.;I first had this company's tea in Seattle.  It is a little shop at the famous open air market, Pike's Place.
5;UMMMM!!!!!!;I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past.
5;Really NIce Sweetener;I have tried any number of substitute sweeteners (most of which are loaded with fillers and artificial stuff), especially stevia and xylitol. This is by far the best I have come across.
5;Best Price you will ever find;We all know Jack Link's is an excellent product. Dates were excellent and you will never find a better price anywhere so go ahead sign up for autoship and enjoy healthy protein anytime.
3;Great idea, flawed execution;I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.
5;Best;Best salt ever!  I like a variety of salts in my kitchen.  This is a wonderful addition.
5;Fall is in the air!;Fall is in the air, and this tea is perfect for the chilly nights.  I have one cup during the evening, so glad it doesn't have any caffeine to keep me up.
1;Allergies in a bag.;Science Diet, like Walmart brand Ol Roy dog food is made up primarily of corn and other known dog allergens. My last dog had so many health problems and allergies as a result of being fed nothing but SD.
5;Lactose and gluten free;Having never tried horchata before this, I can't really compare it to other brands.  It is a rice-based drink with a hint of cinnamon.
4;Very good product, high quality, but very expensive without a sale going on;"When I ordered this sauce for the first time, it was on sale, so I dared to jump in and give it a try.<br /><br />In case you are worried to mail order glass jars with sauce, don't be - they were professionaly wrapped in bubble wrap (I mean, really each glass individually, as they should), and these bubble-wrapped jars then are swimming in a sea of packing ""peanuts""."
5;Senseo Paris French Vanilla Bistro Coffee Pods;Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee pods are easy to use and easy to clean up. The pods brew a very flavorful cup of coffee.
5;Earthy and comforting;Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy.
5;Wasabi+Soy=AWESOME;The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.
5;Tuna, Taurine, My Cat Loves It;Thank You. I am very pleased.
5;the best tootsie roll has to offer;of all tootsie roll products, this one, hands down, is by far the best!  it is even better when mixed with other flavors..
5;really good;The wheatgrass  was legite. I needed this product for my cat and it came out perfect.
5;Acid buffering works wonders;I'm 6'7 with a very short torso, mostly legs. When doing weight training on leg days, I would literally get sick to my stomach after heavy leg presses.
5;For the adventurous tea drinker....;Numi teas have an enviable reputation in the American tea world:  they're known for being full-bodied and smooth, with good quality, clean leaves.  Numi's new organic Magnolia Puerh lives up to its promise.
2;Red flag - caused cough allergy;I was very happy with this product at first, as it solved my little dog's skin problems. Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy.
5;Great Waffles Better Pancakes;This is the best Pancake mix I've ever used.  My wife says they taste like IHOP pancakes.
1;Really nasty tasting stuff;I had heard a lot about coconut water and thought I would give this a try.  I wish I had tried a bottle locally rather than buying multiple bottles through Amazon.
3;Small bars of chocolate, but easy on the conscience;I wish they had shipped me the correct box of chocolate..
5;I found it!!!;I know I hadn't purchased this at the grocery store in a while. Much to my dismay they don't carry it.
5;Wonderful Brownies;We love The Cravings Place Ooey Gooey Chocolatey Chewy Brownie Mix.  They're very easy to make, and free of the most common allergens (gluten, dairy, eggs, soy and nuts), and just the right balance between chewy and cakelike.
5;As Close To Da Hong Pao/ Ta Hung Pao for the price as you can get.;This tea has a very strong aroma. Very chocolaty, colorful and thick.
5;Put on an automatic shipment;My roommate, an avid coffee lover has taken to this and asked I put it on automatic shipments for him.  Likes it enough that I'm going to order the decaf version to see if I can rekindle the Brit in me.
5;OVERPRICED;This is a great product and my cat goes crazy for it, but I just bought a 4 oz. bag of Bonito flakes at a local Asian store for $3.
1;EWWWWWWWWWW;This stuff is just awful. Doesn't taste like chocolate in the slightest.
5;My kids love it but I can get it for less at Target;My kids love this.  The first time I fed it to them they asked for another pouch.
5;Even finicky eaters will eat it!;My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).
5;Kibble size - 8 lb. vs. 16 lb. bag;UPDATE: No word on the kibble size, however the 16 lb. size lasted about 6 - 7 weeks for my Westie.
1;Beware if you are allergic to Phenylalanine;"This product does not state it is ""Low Calorie Sugar Free"" you only find out when it arrives.  There is a small yellow flag stating it on the box."
4;Good Garbanzos;These are tasty. They aren't mushy and aren't too hard, either.
5;Made my aunt very happy.;I sent this chocolate to my elderly aunt who was thrilled, as was her immediate family.  You would have thought that I sent her a bag of gold.
4;Nice product;Nice product and worth purchase. Seed less raisins, good for breakfast, adding in cakes.
5;My cat loves it;Finicky cat loves this flavor and stores locally do not stock it. She tends to leave many of the chunky bits but after having her turn her nose up and leave everything in her dish with other flavors it's clear she likes this cat food.
5;Wonderfully Tasting and Convenient;We are extremely pleased with the ease of use of the packs and the fact that it really is great tasting popcorn. Very few kernels went unpopped, so high quality and fresh.
5;tastey;Very good glaze to dress tomatoes or fish.  Saves using the really expencive aged balsamic.
5;Gevalia has the smoothest tasting coffees around;I have been a subscriber to Gevalia Coffee and tea products for over 10 years.  I started subscribing because of their flavored coffees.
5;Amazon is Perfect for Finding Hard-to-Find Items;On a recent trip to FL, I enjoyed Crystal Light On The Go Sunrise Classic Orange.  When I returned to Boston, I could not find the product in any of our local grocery stores.
2;Three dogs -- not much interest;I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors.
5;Thank you Amazon!;My family has traveled all over the world and Lavazza is the best coffee ever! Every time my friends go to Germany or Italy I have them pick it up for me. We were just running out and I happened to look on Amazon and there it was!!!!!!! This is great, I just bought 8 bricks and am going to buy more.
5;SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!!!!!!;"If you have a ""sweet spot"" for sweets and/or less than an iron will-then DON'T buy these.  That's right, put the mouse down and walk away now!  Why, you may ask?  Because these tasty morsels are the equivalent of fruity, chewy, delicious crack."
5;Best pretzels EVER!;If you like thin, salty and crunchy pretzels, these are the BEST! We originally found these in Costco but they don't carry them any more. Thank goodness for Amazon! When we found them, we had to order a case immediately.
4;Great food for the boys!;My dogs love this food and I also stay with it because there have been no recalls since I started using it. 4 star due to a little to expensive.
5;Teenie Weenie;My dog loves this treat. It helps clean his teeth daily since brushing is not an option because he dislikes it.
1;outragious price!!;$36 for 32 packs. Are you Kidding? The first packs I bought at BJS cost about $7.
5;reminds us of pakistan/indian;This is the only tea bags we get here in America, tastes like original Pakistani tea. You have to brew it correctly.
5;Wonderful Chocolate Flavor;This is the best chocolate tea I've ever had. I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate so I was skeptical initially, but I don't think it tastes like white chocolate particularly, just a great chocolate flavor.
5;Great price for superior forumla.....;"I have tried several varieties of dog food.  Most considered ""super premium"" types."
5;Just as good as sugar-laden puffs...and better for your kiddo!;Our daughter loves these puffs!  Our household is NOT all-organic by far, but compared to the other puff choices on the market, these were an easy choice.  They compare in price to the other sugar/sodium-laden puffs and are much healthier for your little one.
5;Best Andouille I have ever eaten.;I live in Wisconsin and Cajun food is hard to come by. My grocery store carries one brand but it is not the least bit spicy.
5;Partnership;Black carousel and K-cup B-60 sit side-by-side as good looking partners. Thirty-five count is large enough to last a week before refills.
5;Great taste!;We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.
5;awwwesom coffee;This coffee is awesome. It's pretty strong, so you can do the largest setting on the Kuerig and give yourself a 'warm up' by using the same K-cup and doing another shot through it with the small or medium setting and it still tastes great.
3;Pig ear review;I used to buy pig ears packaged by Hartz from Sams Club. They have not been available recently, hence this purchase The pig ears through Amazon are smaller, fewer to the package and far more expensive than the Sams product.
5;Great Egg Noodles;I was so happy to find these after eating at a German restaurant and sampling spaetzle noodles.  These work well in many dishes from soups to casseroles and the size of the box is (9 ounces)is a good size for two people.
5;Puzzled about the price;I agree with all of the positive comments.  I eat Grape-Nuts with raisins and I think that they are delicious.
5;Love these;"My dogs love these !!  When I ran out of them recently, they were ""counter"" sniffing trying to find some.  I have a service dog that has to maintain his weight, and these are perfect for him."
5;Best Mix;I grew up with this stuff but when I moved away from the East Coast I couldn't find it in normal grocery stores any more. I'm glad I found it online because it's well worth the shipping costs to get it.
2;Not for my kittens;My 6 month old kittens won't touch Wellness Kitten canned food.  I'm sure it's good for them but I can't get them to eat it.
5;Good stuff for celiacs;They don't make a Gluten Free cake mix better than this one. I love this one as well as the Spice Cake mix by Namaste.
5;Mmmmm!;I love Rice Krispies Treats and always eat far more of them than I should, they're just that good. They make a great snack for around the house and in kids school lunches.
4;Oh So Sweet!;This is a very yummy, sweet, healthy option for sugar. And I believe it is alchol free.
5;Kong treats;Use these treats with both the bone and the classic Kong toys.  My dog loves both the toys and the treats.
4;energy drink;The energy drink is a great product. The shipping price is crazy tho.
5;Great Coffee;Really a great cup of coffee.Rich and mellow, perfect for those who drink their coffee black.
5;Newman's Own pet food;I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.
5;Perfect for baby food;The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is perfect for freezing baby food.  I made my own baby food for my two children, and this is a simple way of getting it done quick and easy.
5;Muntons Premium Lager: Respectable Brew;My husband started brewing his own beer when he received a Mr. Beer in a gift exchange.
5;Crazy name;Crazy name but my dogs gobble them up.  Keeps them from eating my chair legs at least.
5;Thats a lota tea for the price!;I am not a Tea connoisseur but I have been drinking tea for about 20 years and I am happy with this product.  I mix peppermint tea in with my Yerba Mate tea and I got a nice blend.
5;Like a blueberry muffin;The first time I had this coffee, I swear I wanted to eat my coffee cup.  Just like a luscious blueberry muffin, especially if you add a bit of cream and sweetener.
3;Not as expected;"I thought this coffee would be a good substitute for the Starbucks roasted coffees, but not. The flavor was OK but did not get that ""roasted"" flavor found in the Starbucks coffees."
5;White Stevia 12 Oz Pwdr;Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.
5;Very flavorful - great product;I bought 2 packages of this.<br /><br />I love it!  Very flavorful.
4;Olden, No Longer Golden;"Amazon shipped these to me in September 09.  The label on each fig package clearly states ""Best Before 25 August 09""."
5;Monin Pomegranate syrup review;Very nice flavor and easy to use in other dishes.  I made pomegranate lemonaide and it was delicious.
5;Love this tea!!!;After getting the stomach flu my first week back to work, my milk production seriously took a plunge to almost nothing. I panicked and contacted my local La Leche League and they told me about this tea.
5;best on the market;Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement.
3;"Tastes Better Than ""5-Hour"", BUT Less Apparent Effect";I have mixed feelings regarding the Red Rain Evergy Shot (Berry Flavor).  It is about the same size and shape of every other energy shot bottle available.
3;Top is loose and doesn't poor freely;The O ring for the top does not seal properly with the pitcher and you have to tilt the pitcher more than other pitchers to get adequate flow.  This makes the top fall off and the potential for all the contents to spill out.
5;my dogs LOOOOVE these!!!;I have a dog that is allergic to chicken. It can be very difficult to find a product that is chicken free.
2;Maybe you like it, I don't;That Hain Celestial company that is manufacturing Health Valley and other brands has gone crazy of late, balancing purity with excess calories and lack of nutritional value. If you know anything at all about nutrition, and you review Hains other products, you will see the consistency.
3;Smells nice, works well in the shower to detangle.;I used this in conjunction with the Clear Scalp Shampoo.<br /><br />It might seem ridiculous to have some dandruff as well as oily hair.
5;Best tasting, most nutritious RTD out there;In order for me to get the nutrition I need, I have to supplement with protein and vitamins.  The taste of most powders mixed into water turn my stomach, so when I'm on the go, I turn to ready to drink (RTD) shakes.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.
5;Dogs love them;Good price. I'm not sure how they help with their teeth but my one dog just had teeth cleaned and just started giving these to her so will see if it's worth the price at the vet.
5;Amazing product for what you pay for it.....;I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.
5;Excellent product/price;The caviar is very good for the price and reflects what was described in their ad.  I plan on purchasing some higher end caviar for the holidays from Markys.
5;rockstar;Love the taste, esp at this price. Cheaper than at the store, and it comes to the door.
5;Fantastic;I have not bought A Taste of Thai Coconut Milk from Amazon but I do regularly buy it at my local grocer (when I run out though ..
2;Not quite sure about the five stars;I purchased this and the tea itself is nice. But if you want a full pot, you only get about 4-6 per can, which makes it pretty expensive.
5;Refreshing!;I am not a fan of coffee.  Sure, I'll admit that it tastes great.
5;Delicious cookies!;These are light and crispy and tart but sweet.  We originally ordered them in a fundraising catalog, and when they were gone, I had to hunt them down on the web.
2;Sadly did nothing;I was hoping this would be a natural un Cruel way to get rid of Mole problem on new lawn ..
1;Inconsistent in product quality;This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it.
5;Best Litter Ever!!;No blue dust here. Great litter: absorbs well
4;Very smooth, but does not taste like Ethiopian :(;"I ordered the Equal Exchange Organic Ethiopian Coffee after receiving a notice (prior to my subscription shipment) that the price had gone up on the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Nature Valley Roasted Nut Crunch;I am so glad Amazon offers this product.  Of all the Nature Valley bars, this is my favorite, very crisp and crunchy with great flavor.
4;Really good cookie, takes a little practice to get them just right.;"When making these cookies, I would change the directions given on the box by adding ""Wait until cookies are cool to the touch before removing from the cookie sheet""  Two minutes was not long enough to wait, and the first batch of cookies that I made crumbled into a tasty pile of crumbs.  Cookies tasted great, and had only mild aftertaste (a bit powdery, but not unpleasant)."
5;Great Variety of Vegetables;My baby loves this vegetable variety pack.  Also, whenever I introduce new foods to him, I mix it with a jar of sweet potato or carrots since they are his favorites.
5;Product Was Good for Gluten Free;Texture was acceptable.  Not too mushy.
2;Not a Fan;This brand has a sweet, almost maple syrup taste to them. Also, they don't whip up smoothly - they stay sort of shaggy looking.
4;Good flavor;I like the flavor of this coffee and drink it black.  My wife prefers it with cream and splenda.
5;Perfect snack, perfect size!;I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.
5;coffee;Coffee was tasty, and fresh. Came really fast.
5;GREAT for making coffee cake!!!;It has been tradition to make coffee cake with Solo Cherry my whole life.  For some reason it is very hard to find in the grocery stores lately.
1;Not recommended;These really tasted bad. I would not recommend them at all.
5;a godsend for infants!!;My 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance. She's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice.
5;The best CREAM of coconut I've found;I use coconut cream in Asian cooking - it adds a wonderful flavor to curries, Thai food and coconut rice.  Most of the products I've tried here in the USA are coconut milk or thinner, too-sweet versions of the cream of coconut.
5;Great coconut oil!;This is great coconut oil that we've been using for a year now.  We love using it for high temperature cooking (when olive oil and other oils are not appropriate to use) and also especially on our popcorn.
3;Not as good as gummi bears!;I had never tried these before but decided to order some along with my gummi bear fix. They aren't to my taste, just a little too sweet.
1;Inconsistancy;We have been buying Senseo Dark Roast for years.  Lately the quality has been varying - in batchA599269100 with a date of 11-24-12 - the resulting cups vary from great to watery.
5;Favorite thing about Brazil;I spent the first five years of my life in Brazil and my American parents both spoke Portuguese fluently and introduced me to Brazilian food and culture. This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil.
1;Broken Chips;These are great chips!  I also like the red chips.  UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy.
5;"The ""boys and girls"" loved them!";I have four dogs, two males and two females, of the Heinz 57 variety, all sizes and shapes, and they LOVE these treats!  Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.
4;N-E-S-T-L-E-S;Do you remember the old nestle jingle? n-e-s-t-l-e-s nestles' makes the very best..
4;Not bad refreshing gum;"I found the gum very crisp and refreshing. While the flavor doesn't last for a very long time, it lasts longer than most ""cheap"" gum."
3;not peanut butter but not bad;bought some at Walmart which was cheaper than on Amazon.com.
5;Best customer service ever.;Not only were these the best fortune cookies I have ever tasted, this company redefines what customer service should be.  SO many extra steps were taken to ensure that we recieved what we wanted, the order was customized not only to our requests but also to our timeline of when we were able to respond, etc.
5;Delicious!;This is the true English toffee: Sticky and chewy.  It has a distinct molasses like flavor (treacle).
5;Chacun a son gout;Funny, my sixty pound Staffordshire Bull Terrier adores these things. They are her favorite treat paws down.
4;A favorite, guilt-free snack;This is a great on-the-go snack that keeps the kids very happy! I agree with one reviewer that this product does not have a high nutritional value, but I still feel great about serving it to my kids. I like it more for what it does NOT have in it than for what it does.
5;Delicious!;"Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a ""sweet"" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies."
5;Awesome price, good product;Costco stopped carrying this near me, so when I found out it was on amazon for cheaper, I was so excited.<br /><br />It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I got from the Costco (no damage or anything).
5;Nice!;This mustard is a must. I enjoy it on sandwiches.
5;Um Um Good!;If you are in a dwelling with a dog you soon realize that there is not an infinite variety of food available.  You hope to find something the dog likes.
5;canidae excellent!!!!!!!!;This dog food is the best!! Excellent price. Free shipping, and above all high grade quality ingedients.
5;Tasty and healthy;We discovered these as one of the snacks sent by a diet my husband was on.  They're good enough we then looked them up ourselves.
5;Fabulous sauce;I took a cooking class in Tuscany two years ago and discovered this product in class.  So easy to impress your friends.
2;Weak flavor, can barely taste any vanilla;very diappointing flavor.  I thought Timothys made fine coffees, but skip this one.
5;Great tea that is also good for you!;The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.
1;Beware.... sudden change in product;We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning.
3;Interesting pb;Not good on sandwiches or oatmeal. Good for cooling with.
5;good buy;It's the same good product I've been buying in one ounce containers, and this amounts to about half price.  I do wonder at the size of the jar, which is only about half full.
5;I can't belive amazon has this!!;It was a long shot checking to see if Amazon carried this, but they did! I read some of the reviews and saw that most people were complaining about the expiration date. I ordered some, received it within 4 days, and upon checking the exp.
3;Disappointing;I do not know why some of these companies have to mess with a good thing.  I used to enjoy this cereal all the time and I loved how it didn't give in to the sugary sweetness of the other cereals.
1;No Fun for Violet;Our Airedale Violet liked the idea at first. I sat on the floor with her and introduced her to the ins and outs of it.
3;Solidified Vials;I really like this stuff but was a little annoyed that in 2 of my vials the product had solidified.  I don't know if water got in there or what but I got less than I paid for.
4;Tasty when heated;I buy them from Walmart. Extremely small, nothing like the commercial, but what can you expect for 90 calories and a 20% dv of fiber.
5;Quick and easy;When you need a quick snack, try these.  In about 90 seconds it is ready.
5;Death by Chocolate?;These are AMAZING. Easy to make and by far the best boxed brownies you could ever try! They are so thick, heavy & moist.
5;love Gluten free Mama!;This flour is wonderful!! Gluten free mama's website is great and you can find easy and tasty recipes. The hamburger buns are a family favorite.
5;Sanity in a tea bag, Hooray!;This is the best, much better than Yogi tea.  I really look forward to this tea.
4;Good snack food;THe chips taste great i love them, the only problem i have witht hem and this i why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the chips are kinda small and some times its like eating crumbs because they get smushed easily. OTherwise the chips are great.
5;WOW!;This is the BEST canned enchilada sauce ever.  I USED to make homemade sauce which took about 8 hours from beginning to end.
5;Best sardines I've found;Season sardines are the best I've ever tasted. I particularly like the whole sardines in olive oil, but other varieties I've tried are also good.
5;thank you!;Serving milk thistle seed in your diet are a nutritious way of adding both taste and nutrition while improving the health of one's liver.  And, my budgie likes the germinated seeds as well.
5;A delightful filled candy;I had an urge for filled candy around Christmas and found these at a local grocery store.<br /><br />  They are delicious with a tender shell around a chewy, gummy center.
5;Love it!!!;I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here.
4;Pretty tasty, and not your usual *Newton* cookie;These are very different from the old model Fig Newton cookies we grew up with, very crispy and no filling. You can smell the blueberry as soon as you open the package (which is very easy to open and seal back up again).
4;yummy;i love fruit syrups on pancakes and waffles. plum syrup is impossible to find, so i was delighted to find this.
5;Best Gluten free pre-baked cookies!!;I have known about being a celiac for about 5 years and have tried several products.  As we know, baking at home is the safest but, sometimes we want to be like other people and be able to 'grab a snack'.
5;Better than Girl Scout cookies!;These are even better than Girl Scout cookies and most likely healthier.  If you are into weight watchers.
4;Tasty but for this price, I should learn to make it myself;I love this product, been buying it in my local store for a couple of years. It's becoming harder to find, but I'm not sure I'm ready to pay this much for it, in bulk no less.
5;GREAT FLAVOR AND SUGARFREE;"I bought these for my daugther when she quit smoking.  She ""loves"" them!  True butterscotch flavor, sugarfree, perfect size (says other hard candy is too large) and an added plus, they are ""gluten-free"" so she can have them in her candy dish for her ""allergic"" friends."
5;great coffee;So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.
5;Best sports drink for cycling;Been around for a long time and used by many serious cyclists.  The orange is great now with stevia (vs aspartame) and caffeine.
5;Great Product;After reading reviews, I decided to try this coffee. Little nervous, but worth a shot for the price.
1;Weakest, worst 'French Vanilla' coffee i've ever tasted!;As a longtime avid fan of vanilla flavored coffee, I was excited about trying this brand of 'French Vanilla' on our new Keurig machine. In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible.
1;I love ginger snaps...;..
5;Great soup starter!;I have used both the Beef and chicken soup mixes from Mrs Grass for years to make a nutritious home made soup. When Walmart stopped carrying it for sale I looked on the 'net to see where I could get it.
3;Good product, poor quanitity.;I love the product, but I think that it is a bit too pricey. The cans are barely over half full so we go through them very quickly.
4;A tasty chai!;I'm always looking for a good chai, and I'm kinda picky about it since I really don't care for anything that tastes like licorice.  Many chai blends include star anise, which ruins it for me.
2;Didn't like at all!;I was really excited to try this, thinking it was actually going to taste like a dark chocolate hot drink. I was sorely disappointed.
3;Mini Candy Canes for Valentine Cards;It was very fortunate that there were 280 because 118 of these candy canes arrived broken. They came in a plastic bag wrapped once with bubble wrap and not in the container shown.
5;The Best Hot Sauce in the World;I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.
1;Vegeta, Gourmet Seasoning, No MSG;I was glad that Podravka made a new, improved Vegeta without MSG. Unfortunately they substitute MSG with two other flavor exchangers, Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate, who are leading to the same harmful effect to our bodies through their by-products, just like MSG.
5;Rich, Robust Flavor, and other good stuff, too.;"The following are quotes from the box of Marley Coffee 15 Count Single Serve Pods:<br /><br />""Ethically Farmed. Artisan Roasted."
5;Wonderful as always;
5;Whamlicious;We have had wham before and everyone we introduce it to raves about it.  It seasons just about anything from steaks to shrimp to chili.
5;Delicious!;My boyfriend and I recently moved to the US and were very disappointed by the American style chorizo (yuck!). We decided to try ordering some stuff online and wow this product is probably one my best purchases ever! At first we bought three sausages - then once they were gone we bought five that we are currently working our way through.
4;good health food;Not very sweet, but extremely chocolate.  Got these bars with a gift certificate and not sure I would pay my own money for them, but they are indeed superior quality.
5;Everyone loves it;I buy this tea in bulk because I drink it at work (beats the heck out of bad office coffee) and everyone who smells it wants to try it.  I have had the other version (spice chai) and love that this tea is also made in the double spice version.
2;Too much of the same masala, unhealthy;It seems like they are starting to use the same masala in a variety of substances that it renders it indistinguishable from the other items. this is a common problem in restaurants outside of india.
5;Not too soft, not too sweet...just right;I really love these new & very different cookies.  They are crisp yet chewy, not extremely sweet like most cookies.
4;I like it!;I like the smell and the consistency. I have colored hair and my hair gets oily, but the ends are like straw.
5;My cat LOVES these;Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY..
5;Great GF Cereal!;This is a great cereal for children and adults. It has very little sugar (5g) but still tastes sweet and crunchy.
4;A healthy little snack that actually tastes good!;Hi!<br />Thee are a new entry by Nabisco - instead of the thick and soft fig newtons (and later other flavors), they have gone in different direction with these. These are crisp thin cookies, (more like a wafer) with real fruit bits in them.
4;Fun for the whole family;Though a little pricey for the size (reason for 4 stars), this was a fun item to buy.  We had a great time on Christmas daring all of the family members to eat the different flavors that come in the boxes.
4;Nice Gift;My brother and his wife liked it very much they thought it was a nice basket.  Easy gift when you don't know what to send.
5;Love this red rice;My husband and I love this rice.  We mix it with brown rice.
5;coffee pod drawer;THE DRAWER HOLDS MORE THAN A CAROUSEL. yOU CAN ALSO ARRANGE THEM BY FLAVORS DOING COLUMN BY COLUMN.
5;NICE!!!;Usually drink the French Roast but found this to be smoother & richer.  Hope to continue buying if I can get it at a decent price.
5;I'm loving it;I drink this delightful raspberry tea year-round (un-iced in the winter), and was delighted to find it online, and less expensively than in the one store that I know carries it.  Also I discovered I could subscribe, receiving it at regular intervals by mail, which means I no longer have to make an extra stop, since the store that carries it is not where I normally trade.
4;sub-optimal packaging &lt;
5;Perfect;I've been trying all the different flavors of K-cups and this one is my favorite so far.  Good enough to stop looking.
5;Better Than Homemade!;Bisquick is the best baking mix on the market, and provides a good start for pancakes and crepes.  I like the 7.
5;Great chips;These chips are delicious. The chips arrived early which worked out perfect for us.
5;Tea Time;I was looking for a organic black tea to replace the Tetley tea I usually drink.  This Stash tea was it.
5;Best dog food ever;I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and he has been on Wellness Core for about 4 weeks.  His coat has never looked or felt better.
5;Best in Class Dry Dog Food;Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars)
1;A BIG MISTAKE !;I sampled the product when I received it and was disappointed to say the least.  I threw the entire order in the trash.
2;No Super Saver = Very Disappointing;This product would be worth buying on Amazon if Super Saver applied but it does not.  Without SS the total price is almost the same as if ordered from Herrs' site.
4;Nice Flavor!;These have nice flavor.  You can really taste the pomegranate.
2;Unfortunately, now it is junk;I have been a huge fan of Andy Capp hot fries for over 10 years now.  Unfortunately, for the past year now, they have really sucked.
5;Excellent quality & taste;These sardines have the right amount of smoke, and the olive oil packing really rounds out the excellent taste. They are a perfect size and well worth the premium price over Crown Prince One Layer Brisling Sardines.
3;Different, but not necessary;I usually dip my french fries in some ranch dressing, occasionally also mixed with hot sauce.  Some of you may find that disgusting.
4;Good Conditioner;I liked the way this conditioner made my hair feel but I'm not sure if it did much for my scalp. At the price of the conditioner, it's certainly a value for what you're getting.
1;What the #@$%%?;I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the 0 Calorie description.  I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch (or dressing for that matter).
5;Enjoyable brisk cup of tea;Barry's Tea is a ground tea not a leaf tea. You can only get one cup of tea from each spoonful.
5;Teeccino Herbal Coffee;Teeccino Herbal coffee is very tasty. Add chocolate liquid stevia, and it makes it even better.
3;Not bad;It's not bad, the quality of the noodles is excellent, the packet comes with a good amount of flavor powder so you can pick how hot you wanna make the noodles. The full packet is pretty spicy, half the packet is better for my taste.
4;Good Kona coffee;Bought this to work with my Keurig (self-fill cups) and wanted a Kona coffee.  It's good, but not the same as the Lion coffee that is the other Kona coffee I drink.
5;Only One For Me;This is the only k-cup I use. I think the flavor is just right - however, I add creamer and sweetener to ALL coffee.
2;Beautiful Waffles - terrible aftertaste!;I made my first batch of waffles from this mix this morning.  They smelled wonderful while they were being made - and tasted great - but now I have an awful aftertaste in my mouth that just won't go away.
5;Best espresso ever!;I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home).
5;Love these snacks!!;These are great whether you're looking for a lowfat snack or are on a gluten-free diet.  They retail for $2.
5;Good Breakfast cereal;I bought this box of dark chocolate almond granola cereal and it is very good. I eat it for breakfast every morning and with this product I can eat a healthy bowl of cereal everyday.
5;Sweet and flavorful;I drink mostly water every day, so was looking for something to change it up that had some flavor but that was also decaf.  These little tubes of Lipton to-go stix decaf iced green tea mix are convenient, and tasty.
5;Best chip ever;I saw these at the store and became addicted to them.  They are very light to eat, and very tasty.
4;Healthy!;This product was purchased mostly because of the health benefits and for the sake of curiosity.  The matcha is the prominent flavor here, which is great since the matcha is of a good consistent quality, just like all of Red Leaf's matchas.
3;Bad Batch of Tomatoes;I have been using Tuttorosso Crusted Tomatoes for years, never had a problem wouldn't use any other brand. My family thinks I am crazy but the last couple of batches of gravy (yes I call it gravy not sauce) taste different to me.
5;Great for training, dog loves these!;My 4-month chocolate lab loves these! I like the tiny size of the treat because believe me, treats pile on the weight! I got Salmon ones because I figured that the Salmon oil in the treats may be good for his skin and coat but seriously, they are stinky. I keep them with all his other treats and if I've forgotten to seal the bag, the whole cabinet starts smelling! They do harden up if you've left the bag open.
5;jolly rancher watermelon;i have always liked jolly rancher's.I would reccommend this candy,to whoever likes hard candy.
4;OK, but not as good as Celestial Seasonings version (not available);Bought this when I could no longer get (the wonderful) Celestial Seasonings Cool Brew (mint + green tea).<br /><br />This is an acceptable alternative, but I do prefer the CS version.
5;Why is this tea not famous and widely available?;You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners.
4;Mars Bars;These were good, but not like Mars Bars in the U.S.
5;Indulgent Flavor, Practical Price;We drink a LOT of coffee at my house, especially since my parents bought us a K-Cup machine. Combine that with the hand-held milk frother we bought on Amazon and it's like having a coffee shop steps from your couch! As a result, we go through a lot of cream, sugar, flavoring, etc.
1;Disgusting!;I bought a bag, opened them, and almost threw up because of the overpowering rancid oil (and chemical?) smell!  Of course, I didn't dare eat one of the cookies, nor did I want to because I was so nauseous from the odor!  I couldn't even dispose of them in my kitchen trash can
2;wrong size;I ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs.  My dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.
1;You've got to be kidding me!;Where did they get the picture for the front of the box? Certainly not from their own product--it doesn't look anything like the picture. A very disappointing product from a taste and texture point of view as well.
4;A good hardy cup of coffee;I am about to make my third order for Timothy's World Coffee, Columbian Decaffeinated for Kuerig brewers. It is a consistent cup of hardy coffee at a very competitive price.
5;Pig Ears;I am totally satisfied with the pig ears I received.  They are large and my dog loves them!  I refuse to purchase food items for my pets that come from outside the USA and was pleased to find these available.
1;Don't order from Amazon!;My dog loves this food and when I saw it here on Amazon AND Prime Eligible I figured it would be any easy way to get her food - no more trips to the pet store. I'm not sure if the bag sat in a hot warehouse for a while or what happened, but the food STANK.
5;I love Hills!;My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.
4;Good Sunflower Seeds for the Price;For about a dollar a bag, this is a good deal to buy sunflower seeds in bulk.  Good flavor in the seeds and each bag lasts a decent amount of time.
2;Not much taste;Not a strong taste of either vanilla or Rooibos. I've tried three other Rooibos teas, and they all taste better than this one.
5;A bar that bites back!;Xocolatl is a blend of 74% cacao, nibs and chillies that tastes like no chocolate I've ever had before.  It's got a South of the Border flavor that cannot be beaten, but is not for the faint of heart.
3;Sweet but sometimes a little sour;I was suprised to see how it changed things from sour to sweet. If you're looking for something fun to do at your next party or even just at work, give this a try, it's amazing! We ordered the miracle berry tablets, after hearing about them on an early day gossip, for our birthday party.
5;It has an awesome taste when I....;I bought two boxes and ate the first three bags as is, but did not like it.  BUT, when I added Kernel Seasonings' Nacho Cheddar it became delicious.
2;Not what it says;My main issue with this product is that i received the old formula with the old label. I wanted to try fast twitch because it was apparently caffeine free.
5;Delicious!;Metromint water is delicious.  Goodberrymint is very tasty and I love that it has no additives and no sugars- real or artificial.
5;Too good - my wife couldn't stop eating it;Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she absolutely, totally loved it.  She couldn't stop eating it.
5;It's the Cats' Meow;This is one of the best products that we have seen.  Our inside cat, Snowball, prefers this over anything else.
4;coconut in the morning?;I did not know this had a coconut flavor or aroma as I got it in a variety pack. I put it in this am and immediately smelled coconut and thought oh no I don't like sweet in the AM.
5;My son loves this;My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.
5;Best Organic Infant Formula for a great price;Before I decided to purchase this product I looked around who has the best price and the winner was here. None of the other stores online and physical once had this Infant Formula for an affordable price.
4;gimbal's sugar free black licorice chews must be made in the middle east!;Last year I purchased Gimbal's Fine Candies Sugar Free Black Licorice Chews in the 10 pound case TWICE.  The cost with free shipping was $46.
5;Best soy milk because it is so easy to use, store, and tastes great;I use this straight into my coffee like a creamer, I mix it up for drinking, I use it for creamed sauces..
5;Sabroso!;As a first generation American, I tend to long for the Dominican dishes my mom used to cook.  To get the authentic flavor, Sazon Goya is without rival.
5;Yummy!;These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy.
5;Amazing;This oil is completely amazing. I use it all over! I use it in my hair ever so often to keep it soft and hydrated, my lips as a balm and my whole body as a deep moisturizer.
3;Javapodz Don't Fit in Senseo;Just received my order of 2 boxes of 10 podz each. I bought Columbian Supremo.
3;Delicious soda, ridiculous price;MacFuddy's is delicious! It's like an enhanced Dr. Pepper in my opinion.
3;Great product but the subscription ships old products.;I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe.
1;Horrible!  Yuck!!;This mix is a total waste of money.  First of all, they make the mix sound really low-calorie, but the directions call for heavy cream.
5;Taste great and convenient;This is my favorite drink.  Better than plain coffee.
5;Super taste sensation, not too hot, but spicy enough for children to crave;If you cannot tolerate extremely hot spicy chips, but like some zing with the crunch then these chips are made for your enjoyment. I purchased these around the holidays and they were truly enjoyed by many guests.
5;Zatarain knows New Orleans;Love this item. I usually just add 1 lb of a variety of sausages and in about 30 minutes I have a awesome New Orleans style meal.
5;Once you learn how to mix it.....;Once you learn how to mix it, not half bad. You must mix with some fruit juice like Apple or White Grape.
4;Doggy Loves It!;..
4;coffee pod;trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent.
5;Yummy;My mom loves them as do I and this is not something she will buy for herself because shipping is never cheap. However I wanted to get them for her anyway and she was happy, they were yummy buttery and soft.
5;Great Coffee!;Great Deal on the 2 bags, and the coffee is superb.  Strong, yes, but tastes amazing in a french press.
4;Bigelow Tea for Keurig Brewers;Rich, bold, flavorful tea which brews stronger through the Keurig Brewing System than through regular tea bags.  Great for on-the-go.
5;Superlative;McCann's is absolutely the best oatmeal available.  The packaging is brilliant
5;Love it!;Purchased these while in Scotland in 2009.  Been drinking them ever since.
5;WONDERFUL alternative to regular salt!;Such a wonderful alternative to regular salt. My family will never go back to it.
4;good;My dog loves these so I order them occasionally to diversify her treats. NOrmally, I prefer to buy freeze dried beef treats for her - they hold their shape better than the chicken treats.
5;THE American comfort cheese;Great chesse to make snacks with. Melts so easy and has a wonderful flavor.
5;Awesome Dog Food;I guess you do really get what you pay for!<br />It's expensive but top quality. There is a huge difference between this and any other dog food.
5;coconut oil;Read the facts on coconut oil. You won't go back to synthetics, made with fuel oil, unless of course you own stock in the company.
5;Love these bars;Great crunch and taste.  Love the auto ship program with discount!  I can't find these in any stores in my area, was so happy to get them on Amazon.
1;Doesn't suck, and doesn't kill mosquitoes any more;I have used the Cutter for about four years, and other than having trouble getting it to siphon, the poison worked very satisfactorily. In the past week, I sprayed my grand daughter's yard, and my yard, at HUGE concentrations, and the mosquitoes have laughed at the poison and eaten me alive.
5;A Perfect cup of Tea;I tasted Souchong tea several years ago and became a fan.  I have not been able to locate it in local stores.
4;Great Tasting Coffee Drink;illy is renowned for their coffee, and this version did nothing to tarnish that image. It has a well balanced taste, and I could clearly taste the coffee and chocolate.
5;Love the bergamot flavor!;One thing I like about Stash teas is the packaging. Each bag is sealed in a foil pouch which retains the tea's flavor.
4;Fine Chai Spice Tea---Without the Caffeine!;****<br />This is a decaffienated version of Stash's chai spice tea, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea.
5;It's key-lime-time!;If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor.
4;better than a chew toy;I needed something for my young dog to chew on besides her toys and my vet suggested these.  I orginally purchased the beef flavored but opted for these because the flavored have an odor.
4;Not as sweet;I do enjoy this product but it is not as sweet as I would prefer.  It does not have to be Nutella sweet but I can almost feel saltiness which I don't like.
4;Works per advertised;Right amount of caffeine to wake you up.  Flavor and strength are fine too.
5;Love These;I take these shopping every week. I was a little worried how they would hold up.
1;Knock off Danish cookies!;This is not the true Danish brand for sugar cookies. The sugar crystals looked and tasted like sand granules.
5;Cheers Tony!!;I discovered this seasoning while searching shopping one day. I was looking for another seasoning and realized I own a few dozen hot sauces but basically no pre-made seasonings.
5;Delightful surprise at the airport store!;Was waiting for our airplane & wanted something healthy to snack on - to my delightful surprise, I found your product (Multigrain one), looked at all the numbers on the back of the package & was amazed how good they were
5;BEST BBQ sauce ever!;I've tried most of the Korean BBQ sauce out there and this one is the BEST by far!<br />This is my recipe using this sauce on some chicken thighs & drumsticks.<br />Starting out with 5 lbs of chicken, wash and let dry.
1;Food NOT smooth at all!!!;I was super excited to get this since I was putting my veggies in a steamer basket in a pan on the stove top. Steaming the veggies and then putting them into the blender to make them into baby food.
5;Gor the gluten free eater...;I purchased these for my daughter who has had alot of difficulty with eating any type of wheat products without incapacitating abdominal pain. She has been craving cereal for the longest time and these flakes have really satisfied her cravings.
5;Great snack with or without dip.;These chips are great by themselves or with salsa, pico de gallo, cheese dip, sour cream dip--probably any dip you like.  They have just enough salt, but not too much.
5;I love it;I love this chocolate covered cookies. The chocolate is pure and tasty.
5;Use it in all my Paleo recipes;"I've always been a fan of Bob's Red Mill flour ever since I've been cooking.  About six months ago, I switched to a ""paleo"" gluten-free (and mostly grain free) diet, and as such, I needed something to fill in the gaps where I historically would've been using wheat flour."
5;Nothing beats Kookaburra on a fishing trip!;A good trout fishing trip starts with a couple of bags of Kookaburra..
5;Delicious Duplex Cookies!;These organic cookies are absolutely delicious! The chocolate tastes rich and not overly sweet, and this is balanced nicely by the vanilla half. The nutrition facts and ingredient list are the icing on the cake - so much better for you than Oreos and just as good (if not better) tasting.
5;You Can't Eat Just One....;12 Bags, with a six month expiration date
5;Tasty Snack;"I got the Sour Apple version of the Clif Kid Twisted fruit, and even though I'm not a ""Kid"" exactly, I still take these to work for lunch.  They do taste good."
4;Pretty good, if you have the right brewer;I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.
5;Bobbys Favorite !;I feed these to my cat, Bobby every night. They are good for him, he loves them and they have no cat food smell.
5;G.M. Caramel Vanilla Cream K-cups;I am not fond of most flavors of K-cups.  However, the G.
5;Best German Noodles - Ever;I bought these noodles for my German husband and he loved  them.  They are giant and delicious.
5;great;very delicious product. fresh and is good to feed toddlers if you wan't.
5;Best brand for Thai red curry;This is my favorite brand of Thai red curry paste.  We use it to make thai curry at home, because it's soooo simple to make.
1;def more like cat food - baby did not like at all;I don't see how there can be good quality salmon in this or lentils..
5;Best  Tea ever;I can't buy locally so amazon is my go to place.<br />This is my favorite tea ever, if you like licorice<br />flavored anything, you will really enjoy this tea.
5;Roland Balsamic glaze is great for summer salads.;I find I use these glazes more in summer on ripe tomato<br />salads of all kinds. I like the flavor of Roland over others<br />that I have purchased.
5;Quick Delivery, just what I ordered;Can't find these things anywhere in the grocery stores in the decaffeinated variety. Shipping was fast and my handicapped Mom didn't have to go to store after store looking for them.
4;I gave this to my 12 yr old to try;He said he liked the taste of it, but it kept him up half the night.  I guess it did what it claimed then!  He has not asked for me to buy more though.
1;Sorry, just didn't like it!;I usually love STASH teas, but this one is undrinkable.  I really tried to like it and tried it multiple times.
5;good light coffee flavor;If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.
2;Disapointed.;Although, the chocolate was good, and the inside was very creamy
2;Beware of possible damaged goods;Well, this is frustrating as I really love this product for making decent quality lattes on my home machine. However, this is the second time in a row where the product has arrived damaged with cartons opened/punctured with leaky milk.
5;Fantastic Flavor;A perfect combination of bergamot and tea. Full bergamot flavor.
4;will the real manhattan chowder fans please stop laughing !;"wow , i thought i had read some pretty funny reviews but some of these review points take part of the cake !!<br />manhattan or otherwise called "" old fashioned"" clam chowder is not .."
2;These are terrible!;I love raspberry and chocolate and was very excited to find a healthy alternative for my brownie fix. I was sorely disappointed in the taste.
5;A delicious jarred salsa;"Being that I really like chips and salsa, I have tried lots of jarred salsas, and most of them are completely soul-killingly horrible (I'm looking at you <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Really Tasty;I frequently get raspberry coffee from dunkin' donuts but started needing to cut costs.  I saw this and got excited as I hadn't found a replacement for dunkin' donuts.
5;cheddar crackers;These taste like the cheddar crackers of years gone by.  Back before all the bad additives were added to good food.
2;Nothing grew;After 2 months of no activity, I dug into the soil and found 1 seed.  Have they ever heard of the law of large number?  How stingy do you have to be to just have 1 seed.
5;This Stuff Is A Winner..;These days, with so many energy products coming at you a mile a minute you never know what to expect. I was won over right away by the taste.
5;AWESOME;These chips are extremely tasty, very good snack! I wasn't sure I would like them but was pleasantly surprised.  I had the Sour Cream and Chive, they are out but I enjoyed them so much I think I will try another flavor.
5;Nice Flavor;This has a really nice flavor.  Would not hesitate to buy it again but probably not from Amazon or its vendors as they are overpriced.
5;Savory choice is great;Almost hate to review as they may run out again.  I've gotten several friends using it too.
5;Best brand out there...;I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.
5;Awesome Taste;Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee --with a hint of flavor (coconut). Full bodied, and no after taste, Jamaica Me Crazy is just what I love for an afternoon pick-me up, or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face.
5;Timothy's Coffee;Timothy's World Coffee Italian Blend is a smooth, meduim coffee. I have tried other brands and they seem bitter compared to this.
5;Love this mix - great price too;This is a great mix and very convenient.  Makes great cookies in a hurry, especially when I am out of the base ingredients.
2;Reasonable But Not Great;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Thats Cheese for yah';I think this was a dud purchase, Mum has yet to elaborate further then
3;Delicious Alternative!!!;I have always preferred these to regular flamin hots. They taste better and i feel better about eating them.
1;"They keep sending me Dacaf ""Light Roast"" coffee!";"This is not Decaf ""Extra Bold"". Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product."
5;Productivity juice;Really perks me up and helps me be more focused and productive. 0 calories and actually tastes decent.
5;Amazing!;I absolutely love PB2!  I'm not really fond of it as a peanut butter replacement in a sandwich, but it is wonderful when used as a mix-in for peanut butter flavor.  My favorite ways to use it is mixed into oatmeal, low-fat vanilla ice cream, pancakes, protein shakes or greek yogurt.
5;Most versatile olive oil.;This is by far my favourite olive oil. I used it in a restaurant i worked in, and loved it so much, i started getting it at home.
3;Not too bad;Product had a good fruit taste, but the cabonation gave it a twangy taste to it.  Cold it's like a soda.
5;Freaking delicious;"I love these.  I'm not sure they count as ""healthy"", since they do have like 200 calories apiece and a fair bit of fat, but they claim to have a very low glycemic index (probably because of the nuts), so that's something."
4;Great stuff!;The spicy thai beef jerky makes for a quick high-protein snack between meals. I would give it five stars if there weren't some tough, unchewable pieces in every bag.
4;Nice Source of Protein;This is a great source of protein if you are trying to get protein but want to avoid chloresterol.  you might find it needs a little salt but that is typical of beans.
1;My dog loves everything, but hates this.;I wasted my money.  I tried putting different cereal, dog foods, etc.
5;Best for Dogs!;I didn't know what these were until I visited my friend who had them laying around the house for her dogs. My dog grabbed it and just chewed away forever and I had to ask her where she got it and what they were.
4;Yummy tea, some bags more potent than others;I love this tea.  Its flavor is usually super potent (cinnamon and orange), although some of the 50 tea bags (which I store in a glass jar in my freezer) are more potent than others.
4;Light, delicious;This is a lovely tea that is both full bodied and light at the same time. The tea is not bitter, and thus avoids a common problem I've encountered with Numi teas in the past.
3;Not the best pod!;I was disappointed by this pod. The coffee is weak.
5;Very engaging;This is the first morning my dog is using this toy. So far, it seems great.
5;Yummy!;I have tried other flavors of the Campbell's Soup at Hand and did not like them.  To me they do not taste like the soup they are supposed to be duplicating, nor did they have the same texture.
5;Truvia;My diet calls for me to cut out sugar. With Truvia I can do it without losing the sweet taste of the drinks or fruits that I enjoy.
5;Worked for me!;I had to drive 500 miles and the drive began late in the day when I was already tired and on a full stomach from lunch.  Needless to say I was feeling a bit drowsy.
5;Great flavor, great price!;I've purchase Natural Calm regular flavor from my chiropractor. Imagine my surprise to see a bottle twice the size at a lower price.
4;works well, smells nice;Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn't smell like an anti-dandruff product. I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don't think it's any more effective than Head & Shoulders (same active ingredient).
5;DELICIOUS!;I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower.
5;Excellent product just when I needed it;We needed a high quality wet cat food to help our sick kitty get his appetite back, put on some weight, and get him into recovery. He had turned up his nose at a great many foods, including the expensive Rx stuff from the vet we were told no cat could resist.
5;Always Organics;I have been buying Farmer's Market organic butternut squash at my local supermarket for the past year. It wasn't always available when I shopped there so finding it on Amazon.
4;Light taste, saut&eacute;
4;Good, but has a different behavior than traditional 3-way mixes..;I've used this product (a mcpa, dicamba, triclopyr mix) for several years now, and I find it has some pros, and some cons compared with a traditional 2,4-d/mcpp/dicamba mixes (and possibly newer mixes). Loving it or hating it will depend on your weeds.
5;Excellent;Awesome coffee!!! I have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third. If you like dunkin donuts hazelnut, but don't like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative.
5;delicous snack for picky kids;These are very good and good for you.  A full serving of fruit and not like the other fruit snacks you buy.
5;Best Packaged BBQ Sauce Out There;This is by far the best store bought BBQ sauce I've ever had.  I am fortunate that they sell this in the stores near me.
5;Spice Island Hickory Smoked Salt;I have used this product for many years.  It's great for grilling steaks or hamburgers.
5;Wonderful for nausea.;Last year an internet search on home remedies for nausea/indigestion lead me to try simmering peeled, minced fresh ginger.  I was thrilled with how well it worked and how quickly.
5;NOM NOM NOM;These turkey snacks are really good.  I am glad that I found a good snack that I can take to football game parties.
5;long time  espresso lover;This  espresso is finely ground  so be sure you have an  appropriate espresso machine to get the best  from this  coffee. I find the flavor wonderful  just like the espresso  I have had in Europe.
3;Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce;You know when you are making a burrito and you want something saucy..
5;Best Tea Ever;Good Earth sets the standard for excellent tea with their 'original sweet & spicy'. It is a bonus that it is a herbal tea and has no caffeine.
2;gave it away;Ive never tried kc bar-b-q so i didnt know what it was going to taste like. When i finally got it i took one bite and eewwwww not the greatest taste.
2;Cappaccino?;"It tastes the same as the first original ""International Instant Coffee"". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino."
4;Good vermicelli, but cooking instructions are incorrect;My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli, and it turned out quite good. Noodle strands were separate (not mushy) and taste wasn't any different from regular rice vermicelli.
4;and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....,;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages."
2;weird taste;I wouldn't recommend this particular flavor (the other flavors of Caveman Cookies are much better!)..
4;Delicious, with full flavor;"This is a great licorice!  Individual pieces are about 5"" in length - which is alot handier to eat than the traditional 12"" lengths.  The pomegranate flavor is unexpected and delicious!  This licorice has so much more flavor than other brands which to me taste like sugar gel."
5;As good as its going to get!;After travelling the 6000 miles it takes to get to its destination (my house), its a little on the flat side. But shake a bottle of soda around that long and thats what happens.
3;Uneven production quality;I have purchased a carton containing 12 boxes.<br /><br />At least half the boxes had a few crumbled thins in them and 2 of them had the taste of rancid butter.
5;Great tasting, balanced protein & fat, LOW phosphorous, great for cat with kidney problem;My cat just love them, chomping down the kibbles. He has started to gain weight & muscle back, and I am very happy with the results.
2;If you like grounds in your coffee;"then buy Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups.  Of the pack of 50 that came in the case, about 20 of them ""leaked"" grounds into the coffee."
2;Not like Claim Jumper;Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some.
5;very nice;The Earl Grey and Green tea mix is very smooth and a nice delicate flavor from the bergamot oil.<br />A nice way to start or end a day!  I enjoy this in the evening with my treat of Chocolove 70% cocoa<br />strong dark chocolate.
5;Buying online due to flood;When Tropical Storm Irene hit NH and VT, not only did many people lose their homes, but we lost several major shopping centers.  Many of the stores in those shopping centers suffered so much damage, they still have not reopened.
5;Delicious, wholesome product-- and the tins are great for knick knacks!;This is some of the most delicious oatmeal I have ever tasted. It is an all-natural product and the oatmeal is REAL.
5;Really different - Really good;What I like most about this product is its unique taste. Just enough spiciness and sweetness to make it different but it goes with virtually anything.
4;Great but!!!!;I purchased a box of apple bars recently thru Amazon.  Some were soft & some were very hard-the wrapper was not properly sealed.
5;GOOD DEAL;"I have twin two-year olds and a very heavy workload so these help me get through the day. They're a really good deal if you choose the ""subscribe and save"" option."
5;Delicious;This was the first time I'd had it, and love it.  Just wish I could find locally.
5;Great Product.;Great Product I personally do not like to drink large cans of energy drinks, so when I started taking these 5 hour energy shots It was exactly what I was looking for. Great Price and product.
1;Yucky;If this is supposed to be Indian food, then I don't like Indian cuisine.  The curry vegetable tasted like canned vegetable soup with curry in it.
5;Delicious!;A must for chocolate fountains.  Nothing to do but warm in microwave and pour into fountain.
4;San Francisco Bay, Decaf French Roast for Keurig K-cup brewers;This coffee compares very favorably with other French Roast decaf choices.  Since the K-cup itself is not sealed,<br />the packaging could be improved by making the plastic bag resealable.
2;Okay, but no Tulsi flavor;I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you.
1;False advertisement? Don't buy these.;I used to get these and kept wondering what other posters keep complaining about! Now I know. This time I bought 2 packs and I was in it for a surprise.
5;Great Northern Popcorn;This popcorn has a good taste like the movies theaters at a reasonable price. The package contains all of the ingredients and instructions to a good eating and popping experience.
5;great flavor, works for irregularity;if you're prone to irregularity, this remedy works everytime!drink a cup every night before sleep (it's decaf), and next morning, no more problems..
5;Great to have on hand;I have never been a fan of instant coffee, so the only reason I purchased this was to use in a homemade kahlua recipe.  The kahlua turned out great so I decided to get another jar to have on hand.
5;My cats really like this food;"I purchased the ""Indoor Adult 27"" formula by accident after using the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;"Does ""Made in USA"" = Ingredient USA Chicken or from China?";"I would like to hear from Smokehouse as to ""country of origin"" for the chicken they use in this product - since all the other products they sell (like regular chicken strips) are from China.  Is this basically the same Chinese-processed chicken imported and then combined with some vitamin E inside a US factory? Made in USA doesn't equate with product country of origin."
5;Red Bull sugar free, the nectar of the gods!!;Red Bull sugar free is the best.  No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.
1;Tea leaves too tiny... they end up in your tea cup.;I couldn't wait to have decaf english breakfast tea k-cups!  I was so disappointed when they arrived because the tea leaves must be too tiny as they end up coming out of the k-cup during brewing and you end up with almost the entire k-cup of tea leaves floating in your tea cup.  YUK.
5;Tested by a trucker;I love this product. I drink 1 gal of water a day, so this is a good switch in taste.
5;Quality Presels;Snyder's are the best quality pretzels, in my opinion.  The fact that they have been around for 100 years speaks for itself.
5;Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea;My favorite Twinings Tea variety - strong enough for a good wake-up in the morning, but has some wonderful aromatic qualities.  I've been drinking Twinings for years and years.
4;Great Italian tuna.;This can has a solid piece of tuna as compared with others. The Cento tuna is in pieces as compared with this.
5;Best tea ever;This is our all-time favorite tea especially for brewing a pot full and enjoying with family and friends either hot or iced.  I like the fact that it is a fairly strong tea and when we add ice (which we have done a lot of this summer), it doesn't dilute it too much.
1;Acidophilus needs improvement;It tastes great.  It has a sweeet tangy taste.
5;Excellent coffee;I am Italian and have grown up in Italy always drinking espresso from Moka machines. In our house we traditionally drank Lavazza, either Crema e Gusto or Oro ! I find crema e gusto less acid and a better value.
5;Coffee Masters Review;"I enjoy the Coffee Master Flavored Coffee,""Jamaican Me Crazy"".  It is very tasty and I will reorder when empty."
5;the best;This is my favorite kcup overall.  I have tried two hazelnut kinds but this one is the best.
3;Cheap and easy clean;Reviewing dog biscuits is a little difficult. Did my golden retriever eat the biscuits? Yes, quite readily.
5;This stuff is amazing!;Soooooo delicious. I want to drink one every day but it's so expensive that I have to limit myself to one every other day.
5;Love Them..;I love these crackers and wouldn't you know it they disappeared from all the stores in my area.  I finally found them at amazon now my friend and I share a case every so often.
2;Wolf Gang's Kcup Breakfast Blend a Sleeper;I ordered Wolf Gang Puck's k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee.
5;Sweet but good;These come in plastic containers and not glass which was a plus for me as they are easy to transport without the risk of breaking.  My daughter loved the taste, I guess because it is fairly sweet tasting.
4;Review for illy issimo cappuccino drink;I thought this drink tasted good both cold and heated up. I liked that it did not make me feel like I was getting cavities, unlike the starbucks bottled coffee, yet it was still sweet enough since I don't like drinking coffee black.
5;My Baby Loves Them!;My dog has been loving these for at least three years now, I like them because they are all natural. and good for her teeth.
5;Confusing Product Description but great customer service;This product desciption seems to me to indicate 12 boxes in a pack.  What you get is one box of 12 packets (one box) for about $18--not 12 boxes for that price.
5;Yummy!;I love this brand of k-cup! Just the right blend for me..
5;Good to the last nut;Old time favorite.  It has never changed.
5;Great mints;Love the mints.  Helps me with digestion and settles my stomach when needed.
5;Great fruitcake - but, a little pricey;I've eaten this fruitcake for several years now and it's a must for Christmas.  We love it frozen.
5;Great sustitute for icky 'cups of noodles';My kids love those cheap cups of noodles- I didn't like feeding them the MSG and other bad for you ingredients, so we tried these- taste even better- very good, will be buying again and will try some of the other flavors too!! I just wish they'd say where the 'natural flavor' comes from..
5;My wife is a big fan!;I'm not a big fan of flavored coffees but my wife most definitely is. The challenge is to find flavored coffees that actually taste like coffee, rather than some bizarre chemical flavoring, so that we can both enjoy it.
5;Great tasting sugar-free mints;The things I like best about these mints is their strong mint flavor and that they contain only a few ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Arabic, and Peppermint Essential Oil. I purchased them because I had read some articles that said Xylitol was good for oral health, that it helped to keep plaque from forming and from sticking to your teeth.
5;Ideal Low cal;This is really good.  I make creme brue.
5;My-Kaps work;K cups can be expensive and you often have your very own favorite coffee anyway.  Why not reuse those K cups!  This product is easy to use and will enable you to get an even better brew in your Keurig brewer when you use your own coffee.
1;pup love this, his teeth did not;a natural way to clean pups' teeth that isn't messy or smelly and that lasts a long time- my dog carries his around and will chew it for an hour at a time<br /><br />Editing review: my small dog, who had healthy teeth before I gave him antlers to chew, now has fractures on 4 molars from chewing. Give these chews with caution, if at all, tooth extraction is a painful & costly result of his enthusiasm for these chews.
5;Great product;I recently bought a Keurig Coffee maker because my husband and I love our coffee and tea, but sometimes want different drinks on certain days and this coffee maker fit the bill. We both enjoy this hot cocoa as much as do our grandchildren.
5;Must Try;This drink is great. I had the non-carbonated green tea which taste just like an Arizona Iced Tea only with a slightly creamier feel to it.
5;The best K-Cup flavor - Tully's Italian Roast;"Without question the best coffee available for a Keurig brewer! Consistently delicious! This box of 50 only lasts about one month in our home and this is not the only K-Cup flavor we purchase! <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Finally;I have been forced into a sugar free lifestyle for health reasons and have been trying to find a decent toffee / caramel SF candy for a while. I was skeptical with the malitol on the ingredients list.
5;WisSkye;These macaroons are great! They aren't too sweet and have a good flavor and consistency. We like the fact that they are made with quality ingredients, and tell ourselves that they are a healthy indulgence.
5;MADE IN THE USA! My dog loves these!;Pieces can be large so I break them up but there are also smaller pieces and some powder.You should keep it in the original package and take out a week's worth or so at a time and store in a jar or plastic container as it can get stale once out of the original package.
5;My favorite K Cups!!  Only 10 calories!;I was a bit scared to order these, because of the mixed reviews..
2;Got Fish?;These come packed in a bag of what I can only assume is fish juice. To put it simply, they reek of fish.
5;Great price!;Hemp seeds are an excellent source of Omega-3 (nice if you prefer not to eat fish/fish oil) and protein. I add a couple tablespoons to yogurt in the morning.
4;Unique, tasty, enjoyable;We bought these for a trip. They are very thin, which made packing easy.
5;Nice box - very flavorful tea;Nice addition to a gift with various other food items. This tea tastes excellent and the box is a good base for a gift buildup.
4;good product;We bought these for our adopted one-year-old yellow lab who is an obsessive chewer.  He goes through most rawhides faster than these.
1;Why would anyone pay this price?;$16.75?  Why would anyone pay this price?  It costs about $3-4 dollars in the grocery store.
5;Love Blue Buffalo;Blue Buffalo has a superior dog food.  I feel confident when using it that my dog is getting high quality food.
5;Quick, easy, tasty, can't beat it;Of course, they're not really kimchi.  But who cares?  If you like your reconstituted ramen on the spicy side, this hits the spot.
4;As advertised but very poorly packaged;Came as advertised but the interior package had broken open and the santas were roaming free in the box.  It is for my child's school project so I haven't tasted them.
5;So Good!!;I am so glad I purchased this maple sugar. The taste is unique and it's very sweet.
5;GREAT SUPPLEMENT;JOINT OATS 4 DOGS IS GREAT!  MY SASSY WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING UP AND DOWN AND MOVING AT ALL.  AFTER A FEW DAYS ON JOINT OATS 4 DOGS SHE WAS GETTING UP AND MOVING MUCH BETTER.
5;Just Great!;Just great, I am reordering right now..
1;mustard on my face;I was expecting the mustard to be in the nice plastic container as shown. Much to my surprise it came in to filmsy plastic bags.
4;Pricey, but better than competiton.;The flavour and strength changes, but, hey, it's made out of plants. Far too expensive.
3;Description is wrong - has Aspartame instead of Splenda;I dunno how Amazon gets this wrong - this cruddy tea comes with brain-drilling aspartame instead of Splenda. I am almost tempted to apply for a refund here.
4;Pleasant, mild, sweet;This is a nice, lightly-flavored, not too sweet coffee. The Caramel Vanilla Cream (also Green Mountain, also in a K-cup) is definitely rounder in flavor and stronger on the vanilla notes, but this is a pleasant, nice coffee.
5;Cats go veg;Two months ago my two cats ages 6 and 15 went from a flesh diet (tuna, chicken, salmon and salad with nutritional yeast) to a lacto-vegetarian diet with Evolution moist and dry food and they have never looked back. I do have to combine this moist food with Seven Stars plain yogurt and then they eat it all enthusiastically.
5;Great Dog Treat for Older Dogs;Our dog is older and has arthritis.  He has a hard time getting around sometimes.
5;good food;My dog gets tired of dry food so quickly we have to constantly switch from brand to brand, although there aren't many good food to choose from out there. We feed him EVO, blue buffalo wilderness, wellness core, and now we tried Instinct for 3 weeks by now, everything is just fine with him.
5;Great snack for toddler!;I love this for travel.  My 3 year old eats it in the car as a snack all the time.
5;These taste good but shop for price;My wife and I as well as other family members really like this brownie as a low calorie snack. No, it does not taste the same as the mouth watering chocolate brownies with hundreds of calories that my local bakery sells.
1;perhaps it was old or a bad batch, but not good at all...;I opened the first of four bags and it did *not* smell at all like chocolate or even like coffee.  It had a slightly odd odor, not good in fact, kind of like old leaves, but I thought that, just perhaps, a pot brewed from this might be okay.
5;love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!;I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones.
5;Good tinned crab.;I like this. It has good flavor & is in decent size pieces.
2;A little small....;I miss read before I ordered, got 2 very small tins of oil.  Later realized that there is a 2 LITER pack for nearly the same price.
5;Soooo good;I can't & won't order these anymore. I ordered two boxes, this and the one with dates.
5;The Best Salt EVER!!!;I love trying different salts and seasonings, but I have to say this may be my favorite salt ever! I use it in everything. You won't believe how much flavor difference just a little amount makes, and it smells divine.
5;good stuff;My beagle puppy and  his vet love it -- he is thriving on it. I add some wet food to it twice a day but he eats just dry kibbles without a fuzz.
1;very disappointed;i was expecting the lollipops to be as represented in the picture - cute packaging and quantity of 2.  instead i got a single broken lollipop in a plastic bag.
4;like edible Lincoln Logs;My dogs are pretty enthusiastic about these chew sticks [however, they are not very discerning.  They eat anything.
5;The perfect cup of tea;I first had this company's tea in Seattle.  It is a little shop at the famous open air market, Pike's Place.
5;Solved my sensitive cat tummy problem;"I've tried a lot of ""natural"" cat food but still had one or more cats tossing their food fairly regularly (we have 5 cats).  I saw this in Whole Foods on special and gave it a try."
4;Zukes Mini Naturals  Dog Treats;These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks
3;Product arrived spilled.;When I got my package, my bottle was apparently squeezed during shipment and had spilled a bit :\<br /><br />What I did notice was that if you turn the product upside down with the cap off, it DOESN'T SPILL. Liquid comes out ONLY when its SQUEEZED which is why mines spilled in the upright position during shipment.
1;not impressed;The shampoo made my hair quite dull, and it was greasy just a few hours after washing, and made my scalp itch. I didn't notice any root boost or hair having any more volume, it looks quite fuzzy after the shampoo.
4;"Not exactly real ""matcha"" but still good";This isn't real matcha, but that shouldn't discourage you from trying it out.  For one thing, it makes a great flavoring ingredient in food and allows you to make your own matcha late at home.
2;This is a TERRIBLE PRICE;Don't pay $12 for 8 pouches. You can get the same amount for four bucks at your local Target (or similar).
1;This is the Wrong Product;This product IS mislabeled, this is #6 of the collection, not #5.  do your research before purchase!  A LIQUOR STORE THAT DOESN'T KNOW IT'S OWN PRODUCTS MAY RIP YOU OFF, by mistake or on purpose.
4;Good Columbian;Dark and full flavored, but distinctly Columbian.  This is a great morning coffee.
5;Tips: My baby started this from 2 weeks and is now a happy, healthy 9 mo old.;I had previously had three babies that breastfed like pros, but my fourth child had to have formula because she did not suck strong enough to make my milk supply stay at all and for some reason pumps don't work for me--even the hospital ones : (<br /><br />At two weeks I started transitioning my baby from Enfamil newborn to Baby's Only.  I did half and half for 2 canisters worth.
3;Sliced Hard Chicken Hot Dogs for Cats!;"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
5;Yum (or so it seems);I don't know what it is about them, but dogs will listen to you if you're offering one of these as a reward. My dog gets one every night, after she performs a few tricks flawlessly knowling the reward is one of these.
2;Not as good as others;I ordered these naively thinking they would taste the same as any other crystallized ginger.  I mean, they only have two ingredients, right?  Wrong, these were weirdly like gummy bears instead of chewy and they had very inconsistent flavor.
1;Preservatives;Their products, at least the mulberry jam, do contain preservatives despite the info on their website leads you to believe. If you ask them directly they'll tell you.
1;Not a fan of the Sweet Potato Pop Chips;Our family has liked every other flavored we have tried (BBQ is the best). We like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips.
4;great sauce - terrible bottle;First let me say this is a wonderful hot sauce.  Spicy, flavorful, a wonderful addition to soups, pizza, etc.
5;Dogs love it!;When I take my dogs for a walk or haven them go to their doggie room, they love this treats not to fatty in content yet it's soft and chewable for their teeth.<br />Def get your kids (furkids) this treats they love you even MORE.
5;Very tasty and calming;I love having a cup of Jasmine Blossom Gream tea at night. It is very tasty and calming.
3;weak;I was very disappointed. Too expensive.
5;best sleep ever;"I usually need a xanex and 5mg of melatonin (ingredient in this drink) to fall asleep, and to stay asleep. Having an anxiety disorder I am always ""revved."
5;Healthy snack food for the kiddos;My three year old daughter and her friends love Veggie Booty.  While it's not my personal favorite (the powdered spinach, kale, and carrot are a little weird for my palate, though my husband likes it pretty well), a bowl of it brings toddlers running like pigs to the trough.
2;Nasty;I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.
4;caribou blend coffee;What can I say, the deer and the antelop did not do anything to this coffee.  Neither did the caribou.
4;Best Coffee From Starbucks Yet, But, It Comes at a Price..;Brewed on the 10 oz. setting on my Keurig Platinum brewer, the first thing I noticed was the very nice, enticing aroma.
5;Sweet Jasmine;I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.
3;Nice plant but no tray;The bonsai is a nice plant, and it did arrive in good condition and with instructions on how to care for it. My only complaint is the lack of a tray, and since the pot has holes in it you will need one.
3;Pretty Good;This coffee is a lot like the Green Mountain Nantucket blend.  If you like that, you'll like this.
5;Excellent product for low carb dieters;A few drops go a long way with this product, this has been an excellent item for sweetening desserts, tea and drinks without the additives of powder Splenda.  This product has no after taste and is great if you are low carb dieting.
5;Good quality noodles.;Excellent with fishball or shrimpball. Good quality and safer than chinese made noodles ( Japanese have strict quality standard on their products ).
1;I will not buy from any company supporting Rush!;Since flowers are mostly bought either for or by women, it seems self destructive to support someone who denigrates your entire customer base.  Not all of us have bought into the conservative war on women's health led by Rush and his Republican cronies.
5;Great Spaghetti Sauce;We used to have to order this from California, but no more. If you haven't tried it, then you need to it's great.
1;Worst Product ever Amazon should not allow this seller to rip people off;"WORTHLESS - NO GOOD ""Enerjets Wake Up Energy Booster Drops, Mocha Mint Flavor - 12 Caffeinated Drops/Pack, 12 Packs""<br /><br />This is $2 (two) dollar candy sold for $30 buck + shippping.  This is this the biggest RIP-OFF product I have ever experienced in Amazon."
3;Amazon service is 6 stars.;These bulbs make my room (painted blue) look absolutely vivid and beautiful, specially compared to my previous 27K CFL lightbulbs.<br /><br />I have ALZO 55K lightbulbs, love it so decided to change all my 27K CFL lightbulbs to 55K in my first floor.
5;A little bit of Paradise;"The company gets a 5 star for rapid fast shipping and great customer service! The product gets a 5 star for the flavor. I can get addicted to this brand of Soan Papdi! If you are ""new"" to Indian Sweets and like the inside of a Butterfinger Candy bar, than you will love this."
5;best home made coffee;Senseo coffee is rich and satisfying--it has that froth on top.<br />I recommend using these podds because they are biodegradable.
5;Best Purchase in Months;I've always loved this cereal.  However the price was so much better here at Amazon, and the package arrived faster than I expected.
5;Delicious and Healthy Too;Ginger is one of my least favorite spices
5;My Favorite Flavor;I love these. The Hazlenut are my most favorite flavors.
5;Tasty, easy to make, low in calories;This is a very tasty drink.  Definitely tastes like a mojito, nice mint flavor with a touch of lime.
4;Great popcorn!;You won't go wrong with this popcorn. It taste great and you have everything you need.
5;I Love anything Honey Stinger;I purchased these mostly for my long rides, but found they make a perfect afternoon snack as well. They are delicious, and perfect for my afternoon pick me up at work and to get some calories in me while i'm riding, if I don't feel like eating a Gu or some other mush.
5;best, lightest breading;Panko makes the crispiest, lightest breading. It is great for meats, seafood, veggies, and even some sweets (I have had some of the best fried ice cream that was covered in Panko crumbs, but you can also do bananas).
4;Floral & Berry Coffee?;"After trying the Marley Coffee, I was pleased with its rich flavors of floral and berry.  This coffee does tend to have a slight  bitter aftertaste, so might be better for individuals who prefer ""stronger blends""."
4;coke bottle gummys;very fresh soft and moist with great cola taste. I think I said every thing I need to in 9 words.
5;Most Delicious Canned Tuna Ever, but...;it will ruin all other canned tuna for you.  So be forewarned, once you become accustomed to THIS canned tuna, you will not be satisfied by any others.
1;This rating is for the shipping cost, not the product itself;As the title says, please consider that this is more of a comment on the shipping cost, not the product itself.  For the record, I'd rate the product at 5 star, I don't know if it's just the use of sugar over corn syrup, or if the formula is a bit different, but these I feel taste much better then corn syruped based coca cola classing in the USA.
5;Excellent, natural chip;You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.
4;Great taste-low sodium!;I'm on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium.
4;Good Quality Raw Walnuts;I thought these were good quality raw walnuts.  The pieces of walnut were bigger and in better shape than the ones I buy in bulk at the health food store.
3;Need to add more tablespoons to get the flavor.;I have to echo the sentiments of others on here, the recommended amount is not nearly enough.  You have to add 3-4 tablespoons to really get any flavor.
4;Good, but very spicy;I love carrot cake and if I have the time, I would make it from scratch. But, I'm busy and usually don't have time to grate carrots and sift flour.
5;A little lacking;I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.
5;Yummy;I love macaroons and I figured that was one thing I wasn't never able to eat again after being diagnosed with Celiac disease. These are a God-send.
4;Good in moderation.;Sometimes you want a snack with a little substance (albeit mechanically seperated chicken and MSG), and Slim Jim's satisfy that craving. I polished off the box in about a month and I don't regret the purchase one bit.
3;Decent but not life changing;I like my tea strong so I was hoping the the pyramid bag would allow for more/stronger favor.  Didn't seen to be any stronger than my favorite Tazo Teas.
5;Your Pet will Love them;Absolutely delicious. I crumble a chicken treat and top my raw food that I make for my kitty.
5;Love these!;I purchased these on QVC and followed their on-air instructions.  The noodles turned out perfect, were not rubbery, and absorbed the sauce nicely.
5;The opposite of sleepy time !;I tried the 2 pack..
5;You really can serve it for company;The box says, you don't have to admit that it comes from a box because it is so tasty. I had guests over and they raved about it.
5;Linda's kitchen in Wilkes County, NC;These noodles are the best if you are making chicken noodle soup.  They have a flavor that other noodles don't have.
3;The Real Thing  OK.  reduced from 4 to 3 stars.;Good taste, medium roast, slightly oily beans.  Hints of velvety aftertaste long after drinking.
5;How to make a quick inexpensive paella at home;I added the photo on this page. I'm from Miami originally and miss the paella we used to get cheap there, in the 70's.
5;Heaven Sent;I have never liked cereal while I was still living in the Philippines. When my husband introduced Raisin Bran Crunch here in the US.
2;Too Sweet, doesn't taste like Chai;I tried mixing half with milk and it just tastes like sweet milk, no Chai flavor at all. I ended up using it almost full strength with cream instead to get more flavor.
5;Dogs love these.;My 2 poodles just love this product. And they are good for them.
5;For Movie Popcorn Addicts;Taste just like the movies. Just add your own butter.
4;awesome food and smells like fish!;Unlike most pet owners in the world, I have fed my dogs high quality foods for years, with Acana pacifica being one of them. I don't buy it from amazon but get it by subscription from a petfood site for 54 bucks shipped for the large size.
5;If it doesnt make your eyes sweat, its not hot enuf!;That is my husbands' view
5;Great taste.;This is very good coffee. I don't like strong coffee, this is nice and mild, a great breakfast blend.
5;The Only Mayo That Agrees With Me;I originally bought this at Cub Foods and was pleasantly surprised it did not make me feel sick at all. All other mayo's- even watered down make me nauseated or give me a stomach ache.
5;great product @ great price;I love this organic ghee, the taste is incredible, very healthy for your diet intake and heart health, and excellent for overall cooking and baking needs. Also impressed by the amazon price.
4;McCann's Steel Cut Oats - Still Great...this 72 ounce packaging - Not good;I still really, really enjoy the McCann's steel-cut oats so much (see earlier review) that I decided to order the six, large 72-ounce containers this time.  The packaging is not adequate for the weight of the oats.
5;Good product for people who must reduce salt;"I'm trying to cut down on my salt because of blood pressure. This stuff isn't the most ""natural"" chicken bouillon, but it does taste like chicken, at least to me."
5;Great gift for your favorite small dog!;I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.
2;Lindsor White Chocolate;I ordered Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars and recieved Lindsor White Chocolate Truffles. I do not like white chocolate.
5;Super-Dooper;A quick recommendation, get the .5 ounce bottle, or smaller.
5;Another Chapter in the Saga of Mary-Kate the Feral Geyser;NOTE:  My vet is monitoring my cat's situation really closely, and the minute the vet says bring her in, that's exactly what will happen.  If your cat is having similar issues and doesn't get really unduly stressed by human contact to the point that it's counterproductive to rush her to the vet unless her situation is life threatening, PLEASE take your cat to the vet at once.
3;Just a Squeeze is All it Takes;Vitamin Squeeze is a good means to improve nutrition and liven up the taste of plain, boring H2O. Just a small squeeze is all it takes to add vitamins and flavor to a glass of water, encouraging better nutrition and more frequent water consumption- two things we could all use more of in our diet.
4;Good but make sure you purchase the correct size;These chews work relatively well but I'd recommend a few things:<br /><br />Make sure that you are purchasing the appropriate size chew for your dog. Rather than going by the weight listed on the package, it makes more sense to consider the size of your dog's head.
5;Yum, Yum, Yum - the best!;I was happy to find that this Mam Papauls red velvet cake mix (29 oz) had the cake AND the frosting in one box!  This is a fabulous cake mix - tastes great, looks great, and makes a big 2 layer cake or tons of cupcakes.  Everyone loves them.
5;Sweet only begins to describe it...more chocolate than you can imagine.;It is sooo chocolatey and rich that you can't eat more than a tiny piece.<br /><br />Slice it all out of the box in about half inch pieces and put it back in or serve it out of box, because if you try to slice it in the box and get a piece out in one piece it's impossible.
3;expensive!;Well, I walked in from Walmart five minutes ago, after buying a bottle of this for $1.68.
5;Great price, exactly what we wanted!;We received this exactly as sold.  The price was better than great, it was fantastic.
5;Very Good;The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.
5;Lose the mint, keep the hibiscus;This is, by far, my favorite tea, and the only one I always drink without any flavorings.  When I found its ingredients promote lower blood pressure, I decided to restore it to my daily regimen.
5;My mouth is watering while writing this review;I just tried these for the first time last night..
5;The best store bought sauce;I love to barbecue and I was a big bulls eye fan and loved their sauces.  One day I bought the kansas city sauce from Cattleman's and I was really blown away.
5;I love this coffee;This is the best coffee ever and I can't imagine drinking any of the usual swill ever again..
5;Treat Yourself;If you want to treat yourself, these are the bars.  They are so good in my opinion and I savor them when I treat myself.
5;For the oatmeal conoisseur;If you are used to microwaving your Quaker oatmeal and pouring a packet of powder that is mildly like apples and cinnamon into the bowl, then this might not be the oatmeal for you. It has things like texture and a flavor of its own going for it.
5;Doggy Approved;My pup absolutely loved this as soon as he saw it. Though the treats we had gotten were a bit big for the size we had gotten, but was fun for our pup even without anything in it.
5;Great Purchase;I have had a difficult time finding this product locally. Amazon has this product at a good price.
4;Delicious Breakfast cereal with holding power;This a a great breakfest cereal that keeps one full for hours unlike many I have eaten.  It is full of nuts and fruit and tastes great.
5;Good stuff!;It took me a few times to figure out the consistency I like but after that it was all golden. I will keep buying this product.
5;Our daughter LOVES these cookie bars!;Our daughter has several food allergies, so Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars are perfect!  Out of all the Gluten-free cookies out there, my daughter just LOVES Nana's.  NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.
5;Hooray for the Treat Ball!;"My sister's youngest son had a pacifier which was nicknamed ""Pluggy"", which would keep him content for long stretches of time - and this is the doggy equivalent.<br /><br />I have a 17 pound Bedlington Terrier, for whom I purchased a Medium sized Everlasting Treat Ball, and we _both_ love it."
3;Just OK;"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again."
5;Great cat food;"Was thrilled to find this food on Amazon after local ""big box"" pet store stopped carrying it. Kitty loves it and doesn't seem to get bored with it"
4;Jules Destrooper Buyyer Waffles;This a great light snack.Two of these delicious belgian waffles has 130 calories with only 50 from fat.
4;superfood;I bought the paste because I think it is easier to eat. I add it to salad dressings and it is fantastic.
5;A Hit for Mealtime;I had just learned about quinoa from my daughter and thought that I'd try it.  What a hit!  My husband enjoys it and everyone comments on it when I serve it.
5;Loosen up and Enjoy Life!;I wonder if the average person knows how difficult it is for someone with severe food allergies to find packaged preprepared foods they can safely eat?  Let alone something that actually resembles the real thing in taste and texture (without tasting like flavored cardboard).<br /><br />I'm allergic to soy, gluten, wheat and various other foods.
5;Rockstars...ummm...rock?;Actually, I work third shift and its these bad boys that keep me going most of the time. They're pretty addictive though if you like the taste, which is certainly not for everyone.
5;Found this through a local pet store;I was getting Authority Lamb through Petsmart online because I moved and there isn't one near me.  It wasn't cheap with the shipping and not so cheap even without, but my 20 pound shelter dog was doing well on it, so.
5;Great Substitute!;We can no longer drink coffee and husband can't drink cocoa.  Gave this flavor and the Chai flavor a try.
1;BOYCOTT ALL!!!! GMO helper sneaky poisoners!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;The best for baking/cooking;This product has made my life so much sweeter.  Being sugar sensitivie there was a time where I didn't get sweets other then friut, then I discovered Lakanto and all that changed.
3;Tastes good;"This cereal I tried the other day and it was good.<br /><br />I think the Blueberries in it don't contribute to your health since I read:<br /><br />""According to a study in the March 15, 2009 journal Free Radical Biology & Medicine, ingesting blueberries with milk impairs the antioxidant properties of the blueberries."
5;Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!;I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.
5;Oatmeal for adults;"If you have only eaten ""rolled oats"" try an adult cereal and see what you've been missing.  It takes much more time to cook than the instant oatmeal ""paste"" but it is so much better it is worth every additional minute."
5;Completely addicted;I LOVE Cinnamon Altoids.  I go through at least 1 tin a day, and so buying online - at a better price than local retail - is a must.
5;best cake ever;I was thrilled to learn that I could get DH caramel cake on amazon.com.
5;Bev;I was recently told that I need to consume products that have less caffeine
4;Great Value;While I think the quality is a slight notch below Illy, Lavazza espresso is excellent and is less than half the price of Illy.  It is much better than Starbuck's espresso.
2;Good product, but bad from Amazon;"I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the ""Farmers Market"" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did."
5;Good Coffee For the Price;No complaints from the guys at work.  On packet for 8oz, two for 12oz.
1;Didn't work for me, but maybe I didn't have enough fleas;My dog was having a serious flea problem and I figured it was the whole house since I could see the fleas jumping off my bed.  Our house is very clean and I vacuum once a week so I was surprised to see so many fleas.
4;Not as hot as you'd think;Blue Diamond almonds are a huge favorite and I like trying all the flavors that they have.  These Habanero BBQ almonds are not spicy and actually have a sweet taste to it due to the bbq flavoring.
5;no longer marketed in US?;This is the ONLY Guarana soft drink..
5;WALNUTS;WITH MY BREAKFAST CEREAL IN THE MORNING I ADD FRUIT AND NUTS TO MAKE UP A GOOD HEALTHY COMBINATION. THESE WALNUTS ARE DELICIOUS ON THEIR OWN AS A SNACK WHILE WATCHING TV.
5;Great for Pasta Salad;"I use this as my ""secret ingredient"" for pasta salad which is always a hit! I also use it in chicken, tuna and egg salad and have used it in deviled eggs too. I started using it also via Costco and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it."
5;GREAT Alternative to Raw;I have 5 toy dogs.  My almost 2 year old Japanese Chin, Yoshi, has a severe underbite and has difficulty eating dry dog food.
5;My husband's favorite;These are my husband's favorite suckers.  It is a shame that they can only be found in the stores around halloween.
5;I love these;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Love these Chips!;Beanitos Chipotle BBQ chips are very satiating and perfectly seasoned.  They are amazing!  I love, love, love that they are made with NON-GMO ingredients, plus contain no corn, no wheat, high fiber, and high protein.
4;Wonderful sampling of dishes;This is a wonderful array of some classic Indian dishes. They are very nicely spiced, very flavorful, and good alternative to expensive take-out.
4;not what I expected;I love popcorn especially theater flavor, purchase 2 boxes, one tasted exactly as a theater flavor the other ox do not know if it was old popcorn or ?? did not taste as theater popcorn, no salt flavor :( happy with one box, unhappy with 2nd box. Unable to tell if I would purchase this product again.
5;Thank you for Bobs Red Mill Flazseed Meal;We are enjoying the flaxseed meal.  We put some in our juice or in our cereal for breakfast every day.
3;Inherently Good - Not Great...;These are a very crunchy cookie with a creamy center.  The cookie part crumbles into many bits.
2;not a strong enough flavor;I didn't think the flavor was strong or distinctive enough. A pretty inoffensive tea, but after being spoiled by Tazo's Teas, it's hard to look at a tea like this the same way.
5;If You Love Your Cat;The results we have had since we switched to Newman's Own Pet food are phenomenal. All of our pets look and act younger, their coats are shiny, their noses are wet, and they have a bounce to their step.
2;Robitussin Sodas, anyone?;Let me start out by saying how sad I am to give this product a negative review.  I love watermelon EVERYTHING, so I was super excited when I saw this new syrup was available.
4;Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?;I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers.
5;Mrs. Grass Vegetable soup;Love this stuff.  Been using it for many years.
1;False advertising?;I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written.
1;Only One?;"I thought I was buying a bag full of these for $9 but there was only one 4"" antler piece in the bag!  If my dog's last name was Gucci, Rockefeller, or Gates, this might make sense. But I am just an average guy so the price (including shipping) was rediculous for what I got."
4;Great snack size packs;Most of us have liked Graham crackers since we were kids. When you buy a regular box however, unless you finish them quickly, they can go stale.
5;Fresh and tasty;This product arrive in good time and condition. Very fresh and easy to cook.
5;Very Good, Lots of Clams and Natural Recipe;Good flavor and not too rich--fewer fat calories than the standard fare. It's not loaded up with canola oil like Campbell's and Progresso, so you can add a little quality EVOO like California Olive Ranch, or even butter for a healthier brew if you prefer it that way like we do.
5;Easily the best preserves I have ever had.  In a class by itself.;I found Tiptree's Little Scarlet Strawberry Preserves at a fancy hotel at least 20 years ago.  I have kept at least 5 jars of it in my home at all times since then.
5;Great for cooking;I don't drink soy milk on its own, but I do like the health benefits of it. I use it to make steel cut oats in the crock pot over night.
4;Very good for less than $5.00;Just received mine and am very satisfied considering it was less than 5 dollars. Only 3 had expired in December, one expired in January, and a few will expire in March.
5;Hot stuff for the Islanders!  Yo!;"Well, I got this item as a gift to an Islander that is a special treat for the family. It is hard to find in regular stores (lots of other spam but not much<br />""Hot and Spicy"" anywhere in the US of A."
5;ice cream is my downfall;i have been wanting to try this ever since it became available. I ordered the pumpkin and loved it.
5;Use it everyday;I use this for most of my cooking. It's great for baking and using in pancakes.
5;Good for you and great tasting!;For a yummy treat on Saturday mornings, these wonderful pancakes give you less to feel guilty about, eating pancakes with great nutritional value.  I really enjoy them and think they taste better than regular pancakes.
1;5-Hour Energy Review;It may help you in the short run but it does damage to your heart in the long run. It also taste awful this side of Cherry 7Up.
5;my two dogs are now genuises;I just opened a bag of these mini naturals in chicken flavor, and did some training with my two shelties.  Within a few samples of the treat, my dogs were doing whatever I asked, quickly, and for quite a long time.
5;My dog loves it;I was buying the Pedigree Little Champions pouches because Amazon had the best pricing as usual.All of a sudden my little girl turned up her nose at this food and i was VERY CONCERNED because she is 13 years old now.
5;Really good coffee;Nice to be able to get this like this anywhere. Very good coffee at a very good price.
3;Suchard's Hot Chocolate, too sweet?;"I have to agree with most other people in saying that this ""hot chocolate"" is far too sweet. However, if you add an expresso disc to your drink it's pretty good."
5;My baby's favorite flavors!;"My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes, ""Mmm, mmm,"" lol."
5;Kcups Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold;If you like a bold coffee that's strong but not bitter, this is the coffee for you.  It has a great full-bodied flavor that's very enjoyable to taste.
5;Happy Senseo Customer;A year ago we brought the Senseo machine back from Holland and have been using it with a $100 transformer here in the States, but it was worth it all. Now we're overjoyed that the machines have finally come to the USA, we already purchased three and have recommended it to friends who also have bought the machine.
3;Tasty with Poor Packaging;The mandarin oranges are tasty ..
5;YUM!;My dogs love the Lickety Stik! I got the bacon flavor, is there anything better than bacon? I use it to distract Joe when his nails are trimmed, he hates having his nails trimmed. Once I figured out that I need to squeeze it gently because the ball doesn't turn it worked fine.
3;ok;I was expected real Jamaican taste coffee, but the bean doesn't have the deep taste as I needed. But I know it's hard to find Jamaican coffee in US.
5;Terrific for your dog!;After the cat food scare, our family decided to take a very close look at what we were feeding our three cats and two German Shepherd Dogs, and for a while we made all the food for all the pets. Finally we found Solid Gold Barking at the Moon dry dog food, and we now mix the appropriate amount with rice and vegetables so the dogs get enough bulk to be full, but not more calories than they need.
5;Wonderful comforting tea;At the moment I am drinking a cup to comfort me during the flu.<br /> It is a wonderful deep rich comforting tea.
4;Good Product;This is a very good value.  I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth.
4;Om nom nom nom;"I'm not sure what else to say. I was expecting ""Top Ramen"" and got a wonderful bowl of noodles."
1;Yuck;I am NOT a fan. I tried these as I have heard several times that boiled peanuts are a good snack.
4;I loved them so much but then got sSOOO sick of them;hmmmmm soo it started out with OMG I cant live without these-- there was a month I was extremely busy with school so I went through 4 of these  a day..
5;Pleasant surprise;I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this tea. Great lemon flavor that is not in any way overpowering.
5;Dan's Perfect Popcorn;Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.
5;Surprisingly Yummy Cookies;To be fair, I should say that I haven't ordered these cookies from Amazon.com yet, so I can't speak for the condition they arrive in.
5;Catit Fountain;I personally love this fountain and I have owned three different kinds.  This one is very quiet unless water level is low.
4;Good Food;Science Diet has always been known for decent quality food to feed your cat or dog.  This product is no different.
5;Great take anywhere snack;These are so good, and worth the money.  Everyone in your family will love this.
3;Gobstoppers from this Vendor;I absolutely love Gobstoppers, never finding any problems with the quality from the manufacturer.  However, this vendor delivered 2 huge cases of Gobstoppers to me that obviously had been damaged by dampness or water.
5;Excellant choice of seasoning;This is a excellant seasoning for many different meats, soups, ect. when BBQing.
5;Delicious!;"At first I was thinking, ""cheese flavored chips?""  But I love them.  The herbs they used are just delicious."
5;Otis will eat it!;Otis is what I call a very picky eater. The fact is, until now, he would not eat the same cat food twice! He is 10 years old.
5;New Kitten Loves It;Healthy food and kitten gobbles it down.  I personally like the approach Science Diet takes to balanced nutritional, even if the food is not all organic or natural.
5;Awesome Low Calorie Dessert!;Wonderful taste and texture.  One of the best low calorie desserts to be found.
5;the real review;My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns.
5;Milo Jars;My husband and I have been trying to find this Milo and we were happy when we found these great jars.  The item arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
5;Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!;This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding.
1;Ever eat wood bark before?;This product does not have an overpowering smell of salmon and taste-wise it was ok. It sort of taste like a piece of onion with salt and a bit of pepper.
4;Pastry flour with no pastry in its name.;I thought I was ordering pastry flour, which is used for pie making and biscuits. Consistancy is a little different from what I have had before.
5;"""Liquid death""?";I was treated to this a year ago by one of my college roomies. It quickly became a symbol of manliness in our suite.
5;Just got my flowers;Just got my Roses and they are perfect.  Did no know a vase would be included also.
5;super yummy, and healthier than most crackers;My favorite cracker.  Think of it as an upscale wheat thin.
4;Not Bad;This rum is slow to hit you. Usually rum impacts me pretty fast, but this stuff waits to smack you.
5;Best multi-vitamin!!!;I've been searching for a multi-vitamin that my children woudn't cringe at the sight of being offered.  I've finally found it in Nordic Naturals Nordic Berries!  We have tried other various vitamins--the hard chewable kinds as well as other gummies--and none of them fit the bill for both natural goodness and tastiness as Nordic Berries do.
4;Finally figured it out;I tried these in my Senseo machine due to the unavailability of their brand of coffee pods.  Several attempts and finally got a decent cup of coffee.
5;Good bully sticks;Very happy with the product. They do have a distinct smell, but I just put them in a container for storage.
5;Chai on a Cold Winter's Night...  Perfect!;I have been a Stash Tea fan for years.  The price on Amazon Grocery is terrific, and yes, you will drink your chai every day throughout the winter!  Try the regular or decaf chai with a tablespoon or two of real cream--it's the perfect drink for those chilly days.
5;The Best;I love this hot chocolate.  It's very rich, and not as sweet as other brands.
5;Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!;Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense.
5;protein and espresso;"hits the spot,not humdrum,great hot or cold tastes like a treat and an added kick of energy for me,i got it for the protein after gastric bypass but i seem to have been making extra being that my hubby likes it too,awsome product!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Delicious!  You Will Think You Are Being Bad...;All I can say is that they are deliciously seasoned, nicely textured and habit forming.  My son brought some home one night from his new job.
5;Perfect Capsule Storage;We have two of these and just love them.  They spin very easily, making it easy to select the coffee capsule you need.
5;Great Rice;I have been to Thailand and this is the same rice that is available there. This is a great all purpose rice with a wonderful taste and cooks up easy and has a fantastic fragrance.
1;awful;this does not even begin to resemble licorice as we know it. Nasty wee tiny hard stuff that has been flavored with licorice.
5;Best maple syrup on the market.;This is really outstanding, and far better than I expected it to be.  I had read a comment in Cooks Illustrated that Grade B maple syrup has a much stronger, more pronounced flavor.
5;Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.;After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.
5;Powdered cream!;I had no idea such a thing exists! I know there are synthetic chemically-based powder creamers but I have no interest in them. I try to stay on a low-carb diet (which I think rules out powder creamers anyway) & I like to use heavy cream for my morning coffee.
3;I love cinnamon!;This product was my first introduction to freshly ground cinnamon.  I prefer the taste of Drogheria & Alimentari freshly ground cinnamon on frozen yogurt or oatmeal.
2;Redbarn Filled Bone, Cheese N'Bacon - Small;Bones are very expensive for size. I can buy twice the size for same price (and same brand)at retail stores.
5;Great espresso, great customer service!;This espresso blend is really nice. I use it in my Breville Express espresso machine.
5;Sophie loves these!;Great chews and no rawhide worries. Great for sharp puppy teeth.
5;Better than store brands;Hi to be honest with you i've bought 5-6 honeys with amazon all taste great.i like the raw honey the best.
5;Quality Dog Food at a great price.;What more could you possibly want? Quality dog food in bulk quantity at a great price. Free two day shipping for prime members.
5;Ackkkk!  No longer available??;Since these bars are always sold out at my local store, I've been buying them in bulk at Amazon.  But now they are NOT AVAILABLE??  The only thing Amazon is selling it variety packs which include 3 kinds: these, almond chocolate bars (good) and the caramel bars, which I don't like.
5;enjoy with any fried food;Maggi sauces are pretty common, but the only one I found myself craving was the Maggi Masala Chili. It is the only Maggi sauce with some bite (it's spicy), and it's perfect with almost any fried dish.
5;Andes Crunch Peppermint Crunch Baking Chips;WONDERFUL PINK PEPPERMINT FUDGE<br /><br />4 1/2 cups sugar<br />1 stick of butter<br />1 can evaporated milk<br />Mix the above ingredients and cook EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes<br />Remove from heat and VERY QUICKLY add<br />2 pkgs Peppermint Crunch Chips<br />1 70z jar marshmallow creme<br />1 teas.vanilla<br />Stir until smooth and pour into a greased pan.
5;Best Popcorn;This is the best popcorn I have ever had.  As a kid I ran the popcorn machine in a theater so I feel I know what I'm talking about.
5;Excellent product, excellent service;I looked online for this product because i couldn't find it in any store in my area and i wanted to try a new recipe where wakame was key.  The product is excellent, the service was impeccable and got the best price for product and shipping.
4;Handy, Small, Easy to Use;This is a great idea.  A liquid water enhancer that comes in a small container.
5;Delicious, what else did you expect?;Seriously, now. Tasty, tasty, tasty.
5;Super Sweet Deal;This is much better than man-made syrups. It is sweeter and has a deeper flavor than the high fructose or corn syrup varieties.
5;Great Nuts;I think you should know what you are getting is a box..
5;Does Exactly What It Claims;I switched to an Ayurvedic hair care regimen nearly a year ago. This product along with other herbs (like Brahmi, Amla, Neem & Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder) when mixed with Bhringraj or Neem oil acts as an effective treatment against brittle hair, hair loss, and dryness.
5;Wine Crackers;We loved the flavor and light texture of these crackers.  We crunch them up on salads & use them as snacks.
4;Fantastic value;My dogs enjoy this food and seem lively and excited to eat it. Very happy also that it's not made by Menu Foods - peace of mind factor is high.
5;Tasty;adds a whole new dimension to any dish. its not your typical hot sauce that just hot.
5;Crunchy and yummy (as far as I can tell);My dog isn't much of a food critic (considering his tastes in sidewalk bubblegum), but he sure does like a nice biscuit. These are pretty standard, crunchy ones that he seems to enjoy.
5;Good Deals at Amazon.com;When buying on line my first stop is at Amazon.com.
5;ADDICTING!;These chips are the BEST out there. Period.
5;addictive;Am addicted to Snickers w/Almonds and no other bar will do.  Very hard to find in my area so buy them by the handful when I can.
5;mandarin orange spice herb tea;This is the best spiced tea I have ever had.<br />The flavors are strong and do not weaken after brewing.
5;Messy but enjoyable treat;"The only thing our 2 hounds like better are the bigger bones cured the same way.  They are messy and I suggest they become and ""Out door treat"" at least until all the meat is gone."
5;Delicious;I love this time of year. Pumpkin spice is my fav.
5;Best Seasoning Around;In addition to herbs and spices, this is the only seasoning that I use in my cooking.  I was having difficulty in finding this product in local supermarkets here so I was elated to see that Amazom had it.
1;Worst coffee ever;I am not a coffee snob, and not very up on the various types of coffee's out there, but I certainly know when something tastes like burnt crap! I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it.
5;very good coffee, great price.........;This is a very good KONA blend coffee and compares to others that cost twice as much or more!<br />I was using Kona blend from a small company - Thanksgiving coffee Co, Fort Bragg, CA., but their price (about $18/lb.
3;Price was good, needs a date and where it's from;"""Organic"" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic."
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
4;Tully's is One of the Best for K-Cups;Tully's is without a doubt one of my favorite K-Cups. I'd say my top two are Tully's House Blend and Newman's Own.
3;Tasty;Adds a lot of flavor. Really good value if you have a spice mill or a Vita-mix to grind the seeds into a powder.
5;This blows Kraft mac and cheese away!;My family loves this mac and cheese.  I orginally bought it because it's 'totally natural' but we love it for the taste.
5;Delicious!;This stuff  smells like oatmeal cookies. It's thick and a little chunky - my daughter loves it!  (i have also tasted it and it is quite good.
4;ginseng coffee;I like the taste of this coffee package plus the convience of using it.  I would recommend it to anybody who travels a lot and want cream and sugar in their coffee, much better than hotel coffee.
4;It Is What You Make Of It!;OK..
4;Reviews that are short and to the point. (no magazine articles here);"These are 4 1/2"" rectangles of peanuts  and a bit of almonds & cashews.<br />The first TEN ingredients listed on the package are:<br />peanuts, corn syrup, crisped rice, peanut butter, sugar, almonds, cashews, salt, honey, and vegtable oil."
5;yummmmmmmmmm!;we love this pancake / waffle mix.  It's hard to please everyone but this item does the trick.
5;Great!;I really like the variety. Hence, it is a variety pack.
3;Not enough sugar;The first time we ordered the Cinnamon Sugar, we received Pumpkin Pie Spice.  We were told to keep it at no charge.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
5;Organic Sprouting Seeds;I've just gotten back into sprouting again. This is the best seed product I've used yet.
5;#1 Coconut Oil IMHO;Taste is Delicious! Creamy, smooth, healthy, non-greasy, moisturizing, fragrant. No other coconut oil compares.
4;Tastes Like Ritz Crackers;I agree with the first reviewer, that they are mostly broken up pieces. Approx 15% may be whole & intact.
5;Excellent - Hard Salami;"When they say ""hard"" salami they really mean it.  Has great texture as a result."
4;Grade A Amber;The company should have put the grade in the description. You can see the grade if you enlarge the photo of the container and zoom in.
5;these are good, best in years;Not sticky, taste so good, best I've had in years of local store buying, will buy again.  In my opinion kids will love'em.
5;Best tasting Protein bar;This is by far the best tasting low carb, low sugar high whey protein bar ever had. I recommend it.
1;"Missing the ""Muscatel"" flavour from the second flush Darjeeling Tea";"I had earlier purchased the same pack from ""Whole Foods"" and it was awesome. Hence I decided to save money by purchasing online."
4;Crumbs;Yes, it does taste like the same thing from the freezer. The process makes all freeze-dried food crack into a few pieces (eat outside for minimal mess, NOT the desk at work!).
1;I never write reviews, but this is ridiculous;I ordered two bags of this stuff from amazon and both arrives hard as a rock. This is not powdered PB and I find it ridiculous you cannot return defective food products back to Amazon.
2;What did I just spend my money on???;Ok, maybe I have just been spoiled by some gluten free cookies, I dont know but these were terrible.  I mean they were so dry and had no flavor at all.
4;Pretty decent coffee;While not a high-end coffee, the flavor/body are pretty good for the price (I caught it on sale, combined with additional discounts for subscribe and save
5;I love these cookies. Found them in Sherman .Texas need them in Centennial.Co. Albertsons had them in Sherman.  Sssooo good!!;Will always buy these if I can find them. Hate to have to buy from Germany.
5;NOM NOM NOM!  So good.;I leave it in my fridge overnight in organic half-and-half.<br />The other favors are great too.
4;Wow;Wow..
5;nice tea for the price;Maybe not the very best darjeeling but a very good price for a decent tea. I've had more much expensive brands that weren't as good.
5;Great Stuff;I bought this food as an additive to my dog's regular dry dog food.  My dog, who is actually quite large, has shown less and less interest in her dry food.
5;The Best Snack Bar I've Ever Tasted;I've started working out.  The trainer inists I eat something every few hours and it's hard when I'm at work or traveling.
2;Nasty tea debris everywhere!;When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile.
5;Delicious and sells out quickly at grocery store;This is the best chocolate bar I've ever tried.  The salty taste is in perfect balance with the chocolate.
5;1lb 7 OZ;MY BAD,  THERE ACTUALLY IS 23 OZ.  THE PRINT IS VERY SMALL.
5;Our favorite K-cup coffee so far.;We have had a Keurig in our office for just over a month, and have tried quite a few varieties of coffee K-cups. So far this is our favorite.
5;Great Stuff;As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality.  It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc.
5;Pooch Pleaser;I used to feed my dachshund Bo a pig ear as a treat after his evening meal. He liked it but it created grease spots on the carpet and added unnecessary body fat.
5;These mints will knock your socks off!!!;These peppermints are a whole new experience in mints.  Once you get used to these, any other brand or type of mint will be too bland and too sweet.
5;Chocolate! What else is there to say?;The tea has a good chocolate taste, I find I need to brew it a bit stronger than usual.  The tea bags are sealed in individual packets.
3;Hmmm, where do I begin?;These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy.
4;Handy Helper;"I would recommend this product!  With the introduction of another cat to the household, this one from ""the outside"", this product has really helped.  I put it in the water dish for general comsumption and in the food of the oldest."
5;YUM;On my trip to the dominican republic this summer we did an excursion into the mountains and were able to buy raw cacao beans straight from the growers. The beans were fantastic
5;My doggy loves this!;This is my doggy's favorite dental treat. He loves it.
4;I like that it's grain-free, but it's awfully expensive;I know that grain-based foods are bad for cats. In the wild, they eat meat, not wheat.
5;Delighted!!;I sent a case of Duke's Mayonnaise to my daughter who recently moved to Long Island and, horror of horrors, couldn't find Duke's Mayonnaise.  Please understand that both of my offspring know that there is only one mayonnaise and that's tart and flavorful Duke's.
1;emeril's;Don't like it at all, can't even give it away.  I wasted my money.
1;Barely a Hazelnut Flavor from Gloria Jean;Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers.
5;Veggies Crunchies are the best;My son is 22 months old and has been eating these veggie crunchies for over a year now. I never thought to look on Amazon for food items and I'm so glad a did!<br />They are a fantastic price, very fresh and were delivered quickly.
5;multi-purpose mints;"Liquorice Altoids are the most versatile ""candy"" I have ever tasted. They are delicious as as a candy, breath mint, help with nausea and stomach acid."
1;Chemical Aftertaste;I purchased this coffee with high anticipation after I heard it being raved about by the morning radio DJ's.  I was disappointed when I received and tried it for myself.
5;looks good;Got this as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend.  He hasn't tried it yet, but I'm trusting he'll love it.
5;Excellent Quality Food - Good Savings on Large Cans;Like another reviewer, I also feed this food to my cats.  I recently contacted Nature's Variety by email and they confirmed that the cat and dog Instinct canned formulas are exactly the same.
5;SO convenient for Meyer Lemon fans...;I'm a huge fan of using Meyer lemon juice in just about everything. But the fresh fruit can be really hard to find, especially during the off-season.
1;no stars;I HAVE BOUGHT SIX PLANTS FROM HIRTS GARDENS. ONE WAS INFESTED WITH MEALY BUGS & THRIPS, 2 WERE SENT BENT ,BROKEN DUE TO NOT PACKING THE PLANT CORRECTLY, MOST OF THEM HAD BROWN DRY LEAVES AND EVEN LEAF SPOTS.
4;Big Taste in a Small Package;Move over, jellybean. There's a new kid in town who can pack a complex taste in a deceptively simple-looking candy.
5;Better than soda!;My 13-year old loves this stuff, and it is better for him than soda.  I only wish it wasn't so expensive!  We can get a better deal on Izze at Costco, but he doesn't like it nearly as well.
3;check expire date;I love this coffee but the expire date is 12/2010..
1;Where's the taste?;I was expecting a real zing. I've had Basque food before and it was great.
4;Morning coffee;I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor.
5;These kick Oreos in the Behind;"I'm not sure what ""Hipcat 21"" is referring to, but the Tim Tams I just ate from Australia would be pretty darn hard to suck milk through. They are a layered wafer cookie, and you'd have to have the suction of a Hoover vacuum to pull milk through those babies."
5;Quality beans, good price;All the beans were moist and plump, not dried out. Extremely fragrant.
5;orange spice in black tea is great;This is the finest tea we've ever tasted, good any time of the day, or night for that matter. We'll be enjoying it for many months.
1;95% imagination, 5% cheddar cheese flavor;Yup you might taste cheddar if you do not mind dumping 1/2 bottle in your popcorn. You would be better off purchasing a good brand of cheddar cheese and grating it on top of your popcorn.
2;Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!;I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.
2;Didn't really enjoy them;"After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so ""happy""."
5;Natural hog casings;Product was very easy to use even for a first timer. Great quality and would recommend this product for novice or experts.
5;LOVE this coffee!;This is our favorite brand of coffee..
4;Diet dog food that my dog likes!;My German Shepherd is a wonderful friend. But she has a tendency to carry a little extra weight (not enough to be any great problem, but enough that the vet wanted her to lose a few pounds).
5;Just want one bottle and don't have time to head to china town;Perfecto, reasonable price for one bottle (and prime!) and saved me a bundle of time: it is spicy so try it in a small amount before squirting more.  Has a direct 'hot' flavor with little weird after taste.
5;Claxton Fruit Cake;Thee best fruitcake ever!  Filled with fruit and nuts.  Moist.
5;My dogs love these!;These treats are an absolute MUST for my dogs. They would probably stop eating dog food if I gave them more of these, but one nice aspect of these treats is it tells you on the back how many they can have (by dog's weight) daily.
5;Very good and addictive!;I'm always leery when buying a new food item, but my fears were unjustified when it comes to this wonderful treat.  Very addictive, and definitely put me in a better mood for the day.
5;My Favorite Go-To Snack;When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.
5;These are the Cat's Ass....;I've purchased several of these as gifts for people and they all collectively think they're the Cat's Ass.<br /> For all of the individuals that rate this product in the 1 through 4 categories due to its flaws in either manufacturing design and/or dripping/spillage problems, should really read the directions that came with the product in their entirety.
5;Super Good Food;I only feed my cats natural organic types food with no cereal fillers and more protein. They LOVE this brand.
5;Im cherries over this frosting....;This is a must have frosting i buy a white cake mix and put the juice of a small jar of cherries in the mix and then use the cherries on top of the cake frosting..
5;dogs love them;all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog.
5;Yummy!;I just recently found Terra Chips and have sampled quite a few.  I really like these chips because they seem to be more textured than some of the others.
3;Beth;"The game was decent, but there are so many ""strip"" cards in the deck and on the board that we got all the way to naked before my boy even pulled a ""draw this"" card!  Neat idea, meh on the execution.  Make sure you don't mind messing up the sheets."
5;Ahhhh...;This coffee is so smoothe.  I brew my morning cup with the medium cup size and it is delicious.
3;Sweet carbonated juice;"The Switch Watermelon Strawberry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a ""flavored water"" type product."
5;Great flavor, very filling;I've looked and looked for a decent granola cereal, finally found it in this.  You actually feel full when you are done with a bowl, and the flavor and texture are perfect.
4;Cheaper at Sams Club;I love this product but I would not buy it online because you can get it much cheaper at Sams Club. It works great without the crash like you would after an energy drink wears off.
5;Must have!!;In this economy with the potential of the Dollar collapsing, every home should have bread flour.  These wheat berries when grinded, will produce the essential Bread flour needed to make bread.
3;Unimpressed;Omaha Steaks 8 (5.75 oz.
5;Fantastic;Tastes Better than the rest and has just as much jolt as other shots. This is what we should be paying, no sense paying for 5hr's advertising.
5;Delicious, and it does seem to cut my appetite!;I love this stuff, and am now moving to the 3 pack with different flavors.  I love to make it the day before and have it iced when I get home from work.
5;people coffe;Great value and taste.  The coffee taste is bold and not bitter.
5;Still My Favorite;I used to love these cough drops when I was a kid. I haven't seen them in stores for a while, so I decided to order them from Amazon.
5;Love this shampoo;I really like this shampoo.  It does a wonderful job on my goldendoodle and German shepherd mix.
5;lean body;Simply excellent! Great tasting and works. I have been using this for months with success.
5;Paula Deen Garlic Sea Salt;Paula Deen's Garlic Sea Salt is awesome!  I purchased it in Big Lots for $1.60 :( they no longer carry it.
2;not worth the money at all;these tomatoes look pretty in the can but lack flavor throughout.  you are better off buying premium brands for less at the grocery store and buying organic canned tomatoes.
4;Best Snack Ever!;We were given a bag of these from some college kids who were thankful we delivered something for them as they did not have a truck.  They sat on the counter for a while before I tried them and then - they were addictive!  There are 24 smaller bags inside with maybe a Tablespoon or two full of hot peas inside each.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
5;yummy gluten free bread;The first loaf was a little confusing, but then I caught on! This can be made by oven method or bread machine - both instructions are on the box.  After I mixed it and let it rest I was concerned that it only was as high as the bread pan.
5;Suprisingly yummy...great texture!;My daughter wanted to try these because she used to love jerky type snacks prior to becoming vegetarian. I have tried other brands of veggie snacks similar to these so I did not have high expectations.
5;BBQ Pop Chips are AMAZING!;I love these chips, they are healthier than regular ones and taste great. Lots of bbq flavor, not just a sprinkling like some other chips.
5;LOVE them;Lemonhead bring back the fondest of childhood memories..
5;DELICIOUS;The best popcorn I've eaten in a long time. Product arrived way before its expected time.
5;So Happy & Appreciative!;Great service and wonderful snacks! My family recently relocated to another part of the country and it's the first Father's day in many years that I haven't spent with my now 84 year old father. I wasn't used to shipping presents for Father's Day so I got started late.
5;"Better than ""real"" coffee!";I haven't been able to have caffeine for years, so I've been a decaf drinker. Recently, in an effort to reduce unhealthy things from my diet, I've been looking for a coffee replacement.
5;Sparkling Ice;I have tried the other flavors and this was a good addition and I like this product and would buy all that they make .  it makes you burp and has a great taste.
5;MY NEW FAVORITE DRINK !!!;"I used to be a strictly ""morning coffee"" person. NOT ANYMORE."
5;the best instant out there for me;I have to admit I'm a coffee snob, owning a semi-comm espresso machine at home and am heavily into all that coffee voodoo stuff.  Although I think Starbucks coffee is just so-so unless buried beneath lots of caramel and other stuff, I really like these VIA instants for some reason.
5;this stuff rocks;I love this product. It works so well for keeping me hydrated on my training runs for marathons.
4;Doggie topping;A nice topping for the picky eater.  Our dogs like the sprinkles<br />on their dry dog food.
1;DO NOT BUY! Made in china!!!!!;Another treat I purchased at the store for my dogs and did not check where they were made. They are made in china.
1;Tastes like licking a charred raspberry;Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.
5;Liquid Crack;If you like strong full bodied coffee then get this! This stuff is like rocket fuel. It tastes very good as well.
3;Cats love, I only like...;Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.
5;Wonderful;This is very good!, It has 5gms fiber which helps make you feel fuller,and 0 calories, low sodium. I love it.
5;A crowd Pleaser;This product has really made a difference. I break the ice around the hospital meeting visitors and employees alike and giving them a life saver.
4;Good;Yamamoto is a brand I always try to get.  This product is good.
4;Nice gift;I gave 2 of these for Christmas gifts, and thought they were nice..
3;Weak but okay;Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.
5;Yummo;For some reason the grocrey store in the small town where I live has stopped carrying Hormel Beef Tamales. I was so glad to find it on Amazon and on the subscribe to page.
2;Back to the standard version...;I found the taste harsh, odd off flavors, bad finish, not satisfying, and just not right.  I really like a very bold cup of well roasted and brewed Sumatra or Kenyan AA, but this Dark Roast I found very disappointing, and not a good example of the type.
5;The BEST, By Far!;Nothing--and I mean nothing--compares to Click. The creater of this product is a genius-espresso AND protein? And chocolate? Wow.
4;Pretty decent;"(These are the medium anti-oxidant ones)<br /><br />Our dog likes these well enough.  She's not ""crazy"" about them, though."
5;My dog actually liked the flavor!;"Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were ""bacon"" flavored and dogs love them."
5;Best cat food ever?;Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.
5;So good;I love it. Had to order more it was so good.
3;Good, not great;Almonds in this product are quite good.  The coating is well-bonded, and they are neat to eat.
5;love it, you too ?;great, love it, you too ? got to try it, guess every coffee is different, and how we like them too. but, if rich, strong, but not acidic, or caustic.
5;Good Stuff;The cooked grains are soft and creamy. Taste somewhat between a risotto and a barley.
2;Not my favorite Green Mountain;I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent.
5;Easy to use and easy to clean;We bought this to make baby food with fruits and veggies we get at the farmer's market.  It is so easy to use, and clean up is fast.
5;Yes, I love Rockstar;"I was surprised that many thought this was different then the ""regular"" Rockstar. Double strength refers to the size of the can, not the ingredients."
5;LOVE LOVE LOVE!!;My dogs are healthy & strong on this food. Love the ingredient list! Highly recommended by a local holistic pet store.
5;GREAT INCENTIVE TO GET DOGS EATING DRY FOOD!;As you have probably read, these treats are not like most others.  You cannot overindulge your pup with them because of their richness.
5;Lovin Eggnogg'n;I was not a frequent tea drinker but found one tea bag of eggnogg'n in a holiday basket sent to our office and fell in love with it. I search for it in stores but found I could only order it online by the case-amazon had the best price so far.
5;Cat Heaven;Wonderful product in many ways.  Cats coat are shedding less and beautifully silky.
5;Glittering Glamorous Edible Gold;I love this product.  It adds such drama and elegance to a variety of foods and beverages and is so simple to do.
4;nice toy;I like this toy.  My puppy dog cant figure it out yet, but she is young yet.
5;Heavenly;"I've used this as a moisturizer for my scalp and for my body for a little over 1 month now. It has stopped my scalp from becoming dry and flaky like it used to do, yet it's light enough to not make my hair greasy (I have relaxed hair with the usual ""new growth"")."
5;Fantastic!!;I searched long and hard for this product and I was thrilled to learn that they had the exact ice bars that I was searching for. The customer service was the best and shipping was extremely fast!!! Thank you for making a hard to find product in the U.
1;Dogs didn't eat them :(;I was excited to buy this peanut butter treat for my two small yorkies, they'll eat practically anything, but when i gave them the biscuit they just sat, smelled it and looked at me, then looked at the treat, then looked at me again..
5;*****Great Product*****;This is an awesome product. A friend of ours supplied us with a case of it after my 7 year old daughter was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme(the most aggressive type of brain cancer.
1;No flavor, coffee or otherwise;This coffee is extremely weak and the added flavoring for the Creme Brulee is weak also.  Not worth trying.
1;Too thick & Dry;My baby is 8 1/2 months old.  The texture is extremely thick & it's also very dry.
2;cans always seriously dented;I have ordered these twice and both times the cans were really messed up.  Usually not a problem, but if the seal is distrubed it could cause you to get sick.
5;This is my second one;If you love having your coffee your way you need one of these machines. Bought my first one (Spidem) about 4 or 5 years ago after visiting a relative and recently bought my second one for the motorhome.
5;Yummy & Fun Allergy Friendly Snack;Great product.  Tastes great and fun to eat.
5;A refreshing natural taste..feels like straight from a tropical beach;No need to read reviews and search any more..
1;Not at all happy with this;I would give this a zero star if I could. It's terrible.
5;Hill  O Beans;"Great low carb alternative. I mix them with ""Ranch Style beans"" to get a fairly low carb dish with better flavor than the Black Soy Beans alone."
5;Perfect cup in the morning;I do not like most of the light or medium blends (I get a cup of coffee that is too week from my Keurig)
2;Sloppy, disgusting mess;This product is just gross. The whole thing is a sloppy, floppy mess.
4;Excellent!;I had no idea how this product would turn out, but I put it in fruit smoothies and it's amazing.  Tastes great--I put in two scoops and et voila, the smoothie is delicious.
5;As close to Bone Fish Bang Bang as you can get;My husband and I are Bone Fish Bang Bang Shrimp nuts!  We order it often.  I am a recipe hound and am always looking for copy cat recipes and this is it.
5;Chicken Nibs;My two little guys loves these.  They are a great treat for training.
2;don't like taste at all;I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.
5;Better Bowls;I use this product in making Tiramisu. I prefer using this because it is made with splenda as opposed to aspartame which is in most of the other sugar free pudding products.
5;Great Icing;This frosting is great, especially if you want to use black but don't want it to taste bitter.  The only thing I don't understand is the price.
1;Too Sweet;Many people seem to love this tea, but it wasn't for me. It was much too sweet & there were too many competing flavors.
1;Beware the after effects;I recently tried this product to see how it compares to honey, I put honey on my pancakes and waffles as a slow glycemic alternative to syrup. The Blue Agave was posted at a lower price in the store and I wanted to give it try.
5;My favorite tea;My Keurig is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I don't drink soda, I drink tea instead and Mint Medley is my favorite.
5;Nice and Mellow;I have to say that this is becoming an every morning favorite for me. It is not pretentious.
5;great with chicken!;I used to cook chicken with my own sauce which takes more time and effort.<br />since i know this sauce my cooking time has been noticeably reduced and everything just got easier.
5;Best water I have ever tasted.;I have a Pur faucet filter so I usually do not buy bottled water. At a local store the 1L bottle was on sale so I got one thinking how different can it be.
2;flat fig newtons;If your a fan of dry cookies/crackers, then look no further. Think of these new lil snacks as a flat, dry fig newton.
5;Healthy but Delicious;It's  not too sweet so it tastes great.  I don't like any nut butter that is sweetened with sugar.
5;Really good;I was a bit skeptical about this soup being any good but when I prepared it I found it quite enjoyable and easy.  Perfect for a quick lunch on the go, or with a nice toasty grilled cheese sandwich.
5;Must have, no joke;"I do not think I can go a day without it.  It is very nice feeling ""normal""."
1;Just enough xylitol to charge extra...;There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here. The ingredients list for this gum starts out like this: sorbitol, maltitol, gum base, mannitol, xylitol.
5;So far, so great!;When my cat was diagnosed with high thyroid, he was destined to take pills daily for the rest of his life, at least 5 more years.  I told the vet that if I had to give him 2 pills a day, the cat would hate me.
5;just right;I can't find anything wrong with this product. Hot and spicy, but not to hot.
5;Great Scones~;Our family is so hooked on this scone mix..
5;Actually, far from great value for money...;By the time you read this, the subject of this review will likely be changed. This item has a list value of $33 -- it is being offered by a single seller here for $48 -- an approximta 50% price-hike on list.
5;Best green tea;It certainly is a best green tea I have ever had. I would usually put two tea bags of any other green tea in a small cup and this Japanese Sencha is so strong that I typically add extra water to each cup.
5;Colorful Gel Paste;Always hard to find that right color of orange at Halloween.  Glad to find this product available.
5;Great tea and delivery!;This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.
4;I was addicted to this stuff for a while, but wore myself out;It's high-quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe-and-save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  I'm not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you're using it as a work-out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.
5;Wonderful;I tried this as waffle mix and put it into my waffle iron and it turned out really tasty. I added coconut milk to thin it just a bit but the thicker the batter the fluffier it will be.
5;Good stuff!;We have been using this for a while with our 5 Bichons and it's great.  Organic, looks and smells fine, no stomach problems, delivered free, great price at Amazon.
5;Awesome Deal;Considering what these K-Cups cost in grocery stores, this deal was one too good to pass up.  Thirty-six for $15.
5;Baconnaise is Awesome!;"J&D's Baconnaise is amazing. I love it! I will order it again and again! The Bacon Salt rocks too! <a href=""http://www."
5;Review of Hain Baking Powder;This baking powder is low sodium.  It works as well as regular baking powder in muffins, waffles, pancakes, etc.
5;flowergirl;I ordered this plant along with the red and green leaf prayer plants.  All arrived packaged very well.
4;A unique flavor for fans of Thai food;"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."
5;Adult food.;Whoever said these are only for babies. I LIKE EM TOO! They're perfect for small munchies like me.
5;"the best ""san marzano"" tomatoes";I've been buying these San Marzano style tomatoes for at least ten years now.  The can (I've got one in front of me as I'm writing) actually gives no information at all on where they come from, so I don't know on what basis one reviewer claims they are grown in California.
5;Good price;I order this coffee for work all the time through Amazon and it's the cheapest and best around. I will continue ordering.
5;So Far, So Good.....;Since I got this for my elderly, frail cat who turns up her nose at a lot of canned food, I guess I'll rely on her judgment for the review.  She thinks it's pretty good.
1;Incorrect information;At the time of purchase, the production description stated:<br /><br />Blue Diamond Natural Cinnamon Brown Sugar Oven Roasted Almonds 8 oz<br />by Blue Diamond<br />Be the first to review this item  Like (0)<br />List Price: $32.55<br />Price: $6.
5;Ah, the joy;Ah, the joys of peppermint tea! Not only does it taste great and sooth the stomach, but for me it is currently working to deter a squirrel from eating my porch! I researched methods of detering squirrels and peppermint was suggested. I have sprinkled my porch with it and no more nibbling beastie--at least for now.
5;gravy;good stuff. i use it often.
5;Rice eating family;My family likes to eat healthy & we watch the aomount we eat. What we miss is pasta, potatoes & all the good starchy foods, but rice is good & heathy for you so when we find a interesting& healthy food of course we want to try it.
5;Awesome!;Yummy for my tummy..
5;Every morning;I drink a cup of this every morning, with milk added.  It's just wonderful.
2;Meh....;"I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very ""meh"" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it."
5;Theater Popcorn;This is the second different brand of this type popcorn that I have purchased because we didn't like the first brand.  This brand is very good and we will continue to purchase it.
2;They are good when they don't come moldy...;I used to order 5 packages at a time to save money and while they are tasty, every time they got here (and I opened them right away) at least half of them were moldy. No thanks.
5;if you love licorice;Could make myself sick on these.  IF you love licorice these are like being a kid in a candy store.
4;A bit different, good ginger, very hard snaps!;These are a bit different than your average variety ginger snap.  With actual bits of chewy, candied ginger and strong spice that's zingy with a hint of a bitter aftertaste.
5;"Fancy Feast.....kitty ""crack""";Cats love this stuff.  My Fancy Feast cat is now 14 yrs old.
5;Perfect for my picky pup;It was hard to find a raw food that my yorkie would stick too and because we traveled it made it even more difficult! Thankfully stella & chewy was the only food that she ate and have continued to eat for months! Also its so easy to travel with because so it makes everything super convenient. Also her transition from her previous raw was smooth and she had no problems with her stools.
5;Nutty whole grain goodness - Yummy!;This rice has a nice nutty flavor.  It isn't bitter like some brown rices.
3;it's okay but nothing to write home about;I love Cameron's French roast, I love the quality of it, the high roast on the bean, love the overall flavor.  So I thought we'd enjoy their lighter roast too when we want a less robust coffee.
5;Great Value;My dog loves this food.  He was previously eating Iams, which I did like, but it became hard to find.
3;Started out okay, but became a lost cause.;This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.
5;One of the Best Dressings Around!;I was a little reluctant to try this dressing when my best friend suggested it some time ago. However, once I tried it, I was hooked! I originally tried the regular and decided to also try the light.
5;Bow wow review of Dog Biscuts;I have 2 sixty pound American Staffordshire Terriers, aka Pitt Bulls. Mugsy and Spookey seem to realy enjoy the Biscuts.
5;A great alternative to Bovine juice;Every flavor of this Hemp milk is delicious though I prefer the unsweetened Vanilla version. I strongly reccomend it as a buy, but.
5;Great price.;This is my husband's favorite so the price was great for 50 K-Cup.  It gets expensive otherwise and who can keep running back to the store each time.
3;brown rice;I must say the rice is easy to make and good tasting. The only problem I had was with the calories.
1;Pricing Dept Insane;I buy these cookies from Walmart for $2.50, which periodically drops down to $1.
5;Aromatic;The first difference I noted was that it was more aromatic than the dark roast I normally purchase.  Nice coffee.
5;Finally found my cuppa joe.;UPDATE: try this: 23 grams of beans, 354 grams of hot water..
5;Best cookies I've ever had.;I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite.
5;Very realistic looking orchid;This orchid looks exactly like the natural one, of the very same kind, I have. I have them sitting next to each other and can hardly tell them apart.
2;Might Be Good For Smaller Dogs - Not My 3 Large Ones.;I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.
1;I'll NEVER order from Fruit Company again...;I buy gifts like this quite often. As a professional speaker I send them right after my programs, to thank the companies who hire me.
5;Hot chocolate in seconds;My brother owns a Keurig one cup coffee maker, which is an amazing device. I, however, don't drink coffee.
5;Great purchase!;This was a great value. My kids ask for this soup everyday and so it was a no brainer to buy in bulk.
1;THEY DISOLVE TO QUICKLY;I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND LIKED THE TASTE BUT THEY DISOLVE INSTANTLY AND I WAS CONSUMING THE WHOLE BOX AT ONE TIME. I WILL NOT PURCHASE THESE TABLETS AGAIN.
2;Great taste, horrible price;Taro is a purple potato that has a very subtle taste normally.  When it's combined with a creamy and sweet flavor, its taste gets enhanced substantially to get something very unique and pleasant.
5;Try it, Keep Buyin it;These are really good, even though they ship it as a kid item..
5;I really like it;After long research and many other brand and I found this one is the winner.  The price is right and flavor is really nice.
5;Healthy and very delicious!;I can't eat spaghetti with gluten, and this spaghetti fits what I'm looking for. It has organic corn and most importantly has quinoa in it which is a complete protein.
5;Ruta Maya Organic Cubita is my favorite bean of the 3...!;I've tried these 3 Ruta Maya coffee beans-<br /><br />1. The Medium Roast is Very light, and compares nicely to a Breakfast type Blend (too bland for me).
3;contains WHEAT!!;We love Newman's products..
4;I am neither Hansel nor Gretel;Seriously, this is a very good granola bar--taste, texture, size, etc. I would only suggest that the crumbs be retrained at the factory so that they can restrain themselves from raining down within the package, from the package to the plate, from the plate to the lips, but rather dive happily down upon my taste buds, which, after all, belong to the person who purchased the entire bar for that purpose.
5;Half-Caff;Love this coffee, most k-cups are stronger than we are used to having with a regular coffee pot. So this is perfect.
4;Probably the best of the grocery store dog food;I think if you are buying random dog food at the grocery store the Purina Beneful is probably one of the best available. If you're truly looking to buy the BEST dog food, then you're not shopping at the grocery store in the first place.
5;Yum;Bought this box of chips as a Father's Day gift because Dad loves them.  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
5;HOT CEREAL;ON A COLD WINTER DAY, THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START IN THE MORNING. FOR HEALTH REASONS, I ADD FRUIT AND NUTS TO THIS MIX.
5;YUMMY;THESE ARE GREAT. MY KIDS LOVE THEM AND THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME LOOKING AT THE ANIMALS.
4;The finest tea in the world;Last 3 years I am using this tea
4;"Good, but not enough 'Cookie"" in the cookie for me...,";This review is for the Peanut Butter Fudge Cremes. I love sweets! Chocolates , cakes , pie, ice cream and COOKIES! I was looking forward to trying these.
5;I love it.;I love the flavor.  No bitterness, just rich dark coffee.
4;Great but a bit pricey;I don't really feel I need the additional vitamins very much, so I prefer the version of Splenda that contains fiber instead, but this is very good also. The vitamin C in it seems to give it a bit of extra tart/sweet sensation.
1;Terrible, dog acted strange and poor ingredients;I had a terrible experience with this food.  I had fed my large Golden Retriever Science Diet adult food for most of his life, then when he was around 6 years old, gradually transitioned him to this light kind because he was getting overweight.
5;love it!;Wonderful product.  I am an avid baker but lately the cost of bean is so high, it is prohibitive to me to use.
4;Pretty Tasty, but Not as Good as Valdosta;The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.
1;It's hollow!;My dogs are 55lbs and 25lbs, within a few days they chewed through this bone which started to fall to pieces because it is hollow. If your dog is not a super chewer it might be good for them, but if your dogs gnaw nylabones into shanks like my dogs do, I would not recommend this.
5;The only thing all my cats will eat!;I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss.
5;Great Taste;Everyone in our family liked these chips.  Great taste and healthy compared to other chips.
5;coconut oil-multiple uses.;I use this for my dry scalp and it works well.it disolves into hair & scalp.
5;This is an exceptional bouillon maker that is healthy for you to use!;We use this bouillon to add to our meals for multiple reasons.  Whether it is chicken of beef flavored it adds flavor to your meal without adding fat and provides an ideal bouillon to use to make gravy with or to use as a basting sauce to roast or broil your meat in.
5;i really love it;i use to live in hawaii and all of sudden i found out coconut drink in can.  i saw lot of reviews with other products so i came with Amy and Brian coconut drink and Taste of Nirvana.
5;British Tea;British Tea is undoubtedly the freshest and finest green tea. It comes in a variety of flavors including natural, strawberry, lemon, mint, jasmine and Earl Grey.
5;Delicious with a unique flavor;This exotic fruit juice is sweet with a very unique, actually nutty flavor that reminds one of the direct relation of the cashew apple to the nut we're all familiar with.  It's a great way for those of us who don't live in the tropics to experience the flavor of this very perishable fruit.
5;One of the best bulk teas;I have been drinking PG tips bulk tea for at least 5 years.  I first learned about it by asking someone who had lived in England for a few years which English tea they liked best.
5;Proof in the plants, placebo effect not possible! See youtube video link.;Long, but worth the read, I promise!<br /><br />My very first introduction to Mr Trivedi was last year when I heard him on a radio interview. I was skeptical, but very hopeful, because they said there was scientific testing behind the Trivedi Effect.
5;LOVE!!;Rockstars taste literally disgusting and so unhealthy now after drinking these.  It's my go to afternoon pick me up.
5;Delicious;I bought the two-pack of this Spiced Chai mix on May 7th, and here it is almost exactly one month later and I've already run out and am back here ordering more.  It's very good, much better than I thought it'd be.
5;A Kitchen Staple I Always Have On Hand;Pastene Ground Peeled Tomatoes are always on my pantry shelf.  They are _fairly_ low in sodium (85 mg in 1/4 cup), have no peel as filler, and contain no nasty additives.
5;good stuff;I take this and I also give to my dog who has had yeast issues, and I read that coconut oil helps rid the body of yeast. I love that they are all natural.
4;My cats like this;My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite, Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.
5;Best Cranberry Tea;I have used this tea for years to help promote overall good health.  I combine it with their Green Tea (1bag of each to 2 cups hot water).
5;Great product!;This is a fantastic product! I have a very special lab that needs pills twice daily.  I have recently tried Pill Pals and am so pleased.
5;Excellent Chocolate;This is probably the best dark chocolate that I have eaten.  85% is definitely something one has to acquire a taste for, but once you're there, this is outstanding.
3;Unremarkable;First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend
5;These are very hearty and tasty chips!;I found these in Salt & Pepper flavor in huge 20 oz. bags for $2.
4;Perfectly acceptable popcorn!;Got a box of 10 on sale
5;BETTER THAN TEA BAGS!;this is some of the best tasting english breakfast tea i've ever had, it is honestly better than steeping a teabag, and this price!?  unbeatable, dont even think about it for another secon..
5;GREAT NATURAL PRODUCT FOR DOGS;I usually do well when I order Zuke's dog treats. They are natural without a lot of unnecessary ingredients.
5;Better quality and price than grocery store vanilla;Since the ingredients weren't printed on the Amazon listing, I contacted the manufacturer and asked before purchasing. I received a prompt, courteous, accurate reply.
1;Did not taste good;The portion was small, did not fill the bowl, and did not taste very good.  Not worth the money in my opinion.
5;Love This Coffee!;This is my favorite coffee. Perfect level of strength.
1;Discusting;Nasty Nasty Nasty. I threw them out.
4;Great every day chocolate avail at my drugstore;This isn't what I'd consider a premium chocolate like Godiva, but I like the intense orange flavor and the fact that I can buy it at my local drugstore on a whim. I keep it in the refrigerator and enjoy a piece a couple of times a week.
5;Tastes fantastic!;This product IS truly amazing.  It tastes wonderful, has organic ingredients, and helped to increase my energy levels and cut down my cravings for desserts and sweets.
5;My dogs love these;I received the bully sticks quickly and they were just as described.  My dogs love these and there is very little or no smell to them at all.
5;Red Clam Sauce;This is a very rich clam sauce with lots of flavor and incorporated with plenty of chopped up clams,and oils. Great value for the price.
5;My Dog LOVES these;These are the absolute best things I have bought for my dog! We got them when she was a puppy and it was a savior. I really feel it got her need to chew on things out and not on shoes, table legs, etc.
4;Our Son Loves Them, Very Convenient;Granted, these are a little expensive, but they are very convenient for feeding while out and about or when you don't want to run the risk of food getting everywhere. We like that they are pure fruit and organic.
4;Typcial Starbucks, but the vanilla helps..;Starbucks is notorious for having a bitter/burnt aftertaste. Such is the case with their packaged coffee as well.
5;Dogs;The service was great.  The product is my dogs favorite and it's healthy too.
5;GREAT TASTE & NO GI UPSET;The original honey stinger, gold, is great.  It taste like honey and I have no GI upset with this gel as I did with the Clif Shot Bloks.
5;The Perfect Gummi Bear;"Haribo Gold Bears are the best gummi product on the market. While so many gummi products are too soft,almost mushy at times,these have enough resistance to make them truly ""gummi."
5;Primo Catnip;This is primo cat weed. Cats that can generally take or leave catnip can't resist the stuff.
5;Highly Recommended;I had never had Brazil nuts before these, but I have to say that I love them. They do have a very high fat content so you will have to be somewhat moderate.
5;Inexpensive great dry cat food;I was never a cat lover until our oldest one followed us home when we were in NY. She was over year old but only weighted less than 3 or 4 lbs when she first met us.
3;Pretty Good;The dogs liked these one's pretty well but they weren't totally excited over them. They are larger than I expected and they don't create crumbs or discolorations on the carpet.
1;Mandarin oranges from China;Horrible typical metallic tasting Product of China.  Would not have ordered if I had known they were a Product of China.
4;One of our favorites;Great coffee. You can taste both the vanilla and the caramel flavors.
5;Fun and good product;Good tasting gluten free product.  My granddaughter (who has celiac disease) likes the vanilla, and my grandson likes that chocolate.
5;Delicious;I am now officially addicted to these bars!! Excellent texture and taste! Will be buying them again and again. Wonderful for gluten free needs.
1;What Happened to the Rao's recipe;I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed.
3;Needs details;The description does not go into detail of the quantity that you receive. While for under $5, I did not expect much, I did expect to receive more than 6 paper thin slices.
5;The oils are different than the extracts... but I like them;I wanted to try oils over extracts, so I ordered this product.  Technically, it is supposed to compare to extract at 4x the density.
3;Inconsistent at best - too many hulls;I enjoy hempseed, primarily I sprinkle it over my salads to add a nutty and nutritious component.<br />I like buying this in bulk because it saves money over the expensive 1 pound or half-pound  bags I can get at the store.
4;Good every day green tea;We were looking for a decent economic green tea alternative to individual bags. This tea fits the description perfectly.
5;good replacement;My wife never liked the smell of my Mennen, but I could never find a substitute that worked. The Axe does: it's a mild scent and does the antiperspirant job well.
5;great stuff;Delivered smooth rich espresso with a truly awesome crema that was thick AND persistent.  Better yet, it does this consistently time after time without fuss.
5;I feel good about this formula;That pretty much sums it up.  I mostly breastfed my kids, but when we were ready to switch to formula, I felt good about this one.
5;Fresh tasting, good value;The health benefits are uncertain, but this is a nice variant of another favorite, Celestial Seasonings' Cranberry Apple Zinger. The Alvita tea is tart, light, and refreshing - and Alvita has a long history making healthful products that are also surprisingly good values.
5;Great Plantains;These are the best roasted, lightly salted plantain chips I have ever had.  I have tried many brands and these are the best hands down.
5;sunflower kernals;These are delicious. Fresh and not too salty.
4;Sweet/Tart natural flavor;Roland has a winner with this product. No heavy, sugary syrup, just fresh tasting tart yet naturally sweet flavor.
5;Excellent!;Crazy enough, I think this is cheaper to order through Amazon than buying it from a grocery store! They just come packaged in a normal box, but the packets clearly state refrigerate after opening, so they're safe. I'll definitely have to order this again.
4;Tangy, Convenient, AND It's Healthy;I got these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit snacks because I'm a fan of other Clif brand products (Clif Bars, Luna Bars, Luna Minis) and I'm always looking for healthy food that's easy to eat on the go.  Even though I'm not a kid, I do enjoy having convenient, go anywhere fruit that I can eat.
3;Beefy, but salty;The good: the beef is cut thickly and has a steak-y taste.<br />The bad: the jerky is extremely salty to the point that it made me feel ill if I ate more than a few pieces.
5;my favorite;This is my favorite morning tea. I like it full bodied so I leave the bag in until I'm finished.
1;too beady;i didn't like this product at all and ended up tossing it. the soft inner part of the candy tasted really good but the hard, beady outer part was a headache.
4;Good Basic Mix;I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great.
5;AMAZING!;I am a huge fan of Manchego cheese, so I ordered this sampler as an indulgence for my husband and myself.  It was delicious, and well worth the price.
5;Loved it for my child and I;Okay I am American..
1;Pet safe Lickety stik;"My dogs would not lick it or even pay attention to it. I thought it would be great for training as I am a consumate treat ""dropper"", but they were not the least interested."
5;Now I know why they call it the Ghost Chili;Like most Melinda's hot sauces, they aren't the hottest around. You CAN find hotter sauces made from the same pepper.
5;JBERTSIESFAVS;If you love the heavenly combination of chocolate and orange, then this<br />is a cookie to try.  Gotta have your coffee and treat everyday like moi.
5;Great travel snack!;We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.
5;Delicious and great value;This is a great flavor. It last a long time.
4;Very creative!;What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling).
2;Too much cinnamon!;This cinnamon flavor in this tea is overwhelming. It really hides any tea taste.
1;Far from luscious...;I have eaten other Pamela products and have been really impressed with the quality. I was really disappointed with the luscious chocolate cake mix.
5;Nongluten granola;"I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see ""without gluten"" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say ""gluten free oats"" but still I wondered about the other grains."
5;yummy!;Our dog loves these! Easy to break, smells good, and she seems very excited to have them. No complaints at all.
5;Tastes Great!;Tastes great, no bad smell as others mentioned. Came in 2 days with prime and no problems.
4;Too small for tall kitchen size;I love these bags, because I can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess.  But the 13 gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size.
5;Happy Dogs;The whole Household eats Olewo Carrots and Red Beets from the 110 lb Dutch Shepherd, 60 lb German Shepherd, 6.8 lb Chihuahua to the 3.
2;Not Identical to Starbucks Chai Extract;This is the same brand, but not the same concentration (and therefore not the same flavor) as the Chai extract used by Starbucks. The extract used by Starbucks is more heavily concentrated and therefore more intense in flavor.
1;good ceral at a _very_ high non-amazon-prime total cost;howdy y'all,<br /><br />i like this cereal. it is not _wonderful_ but it is tasty and nicely crunchy - if you don't let it sit for long.
5;My dogs love these;I have two labs that love these beef tendons. They are consumable and healthier for dogs than raw hide snacks.
5;Great taste, better then the competition!;Ive tried all the diet pop out there and I cant find anything that tastes as good as this. Hansen's is close but comes in second.
5;The best;"I have tried every ""good"" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****."
5;Retro gum;OK, its an acquired taste, but fun. It can be hard to find in stores, and is made by the old Adams company for almost 100 years.
5;a favorite;Have enjoyed many cups of this flavorful tea which was first given to me by a friend.  I have continued to order it on a regular basis.
5;Yummy!;My absolute favorite vegan chocolate bar.  Sad that my local natural food store no longer carries it, but happy to buy it by the box from Amazon.
5;Great Coffee;Nice aroma and is a great breakfast blend.  Strong enough but without the harsh after taste.
5;4 oz. Great American Popcorn Portion Packs;We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn.
5;no-flour bread;My wife and I (both 83 years young) constantly look for ways to keep our weight under control. This bread, made with sprouted grains is just one of the items that we enjoy.
5;Sweet deal, no off flavors.;If you're accustomed to Flax being added to your foods, this brand doesn't disappoint.  I use it with my oatmeal and it doesn't change the flavor or texture(at least that it's noticeable to me).
4;Good, Refreshing Pick-Me-Ups;I might as well review both Illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink & Illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink at the same time, since essentially the only difference is the additional lowfat milk and cocoa in the cappuccino. I am not a daily addict of high end espresso drinks, but I do have both espresso & cappuccino now and then - often Starbucks, but not exclusively.
1;Deceptive Description;I can't comment on the flavor since there was only 1 4oz packet sent.  The description is confusing and considering they are charging $27.
5;A new favorite!;"I received this tea 2 days ago and I must say I cannot sop drinking it11 It is so smooth and has such a beautiful aroma. Not too heavy on coconut but ""just right"" Try this but  I do recommend you get more than one."
5;Divine;I learned of this from Tim Ferris's book. Sprinkle it on anything, eggs in the morning, left over turkey, whatever and  suddenly everything you're eating is fine cuisine.
5;Excellent taste... but a bit costly;The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste.
4;Good flavor;These need to cook  a little longer than suggested. Do not make them too thick or the middle will not get done.
5;Excellent cat food!!!;We have an 18 year old cat and he had actually lost weight and didn't look too good.  At the time we were feeding him his usual excellent quality dry kibble.
3;Mild flavor, but a little acidic.;This coffee is on the mild side but a little too acidic for my tastes.  I will not order again.
4;Love popchips!;This is my least favorite flavor, I find it bland.  But these small bags are great for kids lunches, and a nice alternative to fattening chips.
5;Bahlsen Hit Cocoa Sandwich Cookies;These are very good cookies I enjoyed eating them so much that I gave some to my daughter and her boyfriend and they liked them.The chocolate filling provides just enough sweetness the cookies are not super sweet themselves.
4;Good Ethiopian With a Strong Taste;I actually googled this, so bear with me.  This is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, not Ethiopian Harrar, which apparently is different.
5;Dill pickle Cashews!;OK..
5;Wonderful product;I love this product. It is so filling.
1;CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!;If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.
4;Good but not great;It just doesn't have the amount of licorice flavor as the Aussie made product.  Or, for that matter, most other quality licorice products.
5;Best chili paste ever!;I CANNOT believe some people giving 1-2-3 starts JUST because the shipment/packaging was not good. This is a PRODUCT review, not a place to review UPS,FedEx or whatever company Amazon uses.
5;Very good product;I use this for my dog periodically as a maintenance product. She is 9 years old and has been taking it for about 3 years.
5;Boppy gives it 5 stars;Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.
4;Great BUT (!) My case came with BG can's in it instead of what I ordered!;We have used Merrick's cat food for umpteen years now. Price is great on here.
2;Not good...;I just received my shipment of this mochi yesterday and it tasted weird, not good at all. For clarification, I got the red bean and it comes with six in the package (I couldn't find anywhere how many were inside).
3;They were just ok;I am a big fan of the dried mangos at Costco (except that they have too much sugar coating), but I wanted to try these as well. They were just ok, the Mango pieces are very small.
4;Tasty, great for camping or fast breakfasts;I always find the Maple & Brown Sugar more tasty than making plain oatmeal with maple syrup and brown sugar myself. Why is that? Regardless, these instant oatmeal packs have been a staple breakfast for numerous camping trips -- just add hot water and it's ready to eat.
1;found hair and feathers in it, do not buy.;I don't know where they make this but I'm assuming they made this in someones backyard. I found a piece long black hair (kinda like horse hair) and feather, just completely disgusting ehhhh.
4;Smart fires for sure;They are great if you are on a diet and cant snack on unhealthy stuff.  The smart fries are a great snack fix.
2;Not quite sure what the point is.;When I first saw this product I thought it was an awesome idea.  Rooibos tea mixed with espresso beans.
5;yummy stuff!;I was  searching for vanilla sugar for baking like I had found in European brands of finely granulated. This is a delicious and similar in essence.
1;Not a 100% substitute;I ordered this because of the positive reviews here, and the description touting it as an almost 100% substitute for wheat flour.  It is not.
5;Best I've ever had;"I love this popcorn!  We use this corn in a traditional oil popper with the really ""bad for u"" coconut oil. I tried Orville reddenbacher after this just b/c it's cheaper, but never again."
4;Not for air poppers;When I bought this popcorn, it was because Amazon recommended it or at least showed it with the air popper. As other reviewers have said, this popcorn does not work in the air popper.
5;Kippers;These are very good. A very quick and easy source of fish oil and protein, as well as omega 3 and vitamin E.
5;If you have a chubby dog...;my geriatric beagle mix would eat herself into a coma if I didn't watch her like a hawk, so I was concerned that each pocket was 29 calories (which is a lot for a treat) so since she only has one small pill twice a day, I cut the pocket in half and squish the pill in it.  15 calories is still pretty steep, but it gets the job done for half the calories anyway.
3;Organic Fruit Review;This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine.
2;husband & wife opinion;Tonight my husband and I tried out Betty Crocker's Mac and Cheese, Grilled Cheese flavor. While I liked that the noodles were heartier than the ones from Kraft, my husband thought they were too stiff.
5;My Frenchie Loves This Food!;I've been feeding my French Bulldog puppy Wellness Super5Mix Just for Puppy since I brought my him home with terrific results.<br /><br />Wellness passed the puppy taste test with flying colors and my pup loves dinner time! He happily scarfs-down his entire meal during feedings.
4;Pretty good stuff;This is a nice blend of peaches and applesauce. But I prefer the one with cherries and applesauce.
1;Disgusting taste!;I was looking forward to trying these after all the great reviews - and especially as they contain great ingredients, and are gluten-free.<br />Unfortunately the stench released from baking - never mind the taste - was absolutely foul.
5;Long Time Fan of Bariani Olive Oil;I absolutely love Bariani Olive Oil robust grassy taste. I cook with it, fry with it, use it fresh from the bottle (great for dipping bread) and yes even put it on my skin as a moisturizer.
5;Ionic Separation to Improve the Taste of Your Water;Essentia uses a proprietary ionic separation process that removes acidic ions from the water. The result, presumably, is thinner, sweeter water.
1;Tried a different KOA coffee - tastes burnt;In desperation & frustration from buying (and throwing out) pound after pound of bitter & burnt coffee beans of various brands and types for several years now, I ordered some expensive KOA Kona coffee beans in the 4-pack of half-lb. bags.
5;Super Yum!;Light, crispy, super-tasty. Only disappointed that my grocer doesn't carry more of the flavors.
4;Not too bad;Kale has a really strong taste but with the cheddar it's not too bad. I think it's a great substitute for chips.
5;blackberry tea, through Amazon;The flavor of this tea is strongly berry and very tasty.  It can be make to<br />any taste strong or weaker.
1;Wish I never gave this to my toy poodle;These didn't work out for my little poodle. She started choking on them, I cleared a rough, hard piece out of her throat and then threw them out.
5;You can tell the difference.;Being a person who loves animals, I highly recommend this food. Never has my cat's coat been SOO soft and shiny.
5;Stepens Candycane Cocoa;If you haven't tried the Stephens Candycane cocoa you need to try it  but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors.  It's great tasting.
5;Is what it is!;Not much to say. The product is exactly what it is! A nice compliment to the kitchen counters.
4;Good hot cocoa mix, but....;I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.
5;loved it;great product.  actually we've used it all now.
5;Yum YUM!!!;I absolutly love this flavor Crystal light. I'm type 1 diabetic and have been drinking this stuff since I was 9.
4;I love this stuff;I loved this coffee soon as I opened the bag. Mainly it tastes as good as it smells.
3;The Kind Plus item was sticky;I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived.
4;Good assortment but does not contain every flavor;This version of the lollipop assortment has a good variety of flavors but there are a few that are not included such as the lemon, orange, and ginger. However, if you dont want to have to buy the full 5lb bag, this is still an acceptable assortment with a good variety.
1;Awful!;I love cookies and I love oranges.  These don't taste like either one, more like a collision of rancid oil, baking soda, and cardboard.
4;Treats to Keep Your Spoiled Friend Trim...;My little Boston terrier loves them
5;Tasty and filling!;"The flavor is robust and tangy, and the texture is very pleasing and moderately chewy - not enough to hurt your teeth, just enough to satisfy! Also, they're not salty-tasting at all. The ""jerky"" flavoring is moist enough to make a little mess on your fingertips, but you can suck it right off."
1;Do not buy...Old Stock;I've purchased Cobblestone Kitchens Margarita mix before from retail stores, and it's the best out there..
4;Decent Light Roast Organic;It seems most of the organic/shade grown/fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted, so I've been having a hard time finding something that I like.  While this doesn't wow me like some other coffees, it's priced cheaper than those coffees and it's a good brew for when I'm not really paying attention to what I'm drinking (like when I'm working).
5;Great coffee choice;Caribou is a nice coffee blend - full of flavor but not bitter.  A good choice for those who drink their coffee without cream or sugar.
4;works well, but is not a deodorant!;i think this product is worth trying. it KILLS if you put it on too soon after shaving, so be very careful.
4;Tasty!;This makes some great baked goods! I'm no baking expert but I can follow a recipe pretty well. So far I've used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles.
5;Critical ingredient in Cajun dishes.;Essential for gumbos, jambalaya, steamed fish, and &Eacute
5;Delicious;This is a great bar, we originally tried the coconut and almond but thought this one sounded good too.  The best part about these bars is they taste delicious and they are healthy.
5;Great Hot Sauce!!;This is a really awesome blend of peppers.  It is hot enough to satisfy people who like some heat, but not so hot that it takes away the flavor of the food.
4;Nice tasting tea;"I like this tea because it reminds me of what you would get in a chinese restaurant, the ""higher quality"" Oolong teas don't taste this way. I actually prefer this kind of Oolong."
5;AMAZING!!!!!;..
5;"Just what ""The Cat"" ordered.";"""The Cat"" will not eat anything else although he's been offered a varied menu.  It is all about him, I'm told."
5;Believe the name;Bought this to supplement recipes. Great to add to store bought chicken stock to deepen the flavor.
5;Mmmmm....vanilla.;I decided to make my own vanilla extract, so started shopping for vanilla beans. Based on the outstanding reviews here, I purchased 7 Vanilla Beans for what I found to be a great price.
5;Pretty tasty;I had picked up a container of these at the grocery story for the kiddo to try out and he loved them!  So I ordered a larger lot size on Amazon and we had been plowing through them.  Now I have them on a subscription so we get them regularly.
5;Cacao;This was exactly what I needed to make my morning smoothies.  I was thrilled to find this through Amazon and have it arrive quickly.
1;Stale product;My order came in a plain plastic baggy taped shut with no label and no packing slip. The nuts were stale.
3;Not the best flavor of BFF;My cat completely ignores this flavor. Instead of the normal slab of meat, like BFF's other flavors, this one is soupy, and apparently not very good.
5;Good product the second time around;I ordered regular Calm, and received Calm Plus Calcium.  These are different products.
4;Kitty cat crack;I got this to give to our cat as an occasional treat. Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict.
5;coffee;They had quick service and good prices. The item was exactly as described from your site.
3;Great Tasting But Disappointed They're Packed in Vietnam;I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.
5;Great coffee!;This is a full bodied, delicious blend of coffee. The package came quickly and in perfect condition.
5;Great snack;I was a little leery having to buy a box with 12 bags of popcorn.  LOL!  But I wasn't disappointed.
3;Love the Coffee - problems with the k-cup;EBEB is my favorite k-cup coffee flavor.  It has great flavor and is my preference for a bold coffee taste without being bitter.
4;Very good product for HCG users;This moisturizer is very good and doesn't make the skin feel greasy/oily, but gives great relief and soft feeling for those who have to avoid oily products while using HCG.  Highly recommend this product.
4;Pretty good;These granola bars are pretty good and healthy for you, but they are personally my least favorite out of the three granola bars that Kashi makes. I would recommend the Trail Mix or the Honey Flax Almond ones over these, but these are still an excellent choice.
3;mastifflady;I bought this product for my mastiffs and while is took them a couple of hours to eat it, it only took 20 minutes for my Boston to eat it. I was hopeing that it would last months not minutes or hours.
3;Wrong items in Amazon's Description;This is what you really get as per igourmet.com web site:<br /><br />Cheeses<br /><br />Paladin Blue from Germany (8 oz)<br /><br />Monte Veronese from Italy (8 oz)<br /><br />Camembert from France (9 oz)<br /><br />Red Leaf Cheddar (8 oz)<br /><br />Other<br /><br />Serrano Ham (3.
1;unpleasant aftertaste;Bought the coffee at Shop Rite expecting a nice brew.  This coffee had a very unpleasant aftertaste.
5;I'm in banana heaven on marshmallow clouds - yes, these are great!;Not sure why the other reviewer was unhappy, these are my favorite marshmallows.  A fantastic banana taste is captured in rich chocolate, you can never eat just one.
5;Greenie Pill Pockets;Great product.  My cats take their pills thinking they are treats.
5;On time - exactly as ordered.;This 2 pack was on time and exactly as ordered. I love Kona Blend, thank goodness I was able to find it on Amazon since there's a shortage.
2;Not too bad...I guess???;I have been drinking Earl Grey for a little over a year. Have tried several brands and this was not the best.
5;Love this coffee !!;I signed up for monthly shipments of this coffee.  I am so glad I did.
5;Poppy Seed Bread;My family loves poppy seed bread and I must say that these poppy seeds have the best flavor and they are so fresh. I keep one package in the refrigerator to use and store the rest in the freezer for later.
4;Quick Tasty Lunch;If you can't get away from your desk to go out for lunch or down to the cafeteria, this is a quick and easy way to have lunch.<br /><br />Preparation is stupid simple.
4;tasty;Had the sampler pack and I was impressed. Loved the Cyclone the most.
4;excellent powdered peppers;4 stars because the product description is terrible:<br /><br />-it's powdered, green, jalapeno peppers<br />-it's 16oz (1 lb) not 24oz<br />-it's one unit, not six<br /><br />However, it's worth it.  The price/oz is still great, compared to the 2oz crushed jalapeno spice jars you can buy at the supermarket.
5;Works exactly as stated.;I had heard about these little toys about 2 years ago from my oldest sister who has a Shar Pei. She told me he absolutely loved it and she had to take it away because he would be panting out of excitement from chewing on it.
1;Picture doesn't match description;I didn't actually order this but was sent it by mistake. In searching to see what might have happened, I found it and noticed that the picture doesn't match the description--and I can tell you from what I was sent, it is the description that is correct, not the picture.
5;AWESOME!!!!!;"I love click, it tastes great and mixes easily!<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Love having the ability to get a great cup of Pike without the trip out;Quick pick up when the office grind is wearing me down.<br /><br />A small taste of Seattle in every cup just need to get one of those comfy chairs in my office and I will be set.
5;Woodstock Farms Sunflower seeds, hulled, organic;This product was excellent.  I received my sunflower seeds three days after ordering.
5;Great product;The David Rio Sugar Free Decaf Chai mix is great and tastes great too. Very convenient packaging.
5;Good noodle;Bought from a local H-mart for 14.99.
1;Horrble;They tasted awful! I followed the directions step by step, took about 30 minutes to make them. The final product was not worth the time it took to cook them.
5;Fantastic AND Healthy;I am gluten intolerant and also need to lose weight (for which I am using Weight Watchers online points plan). It's difficult to find carb or bread items (including crackers) that are not worth too many points.
5;Autumn not Fall;Saw this product and thought of the times with growing up and coming home to warm Apple Cider.  This product is as close to that experience as I have had, and a whole lot more convenient.
5;Better than milk!;The milk tastes great, I've used it for several years.  What's even better, now that my local health food shop has discontinued it, is getting it on Amazon.
4;Yummy!;It is a darker roast than I usually get but it still has a great flavor.  I just have to add a little extra cream and sugar.
5;excellent snack!;These were a great snack! My entire family loved them, including my children. (9 and 6) Not too spicy.
5;Magnifico wine;This wine was easy to make, but let it age for a few months.  Yes, you can enjoy it soon after bottling, but it ages really well.
5;Delicious and soothing;I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.
4;Good price;Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.  I cut them in half because they are so expensive but I've been able to find them at much better prices on Amazon than in the pet food stores even with the manufacturer's infrequent coupon.
1;"STALE AND CAN'T RETURN BECAUSE OF A ""NO-RETURN"" POLICY";"I received this box of popcorn and ""STALE"" is an understatement.  The seller has a NON RETURN policy and I can't email them either."
5;Great Deal and Great Coffee;I love buying these in bulk because it's much cheaper in the long run. I got tired of buying the smaller boxes for $10 when I could buy 50 for $29.
5;Super carb friendly!!;My husband is diabetic and loves homemade lasagna.  Our local grocery store carries spaghetti,elbows and penne style pasta of Dreamfields.
5;Healthy Canned Diet;Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive.
5;My Cat's Favorite;The green bag fancy feast is my cat's favorite.  It's per pound cost is about the same as my local supermarket but the market only sells the 1 lb green bags.
4;My dog loves it... even though it smells a little... salmon-y.;We switched to the Halo dog food when my dog started having an allergic reaction to her previous, grocery store bought food.  After we switched, her reaction stopped, so I feel good about paying a little extra for this brand.
5;Pink Himalayan Course Grain Salt;I use this Pink Himalayan course grain salt in salt grinders because it looks great, but also I make my own homemade Herbal Salt using Rosemary, Lemon Thyme and Pink Himalayan course grain salt..
5;Was not expecting this!;Alright, I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much when I picked this box up off the grocery store shelf for $2.34.
5;comfort food;I grew up on grits, they were easy to find in Colorado but after moving to California they got harder to find. What a wonderful breakfast  with added cheese,crumbled bacon or sausage, very hardy meal.
5;Best House Blend;I am a picky coffee drinker and really like this House Blend by Tully. Very rich but smooth taste.
5;Tasty and simple;I purchased these to go along with Hamilton Beach Two Way Brewer Single Serve and 12 cup Coffee Maker.<br />The brewer was highly rated but the coffee pods meant to go with it were unavailable.
1;Not worth the risk;Both of my Golden Retrievers love these.  The older one eats it perfectly, tearing off little pieces at a time, chewing, swallowing.
5;aptly named product;Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer.
5;fluffy, crisp, good value;After doing some research on Amazon for the best reviewed microwave popcorn, I ended up going with the JollyTime.  I did not want a popcorn that was slathered in butter flavoring
5;Delicious nut bars!;I was surprised that these bars tasted so delicious - I found myself unable to stop at just one!  The bar is a loose conglomeration of nuts & soy, coated with honey.  Highly recommended as a low carb snack that will keep you full for hours.
5;waffle mix;This is the best waffle mix ever!  The mix is 5-star restaurant quality. Crispy and light.
5;so good...;After trying these at TJ's, i realized how awful pop-tarts tasted. These are much thicker and heartier, and they taste better! The membership warehouse store even has them for 8 bucks for 3 packs of 12, blueberry and strawberry.
4;reliable crystl light quality;We use a fair amount of Crystal Ligh in the summer months. When mixed as directed its a bit too sweet for my personal preference but adding a little extra water solves that problem and also gets you a little more drink for your money.
5;The best gluten-free bread!;This is the best GF bread I've ever eaten!  The mix is easy to use, with very clear instructions.  It does take a little time from start to finish, because it's yeast-risen bread.
3;Dye, tough package, decent taste;I haven't had licorice that tasted like this in years, and I still can't decide if that's a good thing. The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings).
5;Superb Is An Understatement;I had been drinking Cameron's coffee sold on Amazon and, well..
5;Andy Warhole in my Fridge;Art Deco in my fridge. Tastes great.
5;LOVE Mrs. Leepers!;Mrs. Leepers dinners are a favorite at our house.
3;Crown Prince places fewer sardines in each can;For years until my last purchase, Crown Prince placed five large Moroccan sardines in each can. Now, this company is putting solely three sardines of a slightly different appearance in each can, accompanied by a much increased amount of tomato paste.
5;CONVENIENCE COUNTS FOR CANINES & FELINES;THESE DAYS THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID OF THE CONVENIENCE IN BUYING SOME OF OUR GROCERIES ONLINE.  ESPECIALLY THE ITEMS YOU DON'T WANT RUNNING OUT AT ALL -- ESPECIALLY DURING THE SNOW MUCH OF THE U.
5;Yummy;I love this product. I can order it here for much less than buying it at my local grocery store.
1;I bet the packaging they came in was tastier...;Ok, ok, ok.  I know they are a healthier snack but OMG.
5;Great Coffee!;From the several makers of K-cup coffees I've tried, Black Tiger makes the best tasting cup of coffee!  It's robust, yet not bitter or acidic.  It's the perfect morning coffee for me.
4;Catit fountain;My cats love this fountain.  I have had it for 2 years and it runs continuously.
5;Great Instant coffee;Usually brew coffee but this is convenient for work. Coffee is great and the price is the best I could find.
4;Disposable cups a must;These cups are great. I have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top.
5;Newman's coffees are tops...;Most Newman's products are fabulous for many reasons, but especially their coffees - they are quite good. This particular decaf coffee is among our favorites and we have found it to be of very consistent quality and flavor without being too strong.
2;NOT the original L&P recipe - contains HFCS;As per the product listing, this version of Lea & Perrins' iconic Worcestershire sauce contains high fructose corn syrup. Heinz has actually listened to customer concerns/opinions and, as of this year, started using sugar in the recipe instead of HFCS in the US version again (see the product info on the L&P website - the ingredients are listed there) but unless and until the product information is updated I'd assume what's being sold here is still old inventory containing HFCS.
2;Buyer Beware!!!!;I have been trying for years to get my replacement part.  The part with the glass bowl in it broke.
4;Very,Very Good;This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine.
5;Perfect for training;These look and smell pretty tasty, no wonder my dog loves them. These are perfect for obedience training because you can hold a lot in your hand.
5;Oh my effing Lord;It's cat food. If you have a picky cat, or you just like to spend money on soft mushy food for your cat, then this is the food for you.
5;Great coffee, great price!;I have purchased coffees from coffee bean direct on numerous occasions and they have never disappointed!  The beans arrive very quickly and are well packaged and fresh.  Every variety I have tried has had great aroma and flavor.
5;Toasted Maple Nut.... Very good;I had this in my cart for a couple days thinking about it. It was real cheap (then) and no one had reviewed it yet.
3;Vanilla wafers -- beware they can melt in shipment!!!;These tasty chocolate coated wafers are a great way to get a chocolate fix without too many calories. Be warned however that if the weather is sunny and in the 70's or higher, you're likely to be disappointed when you open the box because the chocolate melts.
4;You Can't Hammer with a Nail with a Screwdriver ...;..
4;Pretty good to mix with other things..;I purchased this when I was on a big health kick a few months ago. It is actually pretty tasty.
5;Sayana;I will not buy any other brand of cocoa! LOVE this product!<br /><br />First came across it at Intelligencia in Los Angeles and had to get it. I have used it for frosting and baking and the taste is amazing.
1;These are made in China;These are made in China, the country that sent the U.S.
5;Kettle chips are excellent;Kettle is the best tasting and healthiest chips I have tried. Keep buying them so Amazon keeps stocking them.
5;Delicious Flavor;This is an amazing flavor.  I use it in my coffee and also I heat milk and flavor it in order to increase my calcium levels and help me to get to sleep.
5;Delizioso;I love this gnocchi.  I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but I'm trying to eat healthier.
5;My baby & toddler love this!;I originally bought this after my toddler had tried some squeeze pack apple sauce and enjoyed the novelty of it.  She likes applesauce anyway, but I thought I might be able to get her to eat some veggies if I could find them in a squeeze pouch too.
4;Larger pieces look like beef jerky shreds, small ones my cat likes!;"This food smells good, compared to a lot of dog foods, has beef, soy, potatoes & corn in it, but ell liked. My cat likes the little pieces (I'll have to do something about that to be sure it'k OK that she's eating to fog food, or put it up or something?)<br /><br />Not at all ""kibble""."
2;Good Product but not what I needed;The company that sells this product was very nice. The item was suppose or I thought it was gluten free.
5;Excellent afternoon tea with a distinctive flavor;This is available in many grocery stores too, and is partway between the cheap and fancy teas, price-wise.  The freshness and flavor are top-rank, though.
5;Excellent!;These are outstanding.  As one reviewer noted, they taste like Chips Ahoy!  They are expensive, but very good.
1;disappointed;These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack.
5;Wonderful taste;I got this particular oil to combat the damage from a H Pylori stomach infection, as well as get some good fats in me. First of all - this is an incredibly fresh GREAT TASTING product.
5;Cake decorating made easy!;The sugar bees came exactly as described and well packaged so NONE were broken when the arrived!  These were great for my son's 2nd birthday cake. He is crazy about Bee Movie and I couldn't bring myself to spend a load on a bday cake from the grocery store, so I bought these to help decorate the cake.
1;Not happy with this product;I have eaten pecans for many years and always enjoyed eating them. I ordered the Roasted Unsalted Pecans thinking it would have a nice flavor.
5;Outstanding product;Fast and easy, and great flavor.  About as close as you are getting without making them from scratch.
1;Nothing like Earl Grey except  for the smell;I bought some bulk Earl Grey tea from another Amazon supplier in the past (Frontier) that was rather pleasant. But this one was pure disappointment! It smelt good when you opened the bag but performed really poorly when you brewed it.
5;Just the way I remember it!;I lived in Hawaii as a kid and drank these everyday. They were my favorite and was so excited to see that I could now enjoy them in PA.
5;Yumm!;My husband's doc had put him on a pill form of red rice to help bring down his cholesterol. Then I read in a diet book about its low-carb appeal.
5;Best for freshness;If you are a twizzler lover you know the good and the bad.  The bad is that they will get jerky with time.
1;too stinky to have in the house;"My family insisted I throw these away, because they smelled so bad from such a distance.  I (somewhat reluctantly) did, and now we use another type that advertises itself as ""odor free"" and does seem to genuinely have a lot less smell than these."
5;Great taste, fast shipping!;Has a great taste, and just the right amount without devouring a huge bag! Received them very quickly. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a portion-controlled lean protein snack.
2;Not a healthy snack;I thought these would be healthy, but I was wrong. I tried one and it was so sweet it hurt my teeth (it has 14 gr of sugar for each small square).
5;The Best!;"I first remember Martinelli""s Apple Juice from the days when we used to use Martinelli's Sparkling apple juice as a non-alcoholic toast at Thanksgiving dinners. It was bright, fresh tasting and delicious."
5;Take a moment for yourself.;You wake up early on a sunday morning and you turn on your other side because you want to sleep a little more. But then you smell something like scrambled eggs, fried oignon rings and above all the strong scent of espresso.
4;Easily Broken;"These crackers taste great and I will continue to buy them through the ""Subscribe and Save"" program, but when they arrived, about 90% of the crackers were broken. Seriously - if I found more than ten whole ones in a box it was rare."
5;Excellent;the tea is very good with honey and I have seen a difference. I have lost 3lbs since taking it.
5;Great for a reduced caffine product;"I just want to say that this is a really good product.  I don't know why anyone would say that it tastes<br />like ""dishwater""."
3;Hmm...;Being a coffee snob, I saw this and thought it would be really good if it lived up to its description. I drink strong, dark, black coffee, and this stuff tasted just like regular coffee to me.
5;Diedrich K-Cups;The Diedrich K-Cups (Sumatra) were a great value, shipping was prompt and the coffee is delicious.  If you haven't tried Sumatra coffee.
5;Best dog food ever;I have an older dog who has a lot of health problems. He had skin allergies, hot spots, joint pains and other ailments.
5;Yum Yum;Upon receiving these, I was very surprised regarding such good packaging of the product, but upon eating it was amazed. This vegetarian product is one of the nicest I have had the pleasure to enjoy for quite a while.
1;YUCK;I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.
5;Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil - 8lb tub;You can tell this is superior to the processed coconut oil.  Big tub is great.
5;Intense, fresh flavor;I purchased another brand at a high end gourmet store at three times the price and it barely tasted like truffles. This oil is extremely intense and fresh in flavor.
5;I base entire meals around getting to use this honey mustard;This sauce is mild on the scale of hotness when it comes to condiments, but it is extremely flavorful.  I like it best on fried chicken.
3;Thought they were Hard Candy!;The gum taste pretty good while it lasts, appears to be endorsed by the American Dentist Association?  and they are sugar free!  Too fast on the trigger (one click shopping can be too easy sometimes) certainly not the best of the bunch. The gum looses flavor fast and what can a person do? 3 Stars for Extra Fruit Sensations.
5;Right amount of protien, quality product, affordable price;Our breeder introduced us to Diamond Adult Maintennance Chicken dog food.  She explained to us that we needed to make sure the protien levels in dog food are not too high as it could result in too fast a growth spurt in our 10 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback.
5;Fun & Easy;This product was very fun & easy to use. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it.
1;Nasty tasting splenda;Get that diet taste in a non diet soda..
5;highly recommended hot chocolate;They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more.
5;Love Black Silk - Hate this price!;Product:<br />I've become addicted to Folger's Black Silk coffee.  It is strong without being sharp, deep without being bitter, and extremely smooth.
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
3;organic chocolate milk;My kids love chocolate milk, and we only drink organic.  The aseptic cartons are great for packing in lunch boxes.
5;Great tea selection;Great mix of different teas. Seems good quality and especially for the low price.
5;THIS IS THE WAY HARD CANDY USED TO TASTE AND SHOULD;DELICIOUS, SIMPLE NATURAL INGREDIENTS CREATES A SIMPLY FANTASTIC TASTY, AND A BIT MORE HEALTHY OPTION FOR THE HARD-CANDY LOVER TO PUT IN THE DESKTOP JAR OR BOWL. I RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES HARD CANDIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT LIKE WERTHERS OR BUTTER-RUM, BUTTERSCOTCH.
3;Not the best taste;While this may have everything 100% natural in it I did not like the taste. This is naturally a personal preference.
5;YUMMY!;I have had the watermelon, mango, blue raspberry, and orange flavors of these gummi bears. They are delicious!  They are very flavorful.
5;PG tea purchase from Amazon;I love the richness of the PG black Tea..
5;Yum!;This stuff is great, I put it on rice, beans, eggs, chicken - you name it.  I have even added it to mayo for a sandwich spread.
5;Best Ginger Ale Ever!;Great flavor, real flavor, good price!Plus we like that it is in glass. The flavor of everything is better in glass.
4;Yummy chips;These are delicious.  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches, definitely more than a serving.
5;Cheddar POPCHIPS are totally Yummy!;I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.
5;Favorite!;Being around 200 calories for an entire large can you really cant beat this soup. My absolute favorite of the Progresso Light line of soups.
5;Love Them!;These treats are great. Our dog gets excited everytime he sees us reaching for them.
5;EXCELLENT Landjaeger!;This landjaeger is the REAL DEAL! I have actually been hunting in Germany (for boar, which was a blast and a TOTALLY different story), and, lo and behold, what did we eat in the field? LANDJAEGER! No lie. The product from Wisconsin made must be made by the cousin of the guy in Germany because it tastes exactly the same, and believe me, both were excellent.
5;Great Tasting goodness!;all 6 canisters got here on time. Sealed properly and very well packaged.
5;Kong Stuff'n Snacks;We have 2 dogs
4;Super-tasty noodles, but I can also taste the bowl;I want to love these because I love Nong Shim spicy noodles, and I'm lazy, so I'd rather heat up a bowl than wash a pan.  I make these the usual way: add very hot water, recover, let stand.
3;Beware the Menadione!  2 Flavors OK.  Call them.;"I agree with ""Nicole Rae"":  it makes no sense whatsoever that Weruva would be using Menadione Sodium Bisulfite. You don't need a Vit K supplement, and if you want it then use kelp pwdr because it's cheap."
5;another five star review;WOW.  so many salt and vinegar snacks disappoint.
5;Great food for baby;My love of Baby Mum-mum Rice Rusks does not account for where they are made or what they are made of. Rather, my love has to do with the fact that my daughter loves them and they do not make a mess.
5;"One bite and you'll become a ""chippoisseur""";I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip
5;Yummy gluten free!;This yummy little baked confection was truly delicious. Although, a little pricey.
5;No kitchen should be without Meat Magic!;I've used Meat Magic for years on all types of meat
5;Excellent if you know how to cook it! Great for Arroz con Pollo;I found these to be great if you know how to prepare them. First get a strainer and wash them with cold water, let the cold water run and run until must of the smell is gone.
5;SO IMPRESSED;I am on the east coast and was just introduced to these little pieces of heaven. I ordered Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon, when I got home from work, they were waiting for me! You can't beat that.
5;Childhood Favorite;These cookies are one of those childhood favorites that cannot help but please the palette.<br />They arrived in perfect condition and having these little 4 cookie packages is perfect for a sweet treat.
5;Delicious;"Last time I went to the store(Big Lots) I was just looking around for a moment and my mom spotted the Smart Fries, she knows that I am calorie conscious. She grabs the Smart Fries and tells me, ""look these have 80% less fat""."
5;Great Coffee;This is the BEST INSTANT COFFEE you can buy,it is the only instant coffee that has a strong robust flavor.<br />You can't beat the price!If you can find it in stores it sells for anywhere from $5.
5;Great tasting tea;I like Stash Tea because I find that it consistently delivers good quality and great tasting tea. The Fusion Green and and White Tea is not exception.
1;Not a good Amazon purchase...;Two of the six packages were beginning to mold, but not even close to the expiration date.  One other package was visibly torn.
5;Great salt easy to open and close bag.;I like this Celtic Ocean Sea Salt. The bag the salt comes in is easy to open and close over and over.
5;Best Stone-ground Mustard;This is a family favorite for both sandwiches/burgers, and cooking. Makes an excellent honey mustard as well.
5;Great Price;Great Price for the amount you got. Cheaper than any of the discount stores.
5;A yummy treat;We haven't built this gingerbread house yet, but the kit came with all the pieces securely packaged so everything is as fresh as can be.  There is gingerbread, icing and lots of candy for decorations.
2;Not Bad..;Found I probably dont like flavored coffee too much. The coffee flavor is a little too light and the cinnamon overpowers it.
5;27hockeymom67;I love the variety in this pack, especially that there is 2 of each flavor. My kids were drooling over some of the flavors, I had to fight them off.
3;Mediocre;This is OK. I had hoped for broccoli but instead I got broccoli flavoring.
5;Excellent sprinkled on Kale Chips and nuts;I baked up a batch of Kale Chips then sprinkled this Salt & Vinegar seasoning on them and it was addictive. A good balance between the salt and vinegar flavors.
1;Don't work :(;These do not work on calming down my hyperactive/neurotic pug.  He still paces the house and barks constantly.
2;Added surprise!;Received product timely.  Upon opening product found weevil infestation.
5;Finally!;When did Amazon start selling this stuff? It's so hard to find, and it's awesome. Seriously, awesome.
5;Yeah;I bought a sample of this product at a super market, but was unable to obtain this brand at any of my local stores.  I really like the taste and make my own drinks in the blender with ice, cappuccino mix and milk.
5;PERFECT BLEND;I found this blend about 4 years ago in Krogers.  I subsequently could not get it or find it in other grocery stores.
5;Great Flavour - Excellent Find!;"I've been hunting for snacks which taste good, but don't have BHA,BHT,EDTA,hydrogenated (partially or otherwise) fats, artificial colors and a myriad of other ingredients which are known to be ""bad"" yet they are still allowed in food production.  I can't express how excited I was to find these!  My husband is a very picky snacker - he loves these."
1;I'd rather eat cigaerette butts off of the street;These are the most VILE things I've ever tasted. Nothing like a mouth full of chemicals! Kashi tries to pass themselves off as a healthy company with only healthy products but some of their stuff should be recalled its so bad.
5;Yummy, yummy in my doggies tummies;I received my order of Mighty Dog Chicken, Egg & Bacon Dinner for my two dogs today.  The package came in perfect condition and shipped to me fast.
5;yum;My son loves these. Secretly I do too.
5;DELICIOUS;Okay if you like the flavor of coffee you have to get this. it is not strong but the flavor is dangerous enough to want to eat the entire batch of cupcakes or cake! must try.
5;I'm hooked!;These bars ROCK!  I've tried pecan,lemon,cherry pie, apple pie and choc. coconut and I love them all.
5;Great quality and price;We eat a lot of gummies in our house, so buying large bags like this are ideal. The alphabet gummies are large and taste as good as every other Haribo product.
5;"Find ""hard to Find"" tea";Stash Premium Chai Spice Black Tea can be hard to find on the local shelves, but is never more than a few clicks away on Amazon! The price is great and delivery is always as promised. Enjoy your tea from Amazon.
5;healthy dog treats;my dogs tell me that they are very good and good for their health..
1;Died, in spite of best efforts;I bought this from Amazon (not the seller depicted currently). The plant looked great on arrival, but it died with 15 days, despite trying very hard and following all instructions.
5;Best peach tea, ever!;I have tried so many peach teas that were either bitter, pale, or off tasting.  This is hands-down my favorite peach tea.
1;Not so good.;I consider myself a shortbread aficianado..
5;Kids love !;My daughter who does not like many cereal varieties loves this so much. She has a big bowl of mike and this cereal before going to school.
1;Made in China - NOT worth the risk;While these seems tasty and have a good texture, they are made in China. Despite what the manufacturer or anyone else says, while I might let my child play with a toy or wear clothes made in China, I would not let my child ingest any food made in China.
1;"This used to be a good product but the new ""recipe"" is really bad.";This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed.
5;The Yummy Bubbly Juice;The logo on The Switch says 100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't. The ingredients reads 100% juice (filtered) sparking water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon juice concentrates, natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) I'm on a health kick and I don't like to eat HFCS or corn syrup.
4;OK, not great;Tea is ok, not as good as we were expecting.  We had this tea at the local sushi bar and it was amazing, this was good but not as good.
5;Daughter asks for it every morning!;This is my daughter's absolute favorite breakfast food!  She is 3 years old, but has been enjoying it since about a year & half.  She also likes the Maple & Brown Sugar variety, but definitely prefers this one.
5;nestle-coffee mate packets;My guy likes these better than the can of loose powder. Sometimes the cans of powder clump up.
4;Great find!;These candies are very hard to find in the single flavor.  Good selection and even better price for this rare product.
5;Wow.;I love linketts. I'm a vegetarian.
2;Not as good as the ones packed in olive oil!;Maybe it's just that I almost always buy skinless and boneless sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil but I found these sardines packed in water to be really mushy and fishy tasting.  I love sardines but was very disappointed by the flavor and consistency of these sardines.
5;My New Tea;I bought this tea to try something new. It is lovely.
5;Good Start = Good Stuff!!;My daughter is now 5.5 months old and has been on this formula for 2.
5;HEALTHY, NUTRITIOUS TREATS!;My super picky dog LOVES these Free Range chicken-wrapped treats!  All the varieties are great
5;works great;I just reordered more of these traps. I originally bought them to catch the silverfish, spiders and crickets that had taken residence.
3;Beware of packaging in hot weather;The honey is great, however, the packaging was a sticky mess.  As far as I can tell, the hot weather caused the honey to expand and it leaked thru the packaging.
4;Stopped my leg cramps...;I've been drinking a bit of this mixed in water before bed, and my night leg cramps have stopped. 'nuff said.
5;waiting for the beef bouliion to be restocked;im on a saltfree diet  this is the best for flavor better than herb-ox. i tried to order the beef also but it hasnt come into stock yet.
3;Not as sweet as other French Vanilla coffees;I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.
5;Only way to get my son to drink milk;This was the only way we could get my son to drink milk. He loves it so much now that we sometimes are not worried if he does not eat well because we know he gets his nutrition from ovaltine.
5;doesn't taste like a protein bar;Among the various protein bars I've tried, Power Crunch and Oh Yeah! are the best.  For one thing, they don't taste like a protein bar, more like a regular candy bar.
5;love the coffee;Love the coffee and the best price. Arrived fast and reliabe.
2;not as good as Cafe Escapes;We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency.
5;Timothys Donut Shop;I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste.
3;delicious nuts;nice assortmet of nuts.fine quality.
5;Excellent and seriously healthy food- the cats love it;This is an exceptional quality cat food. Seriously healthy food.
2;there are much better gluten and dairy free cookies;My son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. The taste is okay.
5;husband savers;I order these every 2 years for my husband and he just loves them.  They come promptly and well-packed.
5;great product;Excellent addition to hotel's morning coffee service. Nice variety,great flavor and value.
4;good coffee;I found this coffee at Dollar General for $4.00 today.
5;Another winner from Golden Valley;This is delicious jerky. It's high in protein, softer and chewier than other brands, and it's relatively low in sodium for a jerky.
5;Great Brand;Everything I have bought from this brand was wonderful : tamari soy sauce, honey, applesauce without citric acid, water crackers, wheat bread, and something else..
4;Good graham crackers -- the kids like 'em;There's not a whole lot you can say about graham crackers. They're exactly what you expect, the same old slightly-sweet, crunchy crackers that we remember from when we were kids.
3;Delicious almonds but candy lacks flavor;These almonds were fresh and had a crisp and thin sugar coating but the sugar coating did not have a nice flavor.  I'm Italian and love the little flavor.
5;my favorite h2o;This water tastes great! Very refreshing and addictive. This is my go to refreshment.
5;great coffee;The coffee is very good. I am very happy with the product.
5;Amazin Bacon;Bacon jam is the best product since Peanut Butter!!!  A thin spread of this jam on the bread as you make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich will make you wonder why you never thought of this before and you won't want your sandwich any other way from now on.  This is real bacon cooked and chopped up for you.
4;licorice tea;Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.
5;Yum Yum;I received these cashews in a gift box from Costco.  I just opened this 2 oz bag and now they're gone.
5;Decadent In A Good Kind Of Way;When I opened the box the aroma of this coffee permeated the room in a wonderful way. I love the taste of this coffee.
5;Excellent Tea, Great Price;I drink Good Earth Decaf Chai and Vanilla Chai tea daily.  I was very happy to learn that Amazon sells it cheaper and offers an even better price when you sign up to have it delivered at specified times.
5;skeptical at first;I was sure skeptical at first, no carb no calorie noodles, sounded hard to believe.  My husband is diabetic so we are cutting out carbs and I gave these a try.
2;Jablum leaves me nonplused...;When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected.
2;Nice but a little weak;These are nice but I have to admit I love my coffee and I like it strong, I bought these because they said they were strong but they really aren't.  If you like a light to medium cup then you will like these.
5;The BEST Popchips Flavor Yet!;I haven't met a Popchips product I didn't like, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with these.  These are even more amazing than I imagined they would be.
5;Friskies Cat Food;The cat food arrived in perfect shape and on time. The price is cheaper than any store in my area so it's not only a convenience, but also a bargain.
5;So very yummy!;Wow! Since I have discovered my sensitivity to gluten, it's been difficult finding a quick breakfast bar to fit in with my busy life. However, after finding Kind bars, my confidence has been restored in gluten free food.
5;A Superior Product;A superior product at a good price.  I highly recommend this Stevia.
1;The title is miss-leading;We ordered three bottles. The title says 6.
5;Delicious ! Good Value !;I wholly recommend it.  I can eat one for a few days, with some crackers, Its really good stuff.
5;Num Num Num Num;These things are ridiculously good - and low carb!! Great way to get a chocolate fix. Surprisingly, one serving has fewer calories (150) than the plain Blue Diamond roasted almonds (170).
5;Very tasty cake mix;I ate a cake made from this mix on Christmas, and it tasted great! We all know that gluten-free can be hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit. The cake had a good texture, not dry at all.
1;ridiculous pricing scheme;1 cent for the root beer, and $47 for shipping.  Why does Amazon even let this on here?  It simply takes up space when I search for root beer.
5;A little goes a long way;It really DOES taste like movie theatre popcorn. And using the whirly popper, it takes only a few tablespoons to make a big bowl.
5;My cats beg for this;My cats love this because it has a lot of sauce. They like the regular Whiskas tender bites wet food also but end up licking off the sauce and leaving most of the food behind.
4;Weird but it works!;By weird I mean: here is a bottle that has this sugar replacement that cost a pretty penny and it measures in drops. Yes, two drops from this container equal one packet of splenda? And the container, supposedly, has 800 drops which is quite a statement that in true honesty I can not dispute because it would be really tedious to count every single little drop that pours out from the plastic dispenser.
5;Great product for cutting calories;I use Splenda every day to help reduce my sugar intake and limit calories in order to keep the weight off.  I actually prefer the taste of Splenda over normal sugar.
1;Recal effective 10/12/2012;[..
5;Best Chip Ever;This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had.  Look at the ingredients:  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper.
5;Simple ingredients and the crystallized ginger;Ooh so yum the combination of dark chocolate and crystallized ginger, real ginger prices that are tiny and leaves a nice little chew, no artificial bits.  Just as well it is only a 5 pack delivery!  First tried this from whole foods, and I was hooked.
5;Love boysenberries;I grew up in California where we always had boysenberries.  A pie made from them is my favorite.
4;This has won me over to a little peanut butter.;I didn't like peanut butter At All until I tried this(I love honey though), & wow it was pretty good! I use it also to make some awesome cookies & peanut butter bars. It is a little sweeter than regular peanut butter & doesn't stick to your mouth to much.
4;Yummy and Easy;I bought this today and made it when I got home, it was super easy and very good. The filling was thick and creamy and I did like the topping also.
1;completely ripped off;after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross.
5;Excellent service;I sent these roses as a gift for my cousin. Not only did they dispatch very quickly, but Sergio in Customer Services very patiently and proactively dealt with my confusion over whether the delivery address was my cousin's home or work, which affected when she would be available to receive the flowers.
1;DO NOT ues this formula, use Baby's Only;Please do the research before choosing a formula. When my daughter was first born I used Earth's Best.
5;Happy Hippos are GREAT!!!!;Seller was prompt with delivery.  Received in great condition in less than 7 days.
5;Favorite out of the Graduate meals;My twins both love this kind of the gerber graduates tubs. Everything in this one is very tender so it is a great one to start with.
5;Very nice!;I love this extract.  Good flavor, not too overpowering.
4;Has a sort of mild salty Captain Crunch cereal kind of taste...;..
5;Great Oatmeal;Ordered this for the first time in January, reordered two more cases of it today.  Very good oatmeal.
5;Get's ya bump n the moodo;It works. Give it about 20 mins and you're ready to begin your workout.
1;Nope. No. Nie...save your money and taste buds;I've really enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried from Waldens..
5;Delicious Natural Super-Chunky Peanut Butter;A nutritionist recommended this Teddie all-natural peanut butter to me. It doesn't have extra sugar and additives as many supermarket peanut butters have.
5;All she ever wants to eat;My little girl will ask for these crackers day and night.  Bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick.
5;Heavenly sweet;Great chocolate flavor with a delicate lightness.  Eating one of these bars is like eating a slightly crunchy honeycomb-like cloud encased in chocolate that melts in your mouth.
5;Good toy;We got one of these in large size for our Australian Cattle Dog mix, and he loves it.  We use it each night (sometimes in combo with other similar products) to feed him his dinner.
5;Question...;Is this the Snack Bar or the Meal Bar. Reviews are saying Snack.
5;I NEVER thought...;Call me old. I never thought the day would come when I would buy groceries online.
5;Texas tooth picks;My dogs thoroughly enjoy Texas Tooth picks and they also help to keep their teeth clean.  They are made from natural products and I like the packaging.
1;Sick Beagle on crunch and clean hartz;My dog was fine and I gave him a Hartz Crunch and clean as we were going to bed. I knew something was wrong when I noticed that my beagle, Cocoa, who rarely lets me out of site, did not follow me to bed.
5;great price for the quality;great price, quality was very good .Will buy again when need to get more beans to make my vanilla extract.
5;Dogs love 'em;Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.
5;This is the best seltzer;Vintage lemon-lime is the best seltzer ever, period.  The 1 liter bottles are best because once you open it it'll stay bubbly for about a day, and I rarely have one stay open more than a day without finishing is.
5;Best sunflower seeds...;I have ever tried!! Love love love them!<br />Not overly salted like other brands..
5;Yummy and Fresh;They have the best flavor and are so fresh. I order other flavors also with the same results.
2;Wasn't what I thought;The picture has peanut butter and I got strawberry which I am not a fan of, also they were smaller then the ones you normally get in the store. They were fresh for the most part.
5;The best there is;If you have ever spent the summer in Japan and had their green tea shaved ice this is what you had. They serve up shaved green tea ice in a big bowl and it is the cats meow.
4;Carame Cappuccino for Keurig;Nice price, fast shipping. A Keurig machine is not necessary to brew.
5;For those of us that don't like coffee;I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.
5;Great holiday gift;This product was not quite what I was expecting. It is just my own ignorance, but I assumed that smoked salmon would be lox or close to it.
4;Great Gluten Free Alternative;Using this Chebe mix for Pizza crusts, bread sticks, and dinner rolls are all very good bets. There is a host of other things you can make with it and if you have a look at [.
5;When I taste Lavazza, I am back in Italy!!;"After returning from Italy a few years ago, where my husband and I fell in love with the Lavazza espresso served in the cafes, we Googled ""Lavazza Crema e Gusto"" and found it on Amazon.  We have been ordering it ever since."
1;Made in China?!?!;Bought these at my local pet store not even thinking to look at where they're made (because everything in that place is usually super high quality stuff).  Came here to see what others think and that's when I saw the other reviews about being made in China - CAN NOT believe I bought these.
3;vitalife;did not know it was made in china, so i give small pieces to my yellow lab service dog. she likes them, was wondering why the price was low compared to other brands of jerky treats.
5;DELICIOUS!;I cant believe these are healthy..
5;My Cat Loves It!;My cat has always loved Organix Adullt cat food!  Yes, she gets moist food daily and she loves tuna.  She also has free choice of three different high quality dry cat foods, including Organix, each in a small bowl.
4;Smells Great....;Love, love, love!  The smell of the coffee packs!  When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over..
5;Mochamochamochamocha!;Now, when I was in college, I worked in the campus library. Said campus library also contained a coffee shop where I got an employee discount, so I lived on sugary coffee drinks.
5;My new favorite K-Cup!!!!!;This coffee rocks!! Not bitter and without that lingering aftertaste. I love the flavor of bold coffee and this one hits it perfectly.
4;Cold Winter Day Soup;This is one of those soups that is perfect for a cold, winter day.  It is very hearty and filling, and splitting one can between a couple of light-eaters makes it perfect.
5;Excellent Flavor;My sister, who is a coffee lover, told me about Tully's Italian.  Now, it's my favorite k-pod.
2;NOT long lasting;I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.
5;A great guilt-free snack.  Much better than chips;These SmartFries are so awsome!  With regular chips and bagged snacks you get maybe 10 - 15 per serving, but with SmartFries you get 65 per serving and only 110 calories.  I never even get close to that many though as I usually get my fix in around 20.
1;Great cup of coffee;I just purchased the Cuisinart cup o matic and just love it. I have been trying all different types of pods even though I can use regular ground coffee and the Senseo dark roast is our favorite.
5;Fantastic!;I make bread all the time & always look for variety..
5;nice vanilla beans;I have only bought the ones in the supermarket. Imagine my surprise when I got these beans.
5;Definitely will purchase from buyer in the future;Encountered 0 problems with this buyer. Received products as pictured/ordered in a timely manner.
2;Disappointing;This tea was not terrible, but lacked the distinctive malt flavor I associate with Scottish Breakfast Tea. I rank it well below, for example, Twinings English Breakfast and Earl Gray tea.
5;My terrific pasta;This Cavatappi is hard to find but what a lifesaver for the Amazon website and its sellers. Keep it coming.
5;Big bag, great price!;This bag will last me forever!! I only use a tiny scoop to mix with wet dog food. My dog doesnt seem to like to eat this dry, but she may just not like dry dog food.
4;BEST POP-TART EVER MADE;THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST POP-TARTS EVER MADE!!  NO, THEY DON'T EXACTLY TASTE LIKE ICE CREAM.  I WOULD SAY THEY ARE BETTER THAN ICE CREAM.
5;My Latest Addiction...;First let me say that as a general rule, I HATE anything flavored with aniseed.  But these little treats have caused me to change my tune.
5;Only dog food I will use;After reading horrible reviews about dog food and with the onset of my puppy having seizures, I made him only home cooked meals specifically for dogs.  He was having stomach problems and went through many different recipes always consulting with my Vet, but then I found Halo dog food.
2;Poor Quality;I was very disappointed how the shipped the products
2;Annoyingly Awkward;My cats generally love all toys made by Fat Cat.  I don't know if it's the catnip within or the vast array of colors, shapes, sizes and crinkly noises that attracts them.
3;Ajinomoto is a MSG company, what did you expect.;Here's a nice link to name almost all the things that contain MSG.<br />[.
5;COLMAN  MUSTARD;I love this mustard and was unable to find it in my area. I found it here, on Amazon, ordered and it arrived in no time ! ! ! It ain't cheap, but boy is it good.
5;Great dog food!;I have a dog who has sensitive skin.  This food is easy to mix and she loves to eat it.
5;Tastes nearly as good as the full calorie to me;At just 100 calaries , these Splenda sweetend little starbucks coffees are just wonderful . I'm doing everything in my power to lose about twenty pounds .
5;excellent;Wow!!!  This cat food must have something like catnip in it.  After the first smell and taste, the cats have come at the first sound of opening another can.
4;What I expected...;I like Special K cereal. So when I saw these small (single serving) boxes available I jumped on it.
5;Lady fingers;Great to use for making certain type of cakes or just for eating with ice cream or a cup of tea or coffee. Very tasty and low in calories.
2;Bitter, Strange, Unpopular;We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting.
5;Great product;Thanks for making this great product.  I was looking forward to<br />Using the handy chunks, but unfortunately my grandson left it by<br />The front door because I wasn't home.
5;Great Tea;The tea tastes great and lasts a long time with 120 bags. I couldn't even find a value like this at wal-mart.
4;Very good sardines;These sardines are flavorful with a pleasing tomato sauce, but they should be with all of the salt. Plus, there's too much saturated fat to make these a regular staple.
5;LOVE this product!;I absolutely love this cereal.  Smells soooo good!  Almost has a banana-y smell to it in my opinion.
2;"Eh... not bad, not good, just ""meh"".";Sweet and simple.<br /><br />Ingredients wise, it's a 4.
2;item okay but poor packaging;***<br /><br />this 5 pounds of citric acid was ordered 6-20-11, arrived 6-27-11. order was fulfilled by amazon and sent in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box with no additional padding to protect it in transit.
5;Lemon Myrtle;"""It takes over 2,000 picks by hand to create 2.2 pounds of tea."
4;Great product!;This is a wonderful chew bone. My dog (vizsla) chews on one of these and it usually lasts her a couple months (shes not an intensive chewer).
4;Great cookies!;I absolutely love these cookies. I bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite I fell in love.
5;Great popcorn;This is great popcorn!  No extras needed. Just dump it all in and let the popper do the rest.
5;Good for what it is;I tried the Gloria Jean's cappuccino and was disappointed.  It was not bad, it just didnt taste like  or have the texture of cappuccino.
5;Crunchy Tasty Light Snack!;Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom-Raspberry snack from his 12-pack box. The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.
5;Bahlsen Dark Chocolate Cookies -  A Treat;I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores..
5;Best coffee maker, nothing really compares;My mom bought me this coffee maker for my birthday and I am in love with it.  Granted, this the first and only Keurig coffee maker I have had, it does everything it should.
5;protein bar;The think thin dark chocolate bar is a low sugar, high protein, meal replacement bar and is also a great snack..
5;Delicious!;These cookies are delicious!  They freeze well and are especially good warmed in the microwave for a few seconds.  I eat these mainly for breakfast but are great as in between meal snacks too.
5;Favorite snack chip;Tried these the first time a few months ago, and I was hooked! I have purchased two cases within the last 2 months, and shared them with my family. The last case I just bought is gone, and I am ready to buy another case.
5;The best;Everything in the sampler is excellent!  Not surprising since everything we have ordered from Nueske's is the absolute finest in taste and quality.  I highly recommend this product.
5;Delicious;Enjoy the taste, milk free product. Ilike milk in hot cocoa, just can't see adding powdered milk.
5;Amazing is right!;This bread mix definitly lives up to it's name.  It is really easy to make in a bread machine, oven or even as dinner rolls.
5;Great oil;This is a great oil that comes in a bottle that keeps it safe from light. I use this oil for all my frying needs and it has never let me down, even in these harsh economic times.
5;Best curry powder available anywhere;This is a mild curry with surprisingly strong flavor. I have used it for years, but ran out a while back and had trouble finding it so was forced to used other curries.
5;Always Good;I have ordered this multiple times. Peanut Butter is a favorite of mine, however it is not friendly to my nutrition plan.
5;Tastes WONDERFUL!;"My baby loves these and I have actually gotten my 3yo and 5 1/2 yo to eat these as well. They are so nice I just open and give them the pouch and they ""drink"" it."
4;This was a hit and miss;One pack was Heavenly,the next was disturbing.We have yet to try the third one.
1;I'd rather be served a plate of garbage from the dumpster.;I am a HUGE fan of Suddenly Salad Classic.  In fact, I probably make it 2-3 times a week.
1;Tastes like sweaty gym socks;I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was).
5;Made for a Happy Valentines;I went through a few of these types of boxes and came across a lot of bad reviews but I stuck with this one and it did not disappoint.  I'm privileged to be in love with a die hard candy fanatic and he has been eating on this box for 4 days now, quite happily.
2;Not the best;As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is.
4;Tastes like water!;I was a little leary trying this high-alkaline water but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes like normal tap water to me.
3;Great Flavor but Bottle Top Hassle;I used it in a Moqueca which is a Brazilian Fish Stew, and it was very delicious. The problem I had was with the bottle top.
5;Great food;My cat started throwing up while I was on a business trip. I used amazon prime to overnight this to the friend that was taking care of her.
5;SOFT FUR COAT;I am so glad I found this product on amazon after research! I noticed my kitten was not immediately drawn to it so I added some moist food to the top. The kitten's fur is short hair but so soft and has a nice shine ! This is the only place I can find it and it is a good price with subscribe and save.
5;Decaf Chai spiced loose tea;This is the only brand which I could find that sells decaf chai as loose leaf tea.  It is delicious also.
5;Great Product;We love this product.  It's a smooth and flavorful Cappuccino.
3;Tastes ok but don't like how it's made.;While I don't mind the taste of Splenda, it is one of the better no calorie sweeteners for not giving you that horrible after taste, I do not like the way it is made. If you want to know how it's made, just do an internet search and find out what chemical is used in making this sweetener and the fact that it doesn't get broken down by your body and ends up in the water.
5;Quinoa Linguine;We are very pleased with this product and your price and delivery. This is not easy to find in grocery stores and is a high health product that is made in many forms.
4;Good Coffee, Different Packaging;I love discovering and drinking a variety of different coffee's in the never ending quest for the perfect cup.  The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.
5;Great quality!;I am a huge fan of Navitas brand products.  The quality of the Cacao is top notch and will be the brand I get from here on out.
5;Yummy;Very tasty and the texture is good.  The only downside is that you end up eating too many of them at one sitting.
5;great;I got this for free as a sampler when I purchased a box of 24 popchips when they were on sale for the amazon's gold box deal of the day. The chocolate on the bottom of the car was a bit melted but that's understandable given that it's 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit here, so unless they put ice packs inside the box it would arrive in a melted condition, adding ice wouldn't make it worth it to sell.
5;My dogs have rated Booda Bones 5 Stars!;I have three King Charles Cavalier Spaniels and they are picky, picky eaters even when it comes to Treats.  They love the peanut flavored Booda Bones and have one every day.
5;Love them.;I'm hooked.  Bought this last month and devoured them.
5;a real treat;i have been gluten free for 6 months now and have really missed treats like cinnamon buns..
5;Delicious;"""Tex-Mex remoulade"" is the best way to describe this delicious sauce. You can use it as a taco sauce, but it also makes a great spread for a sandwich or wrap, or a condiment for fish or meat."
5;Smooth, substantial, with chewy flavor!;I love English Breakfast tea, and this was not a disappointment. With some cream and sweetener, this made the perfect cup to get me going in the morning.
3;Kind;"""Kind Healthy Grains"""
5;gummiebears;Quick delivery and I am loving the gummie bears..
4;Pretty Darn Good;For those who need some darn good chili fast, here's the answer. This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef.
2;kind of small;A little disappointed to see how small the strawberries were. It would have been better that the produce is not infused with syrup.
3;Possibly Stale Beans?;I have purchased this brand of Lavazza, as well as the Tierra and Gran Riserva.  I use them in my Alex Duetto Espresso Machine (which I couldn't recommend more).
5;Authentic Costa Rica sauce;We first leaned of this after being in Costa Rica, where it is served with every meal.  Soooo good!  Excellent on omelets and also a dish we call Costa Rica Chicken, make some rice and black beans, saut&eacute
5;Pataks Lime Relish;This is, in my opinion, the best Lime Pickle, or Relish out there.  It has a unique tangy flavor and really adds to any curries I make.
4;Excellent grain-free option for your pet;"Taste of the Wild is a quality, affordable grain-free option for your cat. Felines have very little, if any, biological need for grains so it would make sense to avoid ""supermarket brands"" that are nothing more than the animal equivalent of junk food."
5;Great Nutrition, Highly Recommend;I have been eating the Kashi Heart to Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal for a few years now.  I first began eating it after being diagnosed with an Underactive Thyroid.
3;sweet and pulpy;The tea tastes very good - it has a nice flavor and is refreshing.  It's a bit sweeter than I would like, but people who like sweet tea will like this tea.
5;This stuff is good.;I bought this teas as an alternative to plain iced tea. Drop a single bag into a gallon jug of warm water and in about 30 minutes you have a oitcher of very flavorful and refreshing tea.
5;Great taste!  You won't be disappointed!;Tastes wonderful.  So many options.
5;Black Pearls;I was introduced to Taj Mahal by an Indian women who used it as the base for a wonderfully flavored chai using mostly ginger and cardamom.  I have been a fan ever since.
5;Outstanding coffee;We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure.
5;My favorite tea;I drink a variety of black, green, and herbal teas. This is my favorite flavor.
4;younger dogs love them;My two younger, three year old dogs absolutely love these and it is much easier to get them to take than the pills. My eight year old however, can't chew them because they are hard on his teeth.
2;Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE;Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.
5;Pleasantly surprised...;They're huge!  You definetely get what you pay for.  Love the taste.
5;Xylitol tastes good. Erythritol doesn't.;Yeah, don't feed it to dogs. Ok, since I'm human and I don't own dogs and if I did I wouldn't be feeding them sweetened things anyway because dogs are carnivorous, I am very happy with this product.
5;Closet To the Real Thing;Just wanted to say that this bread in taste and texture is closet in taste and texture with real bread. I use it to make grilled cheese, frenche toast and in lots of other sandwiches and it tastes great.
5;Delicious coffee!;We love this coffee. We just get more out of the freezer as needed.
5;Excellent Product!;This is a very good product if you are interested in lingonberries. Lingonberries are good for you.
5;This is the only K Cup we buy!;As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.
5;My New Favorite Shampoo;I received & reviewed the dandruff formula version of this shampoo prior to using this. I loved it and got great results
5;I love Hills!;My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.
5;Great Product;I've been using this product for several months, and it works very well. Since I only use half the recommended dose, I use half the amount of hot water recommended to dissolve it.
5;Tastes Great;I love these almonds.  Good mix of sweet and salty.
3;Popchips 5 Stars, Chili Lime Flavor 3 Stars;I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips.
1;Mis-boxed Item;"I COULD rate this item but ""Mild"" wasn't what I received.  The sealed box that said ""Mild"" on the outside actually contained ""Wild"" packets."
1;Italian dressing;This Teriyaki sauce is great Italian dressing, but terrible Teriyaki sauce. If you are looking for a gluten free version of Teriyaki sauce, look elsewhere, because whatever this is, it isn't Teriyaki.
4;Good, clean cocoa powder;"I think they call it ""cacao"" as opposed to ""cocoa"" when it's less processed and more pure or something.."
5;Great for small dogs with allergies and stomach problems...;My pug loves Grandma Lucy's Organic Pumpkin treats.  Pumpkin is an excellent source of fiber and is also helpful for dogs when stomach issues (trouble going to the bathroom) arise.
3;It's soooo weird!  Doesn't dispense well.;Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container.
5;Organic White Tea with Mint;This is one of my favorites and I have ordered it many times.  I enjoy the mint flavor and appreciate the fact that it is organic.
5;Great for Earl Grey lovers!;I first ran across the Double Bergamot by accident.  I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.
1;all but 4 were broke;i am very disappointed i just paid 20$ for a bunch of  old broken bubble gum. the box is fine there is no signs of it being dropped or torn in to but for some reason all the gum is damaged.
4;Shipping month important!;Be wary of when you order these candies as they do not keep well in the heat.  I found when amazon sent the gummies packed in a box within a box they made it fine.
5;great price;The price for these K-Cups is great. They are so costly in the store, so this is a great way to buy in bulk.
5;Really great Coffee;We just got back from an extended vacation in Italy and fell in love with Espresso shots and the 2 brands Esssey and Illy-Both wonderful and couldn't go back to the Starbucks beans we were using at home.  We have an Espresso machine and ground the beans each morning.
4;Delicious!;BBQ Pop Chips are a delicious tasting healthier chip than many on the market.  They are light and full of flavor.
5;lodi gayle;I LOVE THIS TEA.  I WISH STASH STILL HAD THIS IN TEA BAGS.
5;NO BETTER SNACK!;My son and I are converts. No more of the snacks, hot fires,  potato clips, etc.
5;It's great!;I have tried many K cups and some are hits and others are just plain misses. This one is a HIT! I don't like strong, bitter tasting coffee.
5;pretzel pieces snack;"Love this snack!  <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;My New Afternoon Snack;Very filling and tastes good.  Like the other reviewers, I'll note that you want to drink it ice cold.
4;Great Nutrition!;My dog is 1 year 7 months old. She has had minor digestive issues when changing food in the past.
5;Grow herbs, flowers & fruit in the worst environment;This device waters your plants and turns the lights on and off based on the setting.  Add the nutrient plan and you have some of the fastest growing plants out there.
5;Traverse Bay Cherries;We are very pleased with this purchase. The cherries are great! We have since sent boxes to family members.
5;The Sweet Life;Baking for my husband (with type 2 diabetes) just go easier.<br />I can adapt regular receipes.
4;Inexpensive La Llave at Walmart;We have been buying Cafe La Llave Espresso in a 12 oz can at Walmart and have been perfectly happy with this coffee. It intrigues us that this Cuban coffee can be purchased in the US with a trade embargo in place.
5;This stuff is great!!;This tea not only  aids in digestion, but this tea also has a calming affect..
5;Great taste and good for you!;I purchased this item for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veg servings a day.
2;Way too sweet.;Loved the filling but the frosting is WAY too much.  It made the whole thing too unbearably sweet.
5;good price;Torani Syrup, Sugar-Free Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3) Best price anywhere.
5;Love it!;I'm not a big cereal eater, but I love this cereal.  It is perfect with Vanilla Coconut milk.
5;Spice Lab Himalayan Salt;
5;Great Option For Diabetic Cats!;My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year
5;Just perfect!;Gte em if you can..
1;Made in China;Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.
5;Perfect Product...just too expensive.;This works perfect if space is limited.  I actually bought two because if you're like me, 30 kcups close by just isn't enough.
5;"Ignore the first ""review"".";This is Cinnamon Toast Crunch with frosting on it. Of course it is gonna be sugary, most likely diabetic coma inducing with only one spoon full.
1;Are they kidding with the price?;Either I'm missing something and this is a double pack, which the description does not seem to support, or these people are insane.  There are loads of places to get this same product for $3.
5;Best Dark Chocolate!;I LOVE this dark chocolate, its really dark, and really good. I can't get enough of it.
3;good idea;Its  a great idea and works as intended, unfortunetly even a small bit gives one of my dogs really bad runs. YIKES.
4;liked them;I like this product. Sort of a generic mexican taste but very edible.
5;Best Coffee Ever;This is the best Decaf Coffee on the market.  I have always enjoyed coffee but because of health issues I have been restricted to decaf.
5;I'd give this food 10 stars if I could;I adopted a prison program dog Nov 22, 2006.  She is a Lab/Poodle mix.
5;Senseo Coffee Pods;I love shopping Amazon for my Senseo coffee pods.  You always have a great selection, the price is right, and it is delivered to my door!!  This was the first time I tried the Kona coffee and it is delicious.
5;Fantastic flavor and fragrance and great for bagging bears too!;This dark sesame oil does wonders for any application that calls for sesame oil. Keep it in the fridge for longevity so it doesnt go rancid on you and you will be very happy with its performance.
5;It makes the BEST Margritas;I watched Bobby Flay on the Food Network Channel make some Margritas using Prikly Pear Syrup.  So I did a Google search and I found Cheri's.
3;"Should be called ""Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts""";"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list."
1;Save Your Money;I received this as a gift and made them as soon as they came in the mail. Like one reviewer says, they taste terrible.
3;pretty good tasting, doesn't cook well in my microwave;I like the flavor of this popcorn. It's a little on the salty side, but just right with the butter and pepper flavor.
5;My favorite!;Out of all the British teas I've tried, my favorite (and my family's) is Typhoo.  When my friend tried it, she thought it was some high end British tea, so when I told her what it was she couldn't believe it.
3;Coconut Oil for your skin;This product is extremely oily but does soak into the skin after a few minutes.  The fragrance is nice but I don't believe I would buy it again.
4;Yummy!;I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.
3;A Mixed Bag;Some of the early reviews for this entree are pretty harsh.  I figured it couldn't be THAT bad so I bought a bunch at the blow out price.
5;My favorite chocolate for baking;Ghirardelli chocolate is the best when compared to others on the market. I will always buy it as it does give a good taste of chocolate in cookies or cake.
2;NIce presentation but label takes away from the appearance;I am disappointed with this purchase and I am keeping it for myself because I am too ashamed to give it to my mom. I thought this would be a great birthday present.
5;Best BBQ sauce;This bbq sauce is the best I have ever purchased. It comes highly recommended.
5;Possibly the best soup out of a can I have ever had;Note that amy's products always needs salt. I nuked it for 3 minutes, sprinkled with kosher salt and doused it with 10 jiggers of Yucatan hot sauce.
5;Delicious and healthy snack!;If you want something different and healthier, and enjoy the flavors of nori and other seafoods, give these a try! The spice is a bit hotter than I thought but the flavor of the nori still shines through. They are light and crispy and could be your new favorite snack.
5;One of the best products I have used (in tandem with neem oil);I don't like to use unnecessary chemicals around the house or yard and have been struggling with mold, fungus and insects in my flower garden.  This product is safe for the environment and still does the job.
3;Kind of an odd flavor!;I love the Sweet Leaf stevia, but the Vanilla Creme isn't one of my favorites. It's an odd flavor and doesn't taste very vanilla-y to me.
5;YUMMY!!!!;I am a self-proclaimed carb addict. I love bread, bagels, french fries, and absolutely anything with a noodle in it.
3;Bad batch of Stevia;Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary.
5;Its a hit in our home!;I generally have picky eaters in this house.  They all typically eat the same things daily for breakfast.
4;Love the taste but...;I love Glutino crackers they taste so good even my non-gluten free spouse likes them. But, another approach to packaging is needed so there are not so many broken crackers in every box.
1;All Ginger, No Lemon = Nasty Taste;I was really looking forward to trying this, but it tasted like a bunch of raw ginger put through a juicer & heated up (and I followed the preparation instructions). I coudn't taste any lemon at all.
4;Tasty Chai tea;I was skeptical thinking this tea might not have a bold enough flavor.  It is instead very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.
5;Great treat;I have two rescue Beagles and they get one Greenie per day.  Geat treat and they love them.
1;Barely edible;One word, yuk. OK, based on the 20 word minimum
5;Great for ice coffee;During the summer I like to add lots of ice to my coffee and make it cold. However adding lots of ice will tend to dilute the coffee and make it bland.
5;Fantastic and Versatile;This baking mix is amazing.  Great flavor and many recipes to choose from - both on the package and the website.
5;The good type of sour blue raspberry candy.;The sour blue raspberry bottles sold by Candy Depot are NOT the knockoffs from Mexico with the weird aftertaste and granulated sugar. They are the original soft blue bottles with a sugar coating that is almost dusty.
1;Bad taste and burn;I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.
4;Beggin' Strips, Bacon Flavor Dog snacks;"Our sheltie ""Pepper"" loves these snacks and Amazon has the best price.  Ordering them on line is a great time saver plus we do not live close to a large city."
5;Yummy, hint of peach is lovely.;I love this tea! It has just the right amount of peach so that it does not overpower the oolong. I can't find this in any of my local grocery stores.
5;Yum!;Prior to finding this on Amazon (why didn't I look here first?), I could only find this in one local gas station (which is out of the way mind you). Nowhere else.
5;saved my Keurig;I was so disappointed when I tried my new Keurig.  The coffee was weak and some of it tasted like bad diner coffee.
5;Yummy!!!;My name is Duncan, and I'm a mommy's boy, and she and Dad love me so much that they give me one of these every day after supper.  They taste great and clean my teeth at the same time.
5;Best Snack for Celiac Son!;This is actually tasty! My son will only eat this brand and the peanut butter flavor. We tried the other flavors and for us they were terrible.
2;Another Brand is Better;There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.
5;My dog loves this!;As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy.
5;Good product;I recently read that coconut oil can be helpful with dementia so I looked for an easy source (as a hopeful preventative!).  This is a very nice product and gives good instructions for using it for cooking and also as a hair treatment.
5;Great taste when cold brewed!;I have been drinking this tea for months now along with the Tazo Zen green tea. I love both flavors and have found that they make a wonderful iced tea (the only way I like to drink tea).
5;Strawberry Matcha Forever!;Mmmm strawberries. I cannot begin to tell you how much of my life has been spent picking strawberries.
5;Arguably but not defintively Better than Greenies;My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows.
4;My Cats Liked it For a While;I have two older cats (10+ years) and one had been throwing up every day which was very worrisome.  I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.
5;A great instant cup of hot cocoa;One of the joys of having a Keurig K-cup machine is that you can make a cup of what anybody wants at anytime (providing that you have it of course).  Dark coffee, decaf, flavored coffee, green tea, English tea, herbal tea, etc.
3;Tastes more like Carbonated apple juice;The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.
5;Great Coffee Substitute;Coffee was killing my stomach so I went in search of a healthy organic alternative to my morning ritual and discovered this little treasure.  The jasmine is strong and the green tea is superb.
3;Good Tea;Tea was very good with a mild hint of mango.  Rather expensive compared to other brands.
5;A kid favorite;I was SO happy when I was able to buy this drink on Amazon.  No store or club around me carries it, and I don't like the idea of paying over $1.
5;Oh Snap!  Crackle!  Pop!;OMG!  I have found sugar-covered gold again!  I used to order these from Hometown Favorites and then they had a few issues with security.  But now, I can feast upon the cereal of my childhood joy.
5;Hands down, my favorite;We have had our Kourig coffee maker for several years now. My wife likes to try different flavors (right now German Chocolate is her choice) and I will occasionally have a cup of decaf at night.
5;Yummy, and good for me, too!;My doctor has me monitoring my blood sugar level, so when I saw this was supposed to have a low impact on blood sugars, I thought I'd try them.  To my surprise, I enjoyed them and they worked as advertised!  I hope everyone else who enjoys them has the same guilt-free experience.
5;HEALTHY AND DELICIOUS;THIS ITEM IS GREAT.  100% FRUIT AND STILL GREAT TASTING.
5;The Wonder of the Bun;Bread is one of the world's oldest prepared foods, dating back to the Neolithic era.  Wonder Hot Dog Buns, 12 oz is modernity's take on this most ancient of foods.
5;Dogs love Yummy Chummies;I use these for treats when training my performance obedience dogs. All three dogs love, love, love these treats.
5;organic pasta;if you never ate organic whole grain pasta, you are missing something special. not only tasty, but very good for your health too.
5;Excellant product - good price;Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.
5;LOVE;I have been using this stuff for years. I recently moved to Los Angeles and can't find it out there please get it in Ralphs or Albertsons.
5;Don't buy it used;"Its a great product, and our dog loves them.  But I see that Amazon lists some sellers of ""used and new""."
5;My snobby hound loves these;My beagle/lab mix is fairly picky with treats, but she goes nuts for these. I've been trying to find something other than chicken jerky from China (after reading reports from the FDA showing illness/death in dogs) that my dog really loves, and these seem to fit the bill nicely.
5;great snack for training and rewarding;i have a 3 month old jack russell terrier and at first he did not really like the treats but after a few days he slowly began to eat it. now, it seems like he eats these treats just as much as his kibble.
5;Alpine Spiced Cider Sugar-Free Drink Mix;My daughter introduced me to this delicious drink mix that helps satisfy sweet and yummy flavors when trying to lose weight. I put one package in a slim thermos with hot water and it lasts for hours.
5;Pups Delight;I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective.
5;Helps you increase metabolism;I drink this at once a day and I have noticed a drastic increase in my metabolism.  I love the taste of this tea.
5;Nature's Path Blueberry cereal;This cereal is crunchy, tasty and loaded with protein and fiber.  It is great with milk, yogurt or by itself.
5;Tastes Good;This helped me heal a stomach ulcer and gives me more energy. The taste is sweet and delicious and I have to laugh at the reviewers who don't like the taste because they've obviously never tried wheat grass juice that was bitter.
5;Easy to carry for endurance events;Bought these for cheap on amazon.  Easy to carry for long distance canoe racing events.
5;Nothing Compares;This oil is wonderful, I have nothing but good things to say about it.<br /><br />Taste is fresh.
5;Great value and product;We are VERY please with this product. My daughter is getting married and having a candy bar at the wedding.
1;Very disapointing!!;I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels.
4;Great for making Tofu;This is the product to get for making Tofu.  We are so happy that it is easily available from Home Naturals through Amazon.
5;BEST VANILLA WAFERS EVER!!!!;I have been using Jackson's Vanilla Wafers for years. However, because I can't seem to find them locally, my relatives bring me back quite a few bags when they go south.
4;Good tea;My husband seems to love this tea.  I, on the other hand, I'm unable to develop a taste to it.
2;It's okay but...;I have a Labrador who is a strong chewer and I warned the lady at the store that he is smart with treat dispensing toys - I was really interested in the one pictured on the back that screws together for him and she convinced me he'd never get the middle treat out. Two minutes and it was out, four minutes and it was gone.
4;Incredibly Delicious Aroma...;..
5;Cats love it!;I have two cats who literally love these pouches!!  My cats have gotten into the habit of getting a pouch (between the two of them) in the morning for breakfast and one pouch between the two in the evening when I come home from work. On the weekends when I don't work and want to sleep in.
5;Had to find a way....;I have started having reactions to some of the canned food that I buy.  I do not know if it is the product or the cans but I wanted to make my own and find a way to freeze some of those products.
5;Simply Awesome...;I was sceptical of the taste and texture of hemp before I bought it, but when mixed with raw milk, I love it! It has a gritty texture along with a mild and nutty flavor that is not too sweet and does NOT taste artificial like many whey proteins that are highly proceeded. This is done for the sake of the brainwashed consumer who thinks they need sugar (or fake sweeteners) to feel good.
5;Good Food;Delivered quickly. Comparable price to PetSmart - and I don't have to lug it home myself.
2;Really;Received cappuccino K cups from Grove Square, they were in a mailer box not even in the original box , I was unable to see nutrional value of any of the three types of coffee , it is super sweet, I am very disappointed and am stuck with $45.00 of K-cups.
3;sold out;this used to be an awesomely organic solution to healthy petfood with no fillers..
4;Great product;By first soaking tapioca in 4 times as much room temperature water as tapioca (overnight for the large pearls and a couple hours for the small ones), then draining off the water and proceeding with your recipe you get tender tapioca in a reasonable amount of cooking time.  Using a lower temperature will eliminate or minimize the problem of the pearls breaking apart.
5;Spicy and yummy;This tea is awesome!  My favorite way to have this tea is steeped with fresh mint from the garden.  It has a strong cinnamon and spicy taste, which I love.
5;Amazing!;The Bold Habanero BBQ flavor is amazing!!!  Plain almonds are very tasteless and hard to eat.  However, they are such a powerful and healthy food, I work them into my diet several days a week.
5;My, this is popular with the cats!;"""Uh oh,"" I thought when I saw ""Product of Thailand"" on the box, with the recent contaminated Chinese wheat gluten scandal reverberating in my memory, however unfairly. (I'm wary of food imports from Third World countries in general now."
4;Excellent Tomatoes - Bad Shipping;Bionaturae Organic Tomatoes are excellent. The problem was not with the tomatoes however, but the shipping.
5;One of the Greatest Sauces Known to Man;I won't say it's the absolute best hot sauce, but if you're serious about hot sauces, and you haven't tried Sriracha, you need to add this sauce to your collection now.  What I like most about this sauce is it tastes like my homemade sauce.
5;Lovely Green Tea;I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.
5;Stronger than Lipton;I bought this tea for my husband and he loves it. We make tea by the pitcher and with Lipton we needed 4 bags but with Twinings we only use 3 so it's more economical with a better flavor.
1;Not all its cracked up to be.;The peanut butter was too bland even for my daughter. Added things like cinnamon and splenda to make it taste better.
5;Sweet-mate was a sweet deal;Not sure if I'm lucky or it was just a fluke with everyone else. But I've bought this brand for a dollar at my local dollar store and it tastes almost identical to equal.
5;Best Flavor - Super Convenient;Of all the K-Cup flavors we've brewed, this is the best.  It is so good that we have actually subscribed (15% discount!) to receive these boxes every couple months.
3;I wasn't that impressed;The taste was okay.  The cookie is thin and light and crispy.
5;Great herbal tea for cramps;"My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup."
5;Yummy!;I've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their Keurig K-cup brewers.  The search is over!  This Grove Square Hot Cocoa received four big smiles from my sons.
3;you are getting screwed;The pasta is ok, although it doesn't have the same texture as Barilla for example, but NOTICE THE WEIGHT.  IT IS 13.
5;Best black licorice ever!;This is REAL licorice, with a strong, robust flavor and great texture that best matches a treat I used to enjoy as a kid.<br />This isn't a licorice for Twizzler lovers.
5;Wonderful flavor;My family loves taco nights, but we don't make them often enough to justify buying bottles of seasoning that won't get used within a year so I use packaged seasoning mixes for them.<br />This one is hands down the best we've ever tried.
5;Yummy and easy to use;I love this Hazelnut coffee.  The flavor is smooth and has just the right amount of hazelnut in it.
5;A Yankee's take on a British staple;Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising.
5;Halloween candy;Got this candy for Halloween.  I live in a neighborhood where children stream uninterrupted for over 3 hours.
5;Stevia Extract;"I have used the ""Now""brand stevia for several years now but this improved version is just as good and it dissolves in liquids much easier than the old product. I use this as a sweetner in any drink that needs sugar."
5;little bit of everything;I love these cookies. They have a little bit of everything and are so good.
5;IF YOU LIKE CAMOMILE YOU'LL LOVE THIS;THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF THE TAZO TEAS. IT HAS CAMOMILE IN IT PLUS ALOT OF OTHER FLAVORS WITH THE SAME TYPE OF TASTE.
5;Love it;I grew up on this syrup and don't like maple so I love this syrup<br />I have tried other cane syrups but this is the BEST.  I sent some to my daughter<br />who by the way won't eat any other kind either and she was sooooo happy.
5;Phenomenal Flavor!!!;This is the best tasting hot sauce I've ever had..
5;Gotta Have it!;I like buying this package, keeps me from running out. I wish Keurig made a maker that would fill a cup.
5;Super Excellent!;This is great!  A rich buttery rum flavor with just the right amount of spices.  The coffee, itself, is very smooth and full-bodied.
5;flax seed good for your insides :);we add it to our daily morning smoothies. No taste but the benefit is there.
4;Galivanting in the Dutch East Indies in the Name of the Queen...;The scent of freshly steeped Superfruit White Mangosteen with Peach tea..
5;Great!;I recently started looking for a more natural way to boost my energy at the end of the day before hitting the gym. I used to use no-xplode and jack3d, and although I don't get that energy rush I did with those supplements, I definitely get through my workouts with the constant energy this gives me (no jitters, side effects either).
4;Fast service...;Awesome service..
5;Robert's American Gourmet Pirate's Booty;This product was quite delicious.  Unusual, to find something that tastes this good that is not unhealthy.
2;"""Strawberries, not pears / make for tastier wares. So says Mr. Stewart.""";"OK, I'm coming into this ignorant of the fiber/no fiber controversy.  I bought a jar in preparation for making the Sinner's Sandwich from cult video game fave ""Deadly Premonition"" (recipe: turkey, jam, and cornflakes)."
5;Good Coffee, Good Price;"Compared to overpriced coffee out there this coffee is a bargain.  Some ""big"" names are beans from the same source with their name on the bag."
5;Fantastic!!;I had tried Wabash Vally Farms popcorn before and sought out a place where I could purchase it online.  I can sometimes find it in my area and but only in small quantities.
5;Love this Product;I absolutely love this product.  I was a bit concerned with living across the country from where a frozen product was being shipped, but the customer service of the company is extraordinatry and the items were packed perfectly.
5;So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.;Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.
4;Pretty good deCaf;I have tried a number of different DeCaf K-Cups.  Most are pretty weak and rather insipid.
5;Organic Flaxseed Natural Fibromyalgia Relief;Fibromyalgia sufferers..
5;Really good food;Love this babyfood company. They make their babyfood very healthy.
5;Best gourmet raw chocolate bar;I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand.
5;Just what I needed;Before I had a cabinet full of boxes that were clumsy to manage.  This helps keep the coffee organized and easy to access (important on busy mornings).
4;Great Buy;The skull heads were what I expected only bigger, and in my case that took them down a star. But other than that the service was great the speed of the shipment was on point.
5;Fresh, convenient, easy to store;Having never ordered food online before, I was a little leery. However, I decided to take the leap as my husband's birthday was approaching and Slim Jim's are one of his favorites.
4;Spicy Thai;When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy.
4;Addicting;During a recent trip back east, I had a similar item purchased at the Cracker Barrel restaurant. These candies are not quite as tasty, but very close.
5;Great snack!;Product is great, I don't know what happened if the product was exposed to heat because I some of the pieces are stuck together and look like they melted and then took form again.  Not sure in what process this happened at the packing time or shipping.
5;Happy with my purchase.;I'm not so sure what some of the negative feedback is about.  This is canned ravioli, not a gourmet meal.
5;Delicious!;I like using lime or lemon in my tea that I drink everyday and this lime is absolutely delicious.  It adds a nice tart flavor but does not overwhelm the taste of the tea.
5;great product;love these colors they are rich deep colrs that cover easierly. Very happy with product & speed of shipping will use agian when I need more.
5;Instant yeast like any other;"I don't know where the other reviewer got the idea that this is ""compressed yeast."" It comes vacuum sealed so it feels like a solid block until you open it."
5;very quick shipment;The box was too big for the product. For future times, I believe 2 package of Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix would fix into 1 box.
5;vet recommended and we agree, natural is the best....;We recently adopted a shelter kitten and our vet recommended several natural food brands that she felt were superior to our regular supermarket cat food.  As we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said, don't forget to check that her treats are high quality/natural too.
5;yummmm!;I look forward to this coffee in the morning. I think Tully's is the best brand for Kcups I have tried.
5;My cats LOVE this food!;Both of my cats run to their bowl like it's treat time when I open a can of this flavor of Wellness cat food. They are really picky too.
5;This is great stuff!;If you want to kick the coffee habit, it will be easier with Pero.<br />Pero is caffeine free, but still gives that satisfying feeling of a hot drink.
2;Berry  Medley too sweet;Comstock Berry Medley Pie filling is too sweet. I saw this and I thought of all the ways I could use berry medley, but after I made on pie I don't know if I will use the last two cans.
5;My new favorite food!;This peanut butter is delicious! Constituted with water, you can make it thick and fudgy or thin and dippable. The taste is wonderful - - even better than the organic peanut butter I'm used to eating.
5;Delicious!;These are delicious.  A good price, but if you have a BJs membership, you can get for 9.
5;Awsome Cookies;Scott's cookies are nothing short of spectacular. I enjoyed every single one as did my friends.
5;Great tasting, less waste;I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.
5;Time for Tea!;I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.
3;It's okay...;I love soymilk and thought this was a good way to save on $$$..
3;Over Rated/Over Priced;After reading the reviews I decided to try this expensive licorice.  I have purchased many different types of black licorice from Amazon and feel this licorice is definitely overrated and overpriced.
5;Low-cal, great-tasting, natural refreshing drink;This syrup illustrates why the french stay skinny: they don't drink sodas, they drink syrups. The way it works is: when you have a craving for a refreshing, tasty drink, you pour ~1 tablespoon of syrup in a glass, then cover with cold water, or seltzer if you prefer.
1;Crumby packaging;These are extremely thin, delicate cookies. They are delicious, but I will not order them from Amazon again.
1;Price is totally out of line;The juice is good.  However the Amazon price of $14.
5;Delicious;Recently received Tiptree Raspberry Seedless as a gift and I was blown away by the great flavor and aroma. Just raspberries and sugar.
5;Delicious and satisfying;Although the bars are fairly small, I find them to be the perfect thing to tide me over to my next meal and maintain energy levels. I've tried the Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt and the Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants.
5;Love them!;I have bought Happybaby products in the past and love them all!! I was so bummed when their other pouches went off the market! So glad they are back! I love that they have some with veggies in with the fruit, they are the only kind i buy. I have them everywhere!! My son loves them and so do I! They are great for vacation when you can't control meals quite as much as home i know he is still getting some better foods in his diet.
5;CATS;Great  flavor.Great price.
5;Excellent Maple Syrup, Good Value;This is awesome stuff at an unreal price when it goes on sale on Amazon. I ordered twice, and both times received the shipment in 24 hours!<br /><br />We prefer the grade B over the grade A as it has a richer flavor, and is pretty multi-purpose.
4;Yum!!!;The Chocolate Hazelnut Butter is SO awesome! It tastes similar to Nutella but is SO much yummier and healthier..
5;Sweet and delicious;I use Nutiva's mouth watering coconut oil on a nut butter sandwich or as a cooking oil to add a unique flavour to my favorite recipe. I highly recommend you try this oil.
5;My Dog Loves These;My dog loves these sweet potato flavored bones. She's a vegetarian dog.
5;Mom swears by it;This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works.
4;better than those cup noodles...;"well I bought these for my dorm after getting tired of eating those plain 25cent cup noodles. I was surprised by the ""tastiness"" of these noodles."
1;This oder - big mistake!;I had expected the authentic European Edam cheese. It was deplorable in texture and taste.
5;EXCELLENT!;The product arrived quickly.  It was just perfect and although it says it holds 36 K-cups - it actually holds MORE if you turn every other one upside down!  We have our coffee maker sitting on top and just love the convenience of the coffee right there.
5;Urfa or Urfa Biber Pepper Flakes - 2.50 Ounce Jar;I am building my collection of spices as the recipes<br />I make need them. One of the absolute best sources for<br />unusual spices is Amazon.
5;Perfect Shortbread;These cookies are the quintessential shortbread: Rich flavor with lots of butter and sugar, nothing else.  Add them crumbled to a bowl of berries and you have instant pie.
5;Simple Feline Diabetes Test;"This is a terriffic way to confirm a tentative diagnosis of diabetes in a cat without the trauma of taking your cat to the vet or trying to hold a strip to them while urinating.  You sprinkle some sugar-detecting ""confetti"" in the litter box and check it each day for color change."
5;Yummy Flavor!!;These were a hit with the candy buffet group.  The flavor was excellent and the color was spot on.
5;The best!;I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection.
5;Senseo Douwe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods,;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Makes good waffles;Good for you and hard to find in local grocery stores. We mix with egg yolk and buttermilk then fold in a beaten-to-a-foam egg white for fluffy waffles or pancakes.
5;my dog loves these!;I keep coming back for more.  As Jasmine is getting older, she's having to take more and more medications, but she'll do it without any fussing when I offer these treats as a reward.
2;Good Taste, Bad Chunks;As soon as I received my bottle of Chantea I put it in the fridge so I could give it a try.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty neat, a fun shaped bottle with a bright label, the taste is very good.
5;Splenda Sweetemer;Being diabetic, this is a staple in my diet.  I love the deals and service I find on Amazon.
2;Not as good as the smaller boxes;I like AK Mak crackers.  I bought this size box because the AK MAK crackers I usually buy were not available on Amazon.
5;popcorn;great popcorn!! Will pop better if oil is good & hot steaming hot. Still some old maid's but my popcorn machine has hole's to let them fall thru.
4;Love these little gummies!;Love these little gummie bears. Great little treat for my kids, I like them too.
2;Pods too big to fit!!;The coffee is great when it works. The pods are too big to fit the single pod holder, so the machine leaks out the sides about half the time.
5;chicken jerky;I think this is a great product at a great price. My dog (large over 90 lbs.
5;Heaven!;I could eat these all day. Being a diabetic makes this a huge no-no, but the coating compared to the size of the almond makes this a great choice for a once in awhile indulgence.
5;Love, Love, LOVE!;"So far my absolute favorite chips.  I get my ""chip fix"" without the quilt of all those calories."
5;The best;I love these granola bars!  I can honestly say they are the best granola bars I've ever eaten.  They also have protein, and I love eating them just as a snack as well as if I'm on the go or post workout.
5;Strong enough for 12oz + cups;I need to drink decaf in the morning and use a larger travel mug for my early cups of coffee.  While regular decafs dilute on the Keurig 12oz setting, I find the Emeril's decaf stays strong.
5;Organic Nighty Night;I have been using Traditional Medicinals for several years and this is one of my favorites.  I do not sleep well and have difficulty going to sleep as well as staying asleep.
2;After taste from nutraSweet Aspartame;I'm sorry to say even the non diet syrup uses nutrasweet as a sweetener, sadly this makes for a poor taste. I use the original Coke cola Syrup but now having trouble finding it.
4;Not bad;I'm not a big fan of spicy, but I do love regular ranchero sauce, so I gave this a whirl. The 2-tablespoon serving size is a little much - I ended up using about 2.
5;A former addiction of my wife's;I bought the case for my wife's birthday. She loved it! She has since stopped eating Cheddar Bunnies, but not because they're not delicious.
5;Delicious!;A lot of flavors and tastes great. I signed up for a delivery and get it every month or two now.
4;Very Disappointed in  Timothy's;i had earlier bought a box of timothy's 50 breakfast blend kcups and not only got a great tasting coffee, but fast shipping. at the time, timothy's was the only seller i found that sold in this large amount.
4;Duck Treats;Another favorite treat my dogs love.  It is not organic - so I can't give it a 5 star rating - but I am hoping the duck is from a reliable source of humanely farmed U.
5;my cats love this product;It is not cheap..
5;Fantastic gift!;Bought these chocolates as a gift and have been repeatedly thanked and told over and over how fantastic they are.<br />Delivery was super fast and the boxes were well protected.
3;Ok if you use it wisely;In case of any confusion, this is marketed towards ethnic hair as far as a mask.  That being said,  I just have very dry hair, and I've found that it's good as a moisturizer for my ends.
5;SOOOOO good!;I absolutely love these..
5;Great treats and great price.;My dogs love this flavor and I'm happy they are a healthy treat without all the wheat, etc. thanks for providing this much less expensive buying opportunity or I could probably not afford for my dogs.
5;fantastick;i was a die hard Teavana fan until they discontinued (retired) several of my favorite teas<br />including Assam Gold Rain FTGFOP though i had some left i decided to give this a try and was<br />pleasantly surprised, it is full bodied w slight astringent qualities balanced by sweet notes at<br />the start w a nice malty finish.<br />i drink it straight up w raw sugar &/ or raw honey.
5;Good Coffee and great price plus better for environment;Tastes great and cheaper..
5;Very Happy With This Product;The flavor of the salt is very nice ! Purchased it upon reading about it's many health benefits. The price is very reasonable as well.
5;From burr grinder/french press coffee snob to instant - I'm a convert!;Over the years I had become a coffee snob.  Went from ground, to organic ground, to organic whole bean with blade grinder, to organic whole bean with burr grinder.
5;Delicious/Authentic;My Grandfather and Grandmother brought these over from Holland when I was a kid, and I knew they were a favorite. I got these for my grandfather for Christmas and he loved them and the beautiful tin they came in.
4;SuperBall - sharing the fun with my son;When I was 10, back in the late 60's, one of my prized possessions was my SuperBall.  So when viewing an episode of 'George Lopez', the one where he gets his son a SuperBall - I told my own son about mine.
5;Great coffee;I really like Timothy's k-cups.  The choices for decaf, flavored coffee is limited, and I was glad to find one that has such a great taste.
5;So yummy that you will not want to miss trying these!!!;I Love these veggie chips. these chips are so full of flavor that you will not just pop whole chips in your mouth like regular potato chips.
5;Great To Mix In With Regular Dog Food;My dog eats anything and I mean literally, anything..
4;I like that it's grain-free, but it's awfully expensive;I know that grain-based foods are bad for cats. In the wild, they eat meat, not wheat.
4;Good product!;We like these crackers.  No transfats, good nutritional content.
5;Great Snack;I ordered these nuts off a whim because of the flavor. I just got into eating more nuts because I don't get enough Omega 3's.
3;Dreamfield's Lasagna;Product is good but 95% of the pasta arrived broken.  I will stick to the Dreamfields products available in stores from now on.
5;These are really good!;I grab one of these every morning with my coffee. The peanut butter ones are good too but these are my favorite.
5;A pleasing cup of coffee;"I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my ""go-to"" coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor."
4;Good Product misleading ad...;Thought I was saving time by buying online.  The image is of a larger bottle but in the description it is for the smaller bottler.
4;PUCKER UP;I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.
5;Healthy and Tasty;The organic brown rice flour from Arrowhead Mills is a great healthy alternative to white flour. There is a trick to baking it: Pour in a little bit of hot water into the mixture and you won't have any gritty pieces.
3;Comment on new box design...;I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.
5;Nice aroma and good flavor!;The Italian Blend has a nice aroma and good flavor.  I brew it on the 10oz.
3;convenient but weak;Senseo Espresso pads make a decent cup of coffee but I wouldn't call it espresso.  I appreciate the fact the pods are strong enough to make a decent cup of regular coffee and I admit I did not expect the pods to make the thick, rich cup of espresso I'm used to making with an old stove top maker.
3;Aftertaste;"I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking ""fizzies"" many years ago and was shooting for that effect."
5;Thank Goodness For These Little Tasty Snacks;I could eat a devils food cake a day. .
5;Best oatmeal around;This is probably the best oatmeal that I have found.  It has more substance and does not turn slimey.
3;TOTALLY LOVE POPCHIPS!;I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.
4;Works for me...;As a longtime veteran of working in places that operate around the clock, I'm familiar with most tricks of the trade for succeeding in the unnatural act of staying up all night. And while nothing will help you if you don't get most --or all-- of the sleep you need, little things can help.
5;Delicious and easy to prepare!;These are my new favorite product from Omaha Steaks. They are delicious and VERY easy to prepare.
4;Use it for dinner time, fully engaged and learning!;After reading a bit more about toys that encourage learning and rewards, I came across a TON of reviews for this.  At first I wasn't too sure if it was something my puppy would like, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.
2;Another bad reaction. Why risk it?;We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago.
4;Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!;"I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a ""strong"" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee."
2;So so chocolate, Missing ingredient list;Looks very similar to the image provided, but I expected better tasting chocolate.  It tasted stale and definitely not high quality.
5;Taste Great;The new Cheez-It Mozzarella flavored crackers are great tasting. The crunch was transformed into a creamy cheese flavor as I greedily shoveled them into my mouth.
5;Excellent espresso.;This espresso makes great crema with it's 70% robusta blend.  The aroma and flavor match that of some single origin arabica shots I've had as well.
2;A bit disappointing;This was a bit of a disappointment, it offered so much promise but the packaging is a bit vague on how to make the best use of it. I tried to make it up in two different ways but it did not seem to have any taste.
5;pupsend!;I have two yorkies 1 yr old and a 3 year old they can not grasp the concept of fetching any type of ball so thats upsetting and everytime i buy them dingo bones its liek world world 3 in the house and when the wars over i find bones buried in all the furniture and they guard it. with these they know they are treats and they play with them and eat them and its just quiet in the house and all is right in the world.
5;Best brand out there...;I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.
4;Very unique product;I ordered this product to make rose flavored cupcakes.  I got the recipe from a cookbook by the owners of the Primrose Bakery in London.
5;Yummy!;I was lucky enough to find this on clearance at Target for less than $3. I bought one went home and tasted it.
4;Tasty treat that can't be found anywhere in my area (SW Houston);Use to buy these at a store around the corner from a movie theater, but that was back in 2008. I have looked in several groceries and chain retailers but can only find the original gummiburst, not the sour one.
1;Way too expensive, too similar to Marmite;I purchased this product through Amazomn after having used Marmite (from the UK) for some time.  Marmite can be purchased in food stores locally (at least in the MD/DC area) at a fraction of the very high price of this product.
2;Arrived crumbled - dry and stale;These looked so good but arrived crumbled, dry and stale.  A bit disappointed.
5;My Favorite Tea;I love Sleepytime Tea!  I've been drinking it for years.  Very soothing before bed and tastes good too.
1;wimpy;Very cute card came with the seeds, but wow there was like only two seeds smeared on the plastic.  I wanted to laugh.
2;Each one more dented then the next;As a non diary alternative the milk tastes good, a little thick but its not an issue. Most of the cans are really dented, not little dings some of them you cant even open.
5;great product;I received it great condition. Cook just fine.
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;Love, love this with the Ayurvedic White Chai - delicioso;Teavana had the Ayurvedic White Chai combined with this as a store sample. Loved.
4;Nice flavor;I drink Earl Grey almost exclusively and just got a single cup brewer.  This is very good tea, not bitter and has a complex flavor.
1;Inedible!;I love soda probably more than I should and one of my favorite flavors for it is cherry. But this soda was sickeningly sweet.
5;Simply the best;I grew up near Hershey, and Hershey's is what people eat around there.  When I got to college and a German friend introduced me to Ritter Sport, I was hooked.
5;This stuff works great!;This product is great for replenishing your muscles after a tough work out.  I have also used Cytomax during the course of playing pick up basketball and it really keeps me going.
5;Great boost!;I love this stuff!  I sit in front of a computer all day at work, it's easy to get tired, not to mention I've always had trouble sleeping, so I never get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep, more like an average of 4 or 5 hours per night.  I was surprised at how quickly it boosted me but I certainly didn't feel the shakes or jittery at all.
5;Excellent Training Tidbits;I purchased these based on other great reviews, and I'm glad I did! Our newly adopted 40 lb, 9 month old Amstaff/Lab mix is very food motivated and I feel great using these for training without worrying about their health factor. Plus they are absolutely tiny (pencil eraser size).
5;I'm hooked...;..
5;*Tasty* New Flavor From Stella & Chewy's!;I'm glad that Stella & Chewy's has come out with this new flavor of freeze dried raw food for dogs. The SURF N TURF is a combination beef and wild salmon and my Shiba Inu loves it.
5;Liquid Gold;This olive oil is fantastic and I highly recommend using it as part of your regular diet! The taste is much better than the prior store bought brands I've tried in the past and the packaging is nice and slim for storage. As someone that is fairly health conscious, I've done some recent research on the importance of olive oil.
1;Dont waste your time;This has to be the worst Indian packaged food I have ever eaten. Tasted stale and salty.
5;top notch;Bought the popper about two years ago and have been enjoying the delicious fresh buttery salty (as I want) best popcorn ever.  love it and it's a staple snack in our house.
5;my cats love this;My cats absolutely love this stuff..
5;Tasty and convenient;This drink has some zip to it.  It's really tasty and I'm happy it dissolves easily, has vitamins, zero calories, is sugar free and is so convenient.
5;I can't buy enough of this stuff. I use it for everything;I got introduced to coconut oil about 1 year ago and i am crazy about the stuff. I use it for cooking to replace all other oils i used to use.
5;A gift for the glutenly challenged;I really have no choice I have Celiac disease and have to eat gluten free.  I do have vast experience with rice, corn, and even chick pea pasta.
5;Similac Advance;I ordered Similac Advanced for my newborn on the recommendation of my sister (she had used it for her daughter) and of my mother (she had used it for me when I was a baby many years ago). My daughter tolerated it extremely well and within the first month, when other newborns lose weight, she has gained one kg!!! Overall I am extremely happy with it and will continue feeding my daughter with Similac for her whole first year.
5;Fantastic Taste & Price;Found this great coffee for Keurig coffee makers. I still can't believe Amazon is the only place you can find it.
5;My dog loved these...;My dog is a rescued stray.  You'd think she'd be happy to eat any treat offered to her.
5;Excellent Product;Have tried the store found brands and the noodles have not held up to my recipes. These held up and tasted very good.
4;My Picky Dog Loved These!;I have a 9lb dachshund and I didn't notice the size on these when I ordered them and they are recommended for dogs 30lbs and over.  They are large sticks that most adult dogs would eat in a few bites, but this one lasted about 30 minutes for my dog.
5;good price on this on amazon;This stuff is loaded with vitamins essential to energy. I take this instead of coffee on the morning because its caffeine-free way of getting my energy.
1;Not as firm as LA SIRENA...;Majority of the cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol-A which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information.
4;My dog's favorite treat.;We have a St Bernard .  I buy these treats and she loves them.
5;Tastes great!;GoPicnic is a wonderful option for my college aged daughter.  She never really stops to eat, and when she does finally give into hunger it's usually not good food.
4;Yummy chips!;My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring.
5;Tasty and light;Pop Chips are delicious, light and tasty. I bought a box of the Parmesan Garlic and it almost dissapeared before I had a chance to eat some of them.
4;Small but my son likes it;Definately one of the more expensive baby foods.  Smaller container then any others but my son really likes it.
5;Hot Rinds;These are really easy to cook in the microwave and are fresh and warm every time. They are part of my low carb diet and this is a great price.
5;Perfectly Balanced;I think this rub is fantastic! We used it on some pork chops the other day. Rub it over the chops and let them rest for about 20 minutes, then throw 'em on the grill.
5;calming effect;Our female dogs suffer from separation anxiety when we try to leave them to go out to dinner when traveling.  Because of the barking and whining that they could possibly make and fear of pissing off the tenants in the ajoining rooms we end up just eating in our room to keep them calm.
4;Pricey but both cats lost weight;I have two overweight cats that I had been feeding EVO and Newman's Own. What I didn't realize is how many calories these brands have, especially EVO which is packed with dense protein.
4;Better than I thought;these blue corn w/ flaxseed are very filling. They have more flavor than store bought blue corn minus the flaxseed.
5;Perfect Baking Accent;The bumblebees arrived on time, very carefully packaged, with none broken.  They are larger than I expected, and very, very cute.
5;Best Pasta...;"This is the best GF pasta I've tried so far. The texture and taste come the closest to the ""real deal""."
5;Jasmine Tea;Product came promptly. It is well packaged with sealer lid and regular lid.
4;A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags;Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
5;Awesome Taste, Great Aroma!;When I first got my Keurig brewing machine, I was a little skeptical about the quality of coffee any K-Cup could provide. After making a cup of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee using a K-Cup from a sample pack, I now stand corrected! Gloria Jean's makes great coffee to begin with and their Hazelnut coffee in K-Cup form is fantastic.
5;Couldn't taste better!!!;This is the best tea I've ever tasted.  I love tea and this one is my favorite above all others.
1;Slimy and Nasty;This seems like a great idea.  I have read other reviews that say the noodles take on the flavor of what you mix them with and the texture is close to that of regular pasta.
5;Good quality treat but again its made in China;This is a good quality treat and I like the fact that it has some fruit in it.  However, my only unhappiness was that it's made in China.
4;Pretty Damn Good Jerky;I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it..
5;Tasty and Gluten Free!!;Absolutely the best savory nut snacks ever.  I get tired of sweet all the time and these are spicy and good.
5;Great Coffee !;Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee.
5;Lots of tuna, great price!;We buy this as a topper for when our cats decide to be finicky.  They love bonito flakes.
5;Perfect gift;I got these for my husband as a present for Rhamadan along with some ZamZam water.<br /><br />They are not too sweet just the right amount of sweetness, they are a little firm and are a smaller type of date.
5;Yummy!  Yummy!;This chocolate bar was so good.  Dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate and this bar didn't disappoint.
5;yummy;I grew up on the West Coast and I am having a hard time finding Mother's Cookies in NY. I love these cookie and everyone I know are hooked on them.
5;The perfect summer sausage;I finally found the summer sausage that my 7 year old son loves.  He's a very picky eater, but he loves the Old Wisconsin Summer Sausage.
2;tasteless;I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.
4;yummy but expensive;We tried all of Ella's flavors, my 6 month old loved them all.  I tasted them too, yummy!!  My only complaint is that this product is very expensive.
4;Tasty low cal cocktail;This is a delicious margarita mix alternative.  You can even taste the hint of salt and lime in it.
3;Salty;My husband loves beef jerkey, and he will not eat these.  They are way too salty.
5;satisfying;These bars are the most satisfying I have ever eaten.  I carry them in my car and they satisfy my hunger.
5;excellent cereal & delivery;I've loved this cereal for quite some time. Kept running out so when I learned about the subscription option I signed up.
3;Christine Gresock;"I find that I have to use the seven ounce setting on my coffeemaker to brew this coffee, since it seems like a "" weak brew "" to us. I am going to try the extra bold for our next order."
5;Great Maple Taste;I bought this 1/2 gallon because I am a big fan of Grade B maple syrup.  Grade B has a more pronounced maple flavor than Grade A syrup.
2;Kettle Chips;Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat.
1;Not good for doggie digestion;Got two bags of these for my dog.  For some reason they make him have to go poo almost instantly.
2;Not Bad, Not Great Either.;"I tried a box and the best that I can say is, ""It's a little on the bland side"". We had to doctor it up to help it along."
5;Love these, but not the price...;These bread crumbs are soo yummy! I really like them and are great for meatballs, fried chicken/tofu/fish, baked pork chops ect..
4;very good taste;Rich buttery taste and flavor. This rich tea bisquit has soft and rich taste, very good with black tea.
2;Doesn't taste anything like chocolate to me;I have purchased Gevalia flavored coffees for years, so I was looking forward to trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee.<br /><br />Chocolate is my favorite food, period, and I love chocolate truffles.
5;My dog loves the taste.;I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.
5;I Love This Coffee!;A friend of mine knows that I can't get by in the morning without my morning cup of java, so he got me this gourmet blend of coffee to try. Now I am hooked on the stuff and wouldn't consider buying another brand.
5;yum;I like in the united states, and have not seen Chupa Chups in years! I found these and instantly bought them.<br /><br />When i got them i did go through and count them out to see which flavors i got.
5;Best Ever! Roland Red Quinoa 5 lb Bags Very Good!!;Roland's Red Quinoa is very good and comes in a zipper bag and it's prewashed and has excellent nutty flavor. Another great reason why i purchased this brand was the price and taste.
5;Great Jerky;Great Stuff, I think it's better than the real thing and a lot better for your body. My favorite is the hickory smoked because I like spicy foods, but all the other flavors are good to.
4;Sodium: 120mg, not 70mg as reported by Amazon;Just received my shipment. Tasty chips, but as my title says, they have 120mg of sodium which is almost double the amount listed by amazon on the product page.
5;Great Product!  Cheapest on Amazon!;New user of this product
5;My favorite coffee so far;Love this coffee.  I use it at home with an aeropress and at work with a Jura Capresso.
5;Tully's French Roast;"This coffee has turned out to be my very favorite in K-cups.  It is the best of the ""bolds""- full-bodied, rich tasting and is a great way to start my day."
5;Greenies;My dog looks forward everyday to getting his Greenies.  It is a great toothbrush and keeps him from having too much tarter on his teeth.
5;Delicious treat!;The Emerald Dry Roasted Walnuts are a delicious treat that we enjoy having when guests are coming over for cocktails.  We always get excited comments from our guests.
1;reacted very badly to this pasta;My wife and I ate the recommended serving (2 oz dried). It was delicious, and we felt full afterwards.
4;Great but not perfect;You know this stuff tastes really good..
5;Senseo Coffee Pods;Buying coffee this way is a little pricier than just ground coffee for a standard coffee pot, but it has actually saved us bundles.  My son and husband always wanted specialty coffees, e.
5;Great stuff!;Simple though it may  be, this is truly wonderful. Like Gortex, Velcro or Moleskin, it's hard to believe a product is so miraculous, so simple and so good.
5;helps a lot during workouts;The mix helps a lot during workouts although this might be a subjective judgment. I definitely would order this mix when I finish this pack and consider other products by this company.
5;MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!!;Plenty of variety, almost all of which are delicious. Chocolate-filled cookies, chocolate-covered cookies, white chocolate.
5;Awesome product;How can you go wrong with a 100% fruit snack that is both crunchy and delicious? The three flavors are all great. Granny Smiths are a little tart (in a good way), Fujis are sweet, and Cinnamon are absolutely delicious.
5;My favorite tea;Typically I don't like green tea, but this tea doesn't taste anything like the typical green tea!  The lemongrass, spearmint, and passion fruit flavor keep it from being bitter, and make it very tasty.  I also find that when I drink this, it soothes minor heartburn and stomaches.
5;Fantastic;Wonderful packaging, small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need. Clean tiny boned (very edible) fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings.
5;Anxiety Gone! A MUST for everyone!;I have just ended a 2+ year custody battle. Needless to say I have anxiety & I'm set off at the slightest thing.
5;Can't be beat;If you are looking for good old fashioned licorice made the correct way then this is it!! Great soft texture, true licorice taste - a must have for all ex-pats from Down Under who are looking for a taste from home (Sorry Aussies it even beats Darrell Lea). This Kiwi gal is VERY happy to have found it on Amazon.
1;poor service;No customer service or follow up after you make a complaint. Go to another store, you pay alittle bit more but atleast you will get some service.
4;I like all the Celsius Drinks;Celsius drinks are low carbonated and that is important to me.  My very favorites are the orange and the wildberry.
5;Perfect light blend.;I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.
5;Another Favorite;Have recently tried this k-cup coffee and found it to be very good.  Have used the Timothy Italian blend and enjoyed that roast.
4;Calming Tea;I really like the taste of this tea, seems to be calming before I go to bed. Not sure about how much it helps with sleep.
5;Great work and on the go tea;I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.
5;couldnt be happier;plant arrived very much on time. packaged very well.
2;Please take the corn syrup out of the recipe!;I just bought 2 bags of the product. Tried and it was all PRO's until I noticed the big CON: one of the ingredients is corn syrup! I usually eat all organic food and love healthy stuff - I'm sooooo against corn syrup.
2;SUGAR!!;I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THE LIPTON ICED GREEN TEA MANDARIN AND MANGO UNDER SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE FOR A LONG TIME.  AMAZON INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
5;Enjoyed by 3;The Merrick Toothpicks are great.  We have been giving them to our dogs for a long time now and they just love them.
4;Delicious, a great snack;These bars remind me of a Payday but not quite as sweet (fine by me).  Definitely recommended for peanut fans.
5;Great product!;I am a big fan of spicey foods. This Cayenne pepper adds the heat to any dish.
1;crunchy raisins?;I really liked the original granola, so I thought I would try it with raisins. The raisins were so hard they were crunchy.
5;A real Gold - Gold not Yellow!;This Wilton pearlized gold sugar looks like very pretty real gold. I was a little worried that in person this sugar would look like a yellow, mustardy gold.
5;Our dogs second favorite everlasting treat;I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is with this barbecue version coming in close second! These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.
5;My dog loves them;I am actually subscribing to this item. It contains natural ingredients and my dog is crazy about them.
5;Great for Celiacs;I really LIKE this cereal, as opposed to..
2;Too Pricey;I bought the product and the colours are beautiful and it arrived speedily, but boy are the packets small!  Ok so the weight checks out.  I just somehow imagined it to be a bit bigger.
3;Ultimate Organic Nibs Taste More Chocolate-y;Love love love the nibs. I have tried this brand initially before moving on to a cheaper brand that tastes more chocolate-y!Ultimate Superfoods nibs are the best of the two but you can't get them on amazon.
5;success;My fussy spoiled mutts really like this food.  Not made in USA is a worry but so far so good.
5;Best Gummy Bears EVER!;I first had these gummy bears in 1983. They were not available for purchase in the US at the time.
3;So sorry.  Chai just didn't think it was a good cup of tea.;Although the box states that this Higgins and Burke Chai Black Tea includes the robust flavor of Assam tea, I found it to be a rather bland cup of tea.  I much prefer the full-bodied flavor of Teavana's Samurai Chai blend - with its infusion of oranges and cinnamon.
2;Everlasting Treat Ball - My Dog Destroyed It On The Ride Home;I bought an everlasting treat ball because everyone told me how wonderful they are, and I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is fairly calm for the breed, but does tend to have a bit of a seperation anxiety problem as soon as I leave.  I got it yesterday, popped the caps on either end of the ball, and gave it to him on the five mile ride back to my apartment.
5;Like a regular cookie;My 5 yo loves these cookies.  There are very few gluten free, egg free cookies out there that taste good, and these are one of them.
5;They are what they are;I bought these pop tarts to stock my dorm room with breakfast material for when I rush out in the morning with 10 minutes until class starts.  They work perfectly fine for this purpose - they arrived in a large box with 8 smaller boxes in it, as stated in the description.
5;kind bars;The only problem with this bar is that once you try it you can't seem to do without it, it tastes that good.<br />Dr.
5;Excellent Grain-Free Option;I ordered the Wellness Turkey to create a rotation for our kitten with Felidae grain-free formula. Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation.
5;Back to the oven;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;mostly un-natural, white potatoes, hydrogenated oil, cornsyrup and chemicals, NOT YAM, contains sulfites (dangerous for some);"Very disappointed in this product!  NOT Yam--it is Potatoes.  Item description states ""all-natural"" pounded Yam."
5;Cheaper than anywhere else;I used to buy this same powder at Wholefoods for double the price. Same stuff great price, and now I have it on order every month even cheaper.
4;Delicious jerky;This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.
5;Awesome;Great product, my dog loves them, and they are small enough that I don't feel bad using them a ton for training. They helped me potty train my puppy in 30 days.
5;untitled;I usually give my kitten Catswell treats, because they are straight forward with ingredients, and use cage free chicken.  Well Petco did not have them in stock so this looked like a good alternative.
1;Ugh *Awful Face* Spitting out over the sink rinsing my mouth;I love other Larabar products (and have them in my cabinet currently).  This one however shouldn't have ever made it through their testers.
3;Liked them better when the piece size was larger...;These are ok but I'm not sure if I'll get them again. There are other options as far as low carb that seem to be a better snack option.
5;Awesome flavored chips!!;I love these apple chips!  I like the Strawberry best.  It is such a great alternative to fatty chips & great for kids' lunches.
4;Not Bad So Far;I've only used this product to make pancakes so far, but so far, so good.  Except of course for the first attempt.
5;I prefer Stash tea over Tazo;I always enjoyed Tazo tea (Earl Grey being my favorite) but while at a restaurant one evening, they only carried Stash. I couldn't believe the difference in both taste & aroma, it was so much better! When using tea bags, I recommend giving it a try.
4;One of the best tasting instant coffees I've tried, and I've tried many!;All 100% Colombian instant coffees (100% Arabica)always taste better than ordinary/regular instant coffees which are a blend of the cheaper, inferior Robusta beans and the more expensive but superior Arabica beans.  That being said, I like to emphasize that this is likely the best tasting NESCAFE instant coffee,  being made from 100% Arabica beans.
5;Best Honey on the Planet!!! And I have tried a LOT...;I have been buying this Honey for 5 years, since I first was lucky enough to find it in an Organic Grocery Store. I have tried every kind of organic/raw honey brand out there, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and this is by far the best flavor and the best price.
5;Simple, Amazing, Delicious;I'm a huge tea drinker
4;A little different than I thought;I am not saying I don't like this product, it smells very good. Our husky loves them but we also have a Maltese and I bought them for her but they are a little large and also very hard and for some reason I guess I had in my mind they might be a little softer.
4;It is tasty.;This is tasty. I liked it.
5;Great Product  High Price;It does taste like maple syrup but I don't know why the cost on Amazon is $9.00+ when you can buy it directly from Josephs for $2.
5;Great herbal tea for cramps;"My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup."
5;Like cheetos for babies;My baby is almost 8 months old and she's showing an interest for finger foods. She hasn't learned the pincher grasp with her fingers yet so she can't feed herself cheerios but she sure loves to hold sticks of food in her hands.
5;FANTASTIC;so far, by far, the best K-Kup. I like strong coffee.
5;One of my dog's favorite toys!!!;My sister bought this for her 2 weims who are both aggressive chewers. I've never seen toys destroyed so fast! They both LOVE this toy and it lasts quite awhile.
5;Hot & Spicy;When i received the hot sause, i tried a drop on my tongue..
5;Great tea;I haven't tried it with milk yet as many reviews suggest, but it is amazing even without it. Buy it, you won't regret it.
5;Very Impressive;"I was very impressed with the service I received when I ordered the Sugar Daddies for my invalid sister. She was so excited when she received a ""home delivered"" package."
5;"""WHAT THE ....""";I ordered Bartenders Whiskey Sour Mix about 6 months ago for $26.00.
5;Perfect Cup of Joe!;I just finished this package of coffee, and I'm going right out to buy another package of it!  I've enjoyed this Starbucks Natural Fusions, Vanilla so very much.  It has just the right amount of bite, sweetness, and beautiful aroma.
1;Don't try it;It is that taste..
4;Too sweet for me, but the rest of the family likes it;My husband and two boys, 3 and 1, all like these little cookies so much that all of them took more than the serving size. I let them eat them freely because I'm OK with the ingredients.
5;surprise!  i really like this stuff.;i'm not usually a big vanilla or super sweet-tea fan but with the colder weather i've found myself gravitating to heartier, sweeter and more dessert-like beverages. i was craving hot chocolate and decaf coffee a lot but didn't like the chocolate tea i bought and am too lazy to make a good cup of decaf most of the time.
4;Great variety, could have been shipped in a box;I ordered this for my new Keurig with the hopes to find a brand, flavor I liked. I received a brown paper sack with 35 k cups.
4;Great Coffee - Beware Pierced Packages;This is very good coffee and makes excellent Espresso, especially if you use a stove stop Espresso maker. I use a 6 cup Espresso maker with two heaped tea spoons of coffee to make a full mug full, topped off with fat free Half & Half.
3;Not sticky enough;If you want non-sticky rice, buy Californian rice. This was supposed to be STICKY rice and fails in that department.
2;$7.37 price increase in 3 months ?!?;The last time I bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on April 12, 2012.  The price was $28.
5;Pancakes, cookies and more;We use this flour for pancakes, muffins, biscuits and more.  I have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes.
5;Awesome taste!;I love this product.  I always leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated and I love the subtle coconut taste.
5;great healthfood bar;This is a great healthfood bar that is very satisfying and tastes great!  Even my picky eaters in the house like it.  The cashews are wonderful and you can't even tell that you are eating dates!  Love them!  We eat them all the time for quick breakfasts or afternoon snacks.
1;Defective K-cups!  Great Coffee, but only 1 in 3 K-cups not defective;This product that comes in the Amazon packaging is defective. It appears in an attempt to save cost, too little foil material is used to seal the top of the K-cup.
5;My dogs love it;I have two dogs at home, and my sister has another. One of my Pomeranians is extremely picky which makes it difficult to purchase treats or even foods that he isn't already familiar with, because it's more likely than not that he will reject whatever I get him.
5;Nutty tast, great texture;My seven year old son who has severe food allergies loves this bread.  The Tapioca Loaf is too dry and dense with no flavor, but he loves the flavor and texture of this bread.
5;Excellent product and service;I received my order in just two days.  I was a little reluctant to order since the last time I purchased Rooibos tea (African Red Bush Tea) was in a health food store.
4;Rich, bold flavor....makes a lot of coffee!;Update: I have come to realize (from others) that this is meant to be used in one specific machine. Unfortunately, that was not apparent at the time of my selection, and I just thought they were tea bag type coffee-bags.
4;Good Value...;Love the zip lok bags.  Nuts were not salted, lacked the hulls that help provide fiber and additional vitamins.
5;Amazing flavor;Open the bag, close you eyes, and smell--you'd swear it was popcorn from the movie theater. As a suffer of diverticulosis I cannot eat popcorn (the hulls are the problem).
5;Great Coffee;I'm a coffee snob and for many years have always bought flavored beans and ground them myself before each cup I'd brew.  Checking out what Amazon had to offer, I came across the Melitta Hazelnut brand and thought I'd give it a try.
5;Good Product and Excellent Customer Service;At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.
3;Good halva... perfect for gift giving;I wanted to try halvah and see how it tastes. So I bought this brand.
5;Just as tasty as the frozen.;I was a little leary of getting my favorite frozen juice in a can.It is very good and had a good expiration date.
4;Not a full container;The container was only half full but it tasted good, kinda expensive for only half a jar..
4;Good product-Below average seller!;I purchased both the Medium roast capsules & the Dark roast capsules..
3;the same as everything;These are good treats, but I can not say that they are any better than any other. They are bassically the same as any average treat.
5;LOVE this coffee!;I am not a flavored coffee person, so this is the one I choose to drink ALL the time! love this breakfast blend..
5;French vanilla cappuccino;Loved this product, highly recommend it. If you like cappuccino you will love this.
5;Good Breakfast;My 18m old loves this for his morning breakfast. This is one of the few flavors he will eat.
4;Okay, so it's not peanutbutter - wait, yes, it is!;Yeah, you have to add some water to it and you have to be good at that to get something you want to eat, but it's not impossible. Just have to pay attention.
5;Refreshing. Nice Tasting. Long Lasting.;Well, I was at the neighborhood grocery store with my little boy (3) and we were going past the candy isle. Any of you with kids knows what that means.
5;Can't argue with the reults!!;I saw this at my local grocery store one day.I just got sick of being slow and over weight by 10 pounds.
5;Dog-gone Good;I used to feed my Shelly Pro Plan's Chicken and Rice formula, however, Purina changed it by making  a shredded blend which consists of regular nuggets with shredded, beige pieces.  Shelly does not like the new blend and I had a hard time getting her to eat it.
5;Nostalgia;The pralines arrived in good shape and in a timely manner. It was a trip down memory lane for me, because being from the South.
5;Great Cola Taste;"The tase of this cola is better than the ""REAL"" cola.  I drink 1/3 of a liter of this cola and then I switch to a non-caffine cola of which I drink 2/3 of a liter daily."
3;Good size, but just too sweet;Caramel corn by itself would have been great. The chocolate drizzle was kind of overkill.
5;Mystery flavor is cool;Everyone in the family love this mystery flavor. Just wish the flavor would last a little longer.
5;Yummy!;With gluten free kids, it is hard to find a fun granola bar to ease their hunger after school and before sports, dance, etc.  We've tried other peanut butter and chocolate chip bars and none live up to the taste and texture of the Bakery on Main Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Granola Bars.
5;Great Deal If You're Hooked On Starbucks Coffee!;My local grocery store charges $9.95 per 12 oz bag of French Roast which is the only Extra Bold Starbucks which they sell.
5;THE HIT OF THE LADIES GET TOGETHER;This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season.
3;Earth friendly, but could have a little longer life;The bags start to decompose right in the plastic garbage bin for food waste under my sink in just 4-5 days. It starts leaking.
1;They were terrible!!;I had great hopes that this was the answer for my pasta cravings.  Wrong!!!  I bought a big box of 15 packs of noodles.
1;unpleasant aftertaste;Bought the coffee at Shop Rite expecting a nice brew.  This coffee had a very unpleasant aftertaste.
3;The quality of the chicken is questionable;I just discarded 20% of the bag.  Some of the pieces had chicken veins (dark purple spots), others had fatty parts to them.
5;Non-Fat Dessert;While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying.
5;a great organic snack;i try to find healthy orhanic snack for my kids. especially my 1 1/2 yr old.
1;Too expensive;It's cheaper to buy the bottles at the grocery store than on here. This is WAY too expensive.
2;Go for Pinhead Gunpowder instead...;"Having purchased a package of this tea and one of Stash's Pinhead Gunpowder Green, I can safely say that the Gunpowder is much better tea. The ""Organic Premium"" is unacceptably heavy on stems and twigs, with an unpleasantly mulchy taste."
5;So Good!;So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.
5;Great taste for those who enjoy flavored coffee;"I really enjoy this coffee as does my school-teacher daughter.  My husband REALLY dislikes flavored coffee so it's so great to pop in the Hazelnut for me and then let him have his choice of ""un-flavored"" coffee."
5;Love the little packages;These are the best gummy bears. They were very fresh.
3;Not worth of price;This cliff bar is much more expensive than the nature valley products. But, it is not worth to be pricey.
4;Nice taste, not that hot though;I just received the spice bottle of this ghost pepper salt. Large crystals like you'd expect from sea salt, infused with ghost pepper.
2;Just tastes sweet, not like mango or peach;I prepared this according to directions on the bottle:  One squeeze of MIO liquid (about 1/2 teaspoon) in an 8 ounce glass of water.  I was put off by the color immediately:  Why this stuff has to have so much artificial coloring in it is beyond comprehension.
5;Many handfuls of deliciousness;The quality is always excellent
5;Delightful!;I love Larabars in general, they're wonderfully portable, filling, and the most straightforwardly healthy/unprocessed bars widely available in my area.  The cherry pie flavor in particular is fun because of its unabashed tangy-cherry taste, the mix of sour-sweet and nutty is perfect.
5;a hit with my kids;This will be a staple in my kindergarterner's lunch box. 100% fruit and tastes great.
5;Please continue to sell.;Enough of these misinformation.<br /><br />The FDA has investigated this product since 2007 and have not found any problems with the product.
3;Decent gum;This gum isn't bad.  I've had better xylitol gum with more mint flavor, but I will use this.
2;Most of the Cans Were Dented;I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house.
5;Enjoyable Tea;I don't know if it gave me any energy but it was a fine tasting, smooth tea. The vanilla and spice is a nice combination.
5;My cat loves it;I was a little worried my cat might not like this food after reading some of the reviews. I bought the Turkey and Salmon Formula and this is the best purchase I have made for my cat so far.
1;Barely Miso;Not a good product. Soup box covers were partially off.
5;A Favorite Thing!;Leila's macarons are beautiful and very delicious. The packaging is so attractive, it's hard to bring oneself to open it.
5;Overpriced on here!;There are the best popsicles ever, they don't free to hard and they are great flavors..
3;Warning;NOT GLUTEN FREE. I will update this when Amazon finally changes the description, it blows my mind that something so important wasn't fixed in a more timely manner.
4;A very nice, smooth, Americano style coffee;I bought a Wolfgang Puck sampler and this was certainly one of my favorites, so I ordered a bigger box and have truly been enjoying it.  This is a classic, medium-roast cup of coffee.
5;Beautiful Tomato Plants;These refills are currently growing into healthy, beautiful tomato plants in my kitchen.  They were delivered early and are growing right on schedule.
5;GF too!;I started using these years ago when gluten-free products (specifically bread) were pretty bad.  They're a great alternative to bread for rolled sandwiches in addition to Asian recipes.
5;great chili in under 2 minutes;i like the spicy..
5;best robust decaf;If you like a really strong cup of coffee, you will not be disappointed in this one.  We have tried many, many decafs.
5;Just like peanut butter!!!;Finally, a guilt free version of one of my favorite spreads. You can read up on the nutritional info, how they make this as well as find recipes on the manufacturer's website [.
3;"Gets an ""mediocre"" from a non-coffee person";First a warning - I'm not a coffee person.  I generally don't drink coffee and I definitely don't pay $5 for a grande tall whatever the heck.
5;Great Tasting!;Coffee tastes great and is great for those who like coffee to be on the stronger side. Comes in one large box but that's not a problem because it saves on the packaging etc.
1;FDA Warning !  Poison! Made IN China !;PLEASE research, on the web! This product nearly killed my dog! All of Dogswell jerky treats are Poison!! Made in China! This Dist. does not seem to care he is killing our pets.
5;Excellent, Awesome Product;This is great red palm oil.  Even though most people are using it to cook with, the health benefits are much greater if you do not heat it.
3;Product is great, delivery needs improved!;I love this product but I'm really disappointed in how they were delivered.  Both boxes were crushed (Amazon and Stacey's)and when I opened the inside box, one of the bags of chips was split open at the top and chips were everywhere.
3;Flawed design;This infuser is better than many but falls short of its promise.  It's deep depth means it can be used in almost any sized cup or teapot.
4;Good cookies... Order filler AND tummy filler!;I must confess I bought these cookies just to round up my Amazon order from $19 to $25..
5;This stuff is great!!;This tea not only  aids in digestion, but this tea also has a calming affect..
5;"very good price for 1 jar---ad should remove ""12 pack"" designation";This is a great organic coconut oil, with all the benefits of unrefined WITHOUT the coconut odor. Those who use coconut oil to fry eggs, vegetables, and hamburgers may prefer to have these foods without a coconut aroma.
5;Yummy!;I love this stuff!  I wish I could find it sold somewhere.  I've had the other flavors, which I can find at Trader Joe's, but Mango and the Green Apple I have to order here on Amazon.
3;doenst work to reheat/defrost right in jar or glass container;I think this machine is nice and the steam and blend cycle is nice but it takes an insignificant amount of extra time to dump food from basket directly into the blending container in the Beaba.  So as far as this difference I don't really think it is significant enough to go with the Brezza.
5;Lavazza Coffee;Just made the first pot this Saturday morning for the wife and myself.  Used a burr type coffee grinder and used my drip type coffee maker.
5;How Business Should Be Done;I have heard good things about this product so I sent it to my Father for Father's Day.  I don't know if he has used it yet, and I have never tried it, so I can't say anything about the product.
5;MMMMMMMM  Good!;IF, I repeat IF you are just looking for an all fruit carbonated replacement for soda..
4;Bubble Gum Cigarettes - 24 Packs;ASIN B0001G8W0I - Since real cigarettes don't taste anything like these things, you can rest assured your kid isn't going to start looking for a nicotine fix just because s/he was allowed to have bubblegum cigarettes. Just in case you're one of those parents who worries about those things.
5;The best cured chorizo in the USA;I am a Spaniard, and this brand is simply the best cured chorizo you will find in the USA.  Some easter european ignorants reviewing this product think is fresh chorizo and try to use it in paella (moreover.
4;Primo coffee, crazy high price;I like the Keurig coffee system in general. Most of the coffee selections are OK, some are quite good.
5;Sogave RAW Blue Agaive Nectar;The Sohgave RAW Blue Agave Nectar is fantastic! The taste is very much like honey only more light and clean. It works fantastic in any recipe one wishes or needs a sweetener for.
5;Next best thing to the real deal this side of the ocean!!!;We are a Swiss household and we are used to Swiss muesli and this one is the one that I like most because of the crunch. Quite satisfying, not like the cardboard type you can buy here, and not super loaded with sugar like some store offerings.
5;ABSOLUTELY PERFECT;I've ordered these from Amazon several times.  Orders have always been timely and the product has been perfect.
2;The bars are a lot smaller than expected.;I was disappointed in the size of the fig bars. I received some as a gift in the past, and they were three times the size of these bars.
5;Best House Blend;I am a picky coffee drinker and really like this House Blend by Tully. Very rich but smooth taste.
1;Doesn't ship well;I love this product, but it did not ship well.  It has a pull off lid and a number of the cans' tops were disturbed and the contents leaked.
5;Smooth and Tasty;I have been looking for a really good Expresso coffee and  I finally found it. I used this in my regular Mr.
5;I'm switching!;I have been ordering Coffee People's Jet Fuel K-cups for years.  I never really liked wasting all the plastic so I was happy to give these a try.
4;India Tree DOES NOT contain toxic chemicals.;I spoke to a woman at India Tree at length about their ingredients. She said that for a short run of the product, they used a formulation that included propylene glycol and polysorbate to help preserve them and keep them from separating.
5;YummyEarth is definitely Yummy!;We absolutely love these lollipops..
5;Energy Drink Flavor is Spot On!;I have to say that if you are a fan of the energy drink with the initials R B (moo) then you will be a HUGE fan of this. The flavor is a perfect match.
1;sauerkraut;Sauerkraut from Libby's seemed to be a good choice.  Product is usually reliable and tasty.
4;A good chocolate caramel;This is another item that I buy in bulk.  The price for the 3 lb.
2;Need a lot of coffee to brew a cup;This may be labeled a medium roast but the cups it brews more closely resemble dirty water. It takes a lot of grounds to brew a cup that has any flavor at all.
5;Natural, naked, hard to resist!;Well, not actually naked..
1;What's up with the price?!?;I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68.
4;Great for breakfast;I love anything dark chocolate and these special K bars did not disappoint me. I have been eating them for breakfast and they are enough to keep me full until lunch time.
5;Very pleased--24 cans, a good deal;From Italy, low sodium (the entire can has about 250 grams of sodium). They are plump and tasty, great to mix with rice, to add to soups and chili, etc.
2;Didn't appeal to me at all;This K-Cup was one of the samples that came with my Mr. Coffee BVMC-KG1 Single Serve Brewing System, Silver.
4;Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .;My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc.
5;Wonderful flavor;My cousin brought me a tin of loose leaves Lady Gray when she visited from the UK last summer. I just tried it and wish I'd done so sooner! I think it's delicious and as others have said, lighter than Earl Gray.
3;misleading;This is not a negative against the product but against the way this product is listed. This is listed as  one of six in multiple places but then it is listed as 48oz also.
5;Good deal and good selection of coffee;This was not only a good deal but also a great variety of coffee flavors.  You get about 8 or 9 different flavors with anywhere from 3 to 5 of each.
5;My dogs love these!;I feed my two dogs organic food, so it makes sense to serve them organic snacks. My dogs love these heart shaped, peanut butter biscuits.
1;Vet says NO;These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems.
3;Popcorn addict;I was looking for popcorn with less hulls.  Have been using Oroville R's microwave popcorn for years and have noticed more and more hulls which are not great for the teeth!  I found the Amish country popcorn somewhat as advertised.
5;Fantastic Fudge !!;I received this Fudge in just a few days and the Fudge is just Marvelous !!  It was like pure heaven eating this wonderful fudge and I Will be Ordering Again.<br /><br />I also contacted Customer Service and they are Just Great about that to.
5;Quick & Easy;I couldn't find this flavor of Crystal Lite in 7 large chain grocery stores.  It was great finding it on the web, and with quick efficient delivery.
4;Pretty Good Option for Gluten Free;We buy these to keep on hand when time is short and we need a quick snack between school & sport practices. There are not a lot of gluten free options that are not high in added sugar.
1;This is the worst product I've ever purchased.;The rice had mold and what appeared to be spider webs inside the package.  After opening the plastic bag, you could actually smell an old oily odor.
5;Great little boost;I have enjoyed these ever since they came out.  I agree with another reviewer - do not take all of the time or your body will start to adjust and get used to it.
5;Best Rice Mix Ever!;This whole grain rice mix is versatile and is an everyday staple at our house. Excellent quality and a good cooked result every time.
5;hmmm hmmm good!;The wife takes cup a soup to work to have with her lunch or for a quick pick me up. The local grocers don't carry this in our neighborhood so it's Amazon to the rescue.
5;Glad I Finally Found This Again!;I don't know why grocery stores in my area are no longer stocking this particular flavor of ramen, but I'm glad to have found it on Amazon because it's the only flavor my son will eat.  He likes the spicier flavors, but has a health condition that causes great stomach upset if he eats them, so this is a blessing for both of us.
5;no actual product reviews that are negative...;Has anyone noticed that none of the Betty Crocker Gluten Free mixes have gotten any negative feedback from anyone who has actually TRIED the product?  Just a lot of whining from people who complain about how hard it is to research a gluten free diet but then don't even know enough to call Betty Crocker if they have a question.  I have Celiac disease too and am just thankful the disease is getting enough attention that a mainstream manufacturer will invest huge $$$ in developing products for us.
4;If you like chocolate...;you will love this stuff.  It has all the dark semi sweet chocolate pieces that you could want in a granola.
5;A Cookie for Grown-Ups;I am one of those people who has a disgustingly ravenous sweet tooth. Almost any sweet treat will do but of late I have been making an effort to go for fruit over cookies.
1;Disgusting.;This was the first Mio that I tried. It tastes NOTHING like lemonade.
5;Lightly salted, yet tasty;This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted.
5;Great Taste;The coffee has a bold without bitterness taste.  It is very delicious.
5;Favorite Treat;My dog loves Zuke's and so do I especially because it's made in the USA.<br />I have the Chicken treats as well but when he smells these he goes crazy for them.
3;Not as good as original formula;"""New"" cytomax formula doesn't taste quite as good as original, but still not bad.  New formula doesn't mix as well, tends to clump and settle on bottom of bottle."
1;Hate this tea;This tea tastes terrible. I was very disappointed.
5;AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!;This is the best thing ever invented!  I have a 15-year-old Bichon who I have tried everything..
5;Maggie Loves Them!;The reviewing options are limited for dog treats.  All I know is my dog, Maggie, finished off the bag over a period of weeks (they're treats, not gorge-fest meals).
3;Yeah, I can't use these...;Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.
5;Rich and chocolaty;Another great hit from Coffee masters!  This one has a rich, dark chocolate flavor that's not too intense but just right.  The coffee is foll-bodied and very smooth.
5;Absolutely wonderful tea;I received a tin of this tea from my cousin who had brought it over from Germany. I have honestly never tasted a better tea, and the aroma is amazing.
1;Poor quality and size;Buyer beware.  I am very disappointed in this product.
1;Weak;Taste is very weak and didn't improve with coffee creamer. Sorry but this box is a dud.
5;Great for the spicy food aficionado!;Do you like to munch on some popcorn while watching a movie at home?  Do you like serious heat in your food (i.e.
4;Great flavor;This is really good coconut milk. It has given some incredible flavors to dishes.
5;Wonderful product!!;This salt is so pink and taste like the ocean, I love it. Make sure to buy a grinder of some sort if you plan to use it on salads or sprinkle on cold dishes.
2;Cheaper Local Alternative Available.;Admittedly it has been a while since I've had an actual Nestle Lion Bar, but what I remember is that it is almost exactly the same as a Cadbury Mr. Big bar which is available in North America, except the Lion Bar is about 2/3 the size, and doesn't have peanuts.
3;Not very sweet and has a slight chemical taste;I was disappointed with this. It doesn't taste that sweet and also has a chemical after taste.
3;crumbly with odd aftertaste;I love Betty Crocker GF mixes, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found it to have kind of an odd aftertaste, and the cookies just didn't hold together for me at all.
5;Simply delicious.;These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly.
5;It's curry-tastic!!!;I have been a fan of S&amp
2;nasty gum;It was awful had to give the product away to uspecting children. I would never buy stride gum of any kind again, never.
5;Best K-Cup,hands down...;I have tried all the Coffee People flavors (Jet Fuel, Tiger, Wake up Call,) as well as most of the Green Mountain flavors. I have found that the Sumatra by SB is the best tasting one of them all.
5;We love it;Everyone in our family loves this cereal -- parents and kids. Just the right amount of sweetness.
5;CHOCOLATE SWEETS!;This was given as a gift to a friend of mine who showed wonderful hospitality during a recent trip I took. He loves coffee and enjoys chocolate and the result was a very happy person.
5;Fantastic noodles;My husband loves these noodles.  His mother used to make them for him and I was so happy to find a brand as good as the ones his mom used to buy.
3;Too sweet;This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects.
5;great treats;My dog loves these treats! Most important is that they are healthy for her. She gets the omega3 &6,antioxidants, and glucosamine.
5;GOOD TOFU;Good firm texture, comparing to other silken firm, this is just the right consistency. Hassle-free, it is easy to come out from the container Tofu shape as is.
1;Not quite right.;It smelled like it, but this tastes closer to Rooibos than chocolate and hazelnut.  And I do not like Rooibos.
4;Nice drink;I am not sure why all the negativity about this product. I think it tasts pretty good.
5;Best Decaf Ever;I didn't think I would like any decaf other than Starbucks but I decided to give this a try since I liked their non-decaf. I was pleasantly surprised.
5;Tastes better than other drinks and is much cheaper!;I buy these online in bulk because I drink two of them a day. They taste far better than any other energy drinks I've tried (I can't believe how utterly nasty some energy drinks are!).
2;Carmel macchiato;The Carmel macchiato is a bit to sweet for me . If you like sweet , that's the one for you to buy .
5;The Best Gluten Free Bars!;I bought a box of the Mango Macadamia KIND bars from Amazon, since I had not seen that flavor at the stores.  They have a really delicious fresh fruity tropical sort of taste.
5;Wow.;I have suffered with insomnia for the past 10 years.  This product cured it.
5;Love It!;The product is excellent and the price for a pack of 50 was outstanding!!!<br />When you drink as much coffee as I do, you need lots of back up! It was shipped in a matter of days and it was in perfect shape. Thank you Amazon.
5;What it's supposed to be;If you drink a lot of Gatorade, mixing your own with the powder is MUCH cheaper than buying the bottles. Your water quality will affect the taste, but we have good tapwater where we live, so this isn't a problem.
5;Excellent service!;A great gift product, much appreciated by recipients.  We had a little trouble with the shipment and customer service was superb-exceptionaly responsive and helpful.
5;Senna Leaf;I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby.
3;doesn't work for all cats;This is a great idea for giving pills to cats. I am sure that this works wonderfully with cats who love dry treats.
5;Love the flavor, hard to find in Wally World;I'm a gourmet cook that doesn't like American food because it's bland.<br />Cardamon is excellent in stews, & better yet in this gum.
5;Phenomenal!;You'll be hard pressed to find a better tasting bar than this one, 10/10.  I'd choose this bar over any candy bar in the supermarket based on taste alone.
5;Awesome and delicous!;We love Lyle's at our house!  It takes the place of Corn Syrup in all our recipes.  It tastes very good in my homemade granola bar recipe.
4;Pleased;I received the tea a lot quicker than I thought I would. I will be ordering it again because it is very good tea.
5;Organic goodness for the furry ones;I have been feeding my cats Newman's Own Organics Organic Beef and Liver for years now and their health is the better for it.  Whenever I go to the vet and mention that I'm feeding them this they have nothing but good things to say.
5;Kids love Sleepytime iced tea;I make my own iced tea with Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea.  My kids love it, it keeps us all more calm and peaceful, and I add my own sugar so it is not overloaded with it.
5;Greenies are great....albiet Xpensive;All greenies are overpriced.  But, since my critters love 'em so, I watch the price and get a bunch when it drops to a more reasonable level.
2;They taste okay...too chewy;These gummy centipedes tastes good, except for the red and white. I'm really concerned at how much it taste like soap.
5;Great Product;This candy is absolutely wonderful. Just like I remember from when I was a kid.
2;Smelly Box;Total disaster.  I ordered two boxes of Land O' Lakes creamers and both boxes contained many erupted creamers.
1;EAT REAL PASTA AND RUN 5 MILES- MUCH LESS TORTURE THAN EATING THESE;I read about these forever on Hungry-Girl.com and I've always wanted to try them, they rave and rave and rave about them.
5;Best stuff to get you awake fast w/o the jitters!;Ok seriously, this is the best product I have found that really wakes you up, doesn't make you jittery, and doesn't make you crash.  Typically every morning I just have a pop in the morning and that's fine, but on mornings when I am dragging, this is what I drink and it wakes you up fast and makes you feel great!  I subscribe and save to this so I always have some at my desk at work.
5;Delicious and relatively low calorie;Only 160 calories, tons of fiber, and only need to add 2/3 cup of water and microwave for 1:35.  Very filling.
4;Somewhat Expensive;My doggy loves these treats, but cannot find them any longer in the pet store I usually shop in this type of container.  These were rather expensive for the size compared to the ones I bought at the pet store.
1;SPARKLING DRAIN CLEANER;This stuff is terrible! It tastes like a homemade fortified wine. We served it at a dinner party of ten and nobody liked it whatsoever.
5;Awesome!;Pros:<br />Dog will do anything for this treat.<br />Doesn't smell as bad as many other treats.
5;Time for tea!;This tea is lovely for a refreshing iced tea, a comforting hot tea or mixed into a light Sangria.  'Hard to find, but worth the effort.
4;Great Tasting and Works fairly well;I like this flavor the best. It works for me but not for my gf, although she isn't affected by caffine at all.
5;Jet Fuel;This is fantastic coffee..
5;Mareblu;Excellent product.  A healthy good tasting choice for snack time.
5;If you have a chubby dog...;my geriatric beagle mix would eat herself into a coma if I didn't watch her like a hawk, so I was concerned that each pocket was 29 calories (which is a lot for a treat) so since she only has one small pill twice a day, I cut the pocket in half and squish the pill in it.  15 calories is still pretty steep, but it gets the job done for half the calories anyway.
5;Cherry Poo;I love the Fruit & Nut Food bars from Larabar.<br /><br />They are a healthy snack, and unlike many other fruit flavored bars, you can actually taste the dead fruit.
5;Good as I expected;I cooked the rice today, and it is good as I expected. The minor problem is that the zipper on the bag is not of high-quality.
4;Very tasty and healthy, but could be more in box;"I really enjoy this cereal, appreciate its health benefits, and have an Amazon ""subscription"" for it.  I also enjoy the ""no sugar added"" Familia Muesli."
5;thank you dr lucy!;these are so great for a GF kid (or adult..
4;Orange Marzipan Review;Pleasing Orange flavor in a nice marzipan covered in rich dark chocolate.  The orange flavor is not overpowering and gives a pleasant taste to the filling.
1;Itchy and irritating - strong allergic reaction;I have used the regular Degree anti-perspirant without any problems. I bought the new Degree Silver Ion and after the first I experienced the same as the previous reviewers.
4;Great nutritional profile, tastes better than the vanilla variety;These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.
5;Delicious!;"These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious!  The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them.  I don't know if they're quite ""gooey"" as the label claims, but they are quite good."
5;Homemade muesli;I use Bob'sj Red Mill oatmeal to make my own muesli. Store bought has way too much sugar so I make it myself.
5;Great! Love this!;I am really happy with this AeroGarden. Plants grow fast, and are delicious.
2;On the strong side;The flavors of these are a bit on the strong side. Wish I hadn't bought so many.
2;Not Great.;This coffee isn't worth the extra money.  It's no better than any low cost Keurig Cups.
3;doesn't taste like hazelnut;While it didn't taste like hazelnut at all to me, I like this product. I just mixed it in with the regular unflavored.
1;totally bland, no aroma, should not have trusted high ratings;My wife and I are Kona coffee lovers, Kona coffee with no cream no sugar, just that strong morning fresh coffee aroma and taste. I read some of the high ratings and ordered this coffee instead of Hawaii Roasters 100% Kona coffee, our normal Kona coffee.
5;Legal Crack;What negative thing could I possibly say about these?<br />Oh yes..
5;haven't tried yet;in response to the son not liking the milk, i recently had a delicious almond chai milk made at a new raw restaurant in seattle, called &#34
5;Great Product;Dehydrated beans are SO much better than canned.  Very easy to use.
5;Not just for cooking...;I also use this (not the same container) for a daily moisturizer. It is wonderful.
3;Not a substitute for Peach Rings;I love the gummi peach rings that you can find in most grocery stores, and thought that this was the same thing. It's not.
4;Three out of Three Dogs plus one Cat love these;I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.
3;Good, but just a bit too sweet for my tastes;I generally like anything coffee related so I thought I'd give these a try.  It does make a fairly generous amount of iced coffee, but the whole thing was just a bit too sweet for me.
4;A great addition to my daughters lunch;My daughter switched to soy milk about 2 years ago for no other reason than she prefers the taste.  For drinking at home we buy the brand she prefers, but they don't carry individual sizes so we had been looking for something she'd like.
5;yummy gummies;These are the most flavorful gummy bears I have ever eaten.  They had a great texture too.
4;Soda Juice;In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet..
5;The Best Cookies and The Best Service.;My order of Ginger Snaps are always delivered on time without broken cookies in the box, this I truly appreciate.<br />I also like the reasonably priced product plus the inexpensive shipping.
2;There's another way;I tried this since I love bacon everything. I found it to have this odd after taste that gets worse every time you eat more of it.
2;Too much clove!;There is nothing but a strong clove flavor to this tea.  I have had better chai teas with more subtle flavoring.
5;Delicious!;Excellent Peppermint tea - can't beat the price - would pay quite a bit more on store shelves..
5;Great Taste;This is very good coffee. There is no bitter after taste, the aroma is excellent and for the price it comes highly recommended.
5;Very refreshing!;Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.
5;Great cup of coffee;A really good cup of coffee..
4;Good Stuff;I am a health food nut and in general don't like artificial food.  Walden Farms succeeded in making an almost all natural, good tasting substitute for a sometimes high-calorie food, your salad dressing.
5;love it;Great taste,<br />I've used it in my smoothies, salads, and mixed in with yogurt and fruits sometimes too =]<br />It tastes mildly nutty, but MILDLY
5;Green Tea and Chocolate together is real good!!!;I am a big green tea freak and also totally dig chocolate. So when I saw this ish at the Fancy Food Show, I was intrigued.
1;The price doubled!;I bought this product not that many months ago and loved it BUT no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price! I bought it for $10 originally. Will buy another brand.
4;Excellent coffee, bad k-cups;The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.
5;bays english muffins;These english muffins, to me, are by far the best tasting. They toast crisp on the crust, while retaining good texture and pockets for butter.
1;BUYER BEWARE - DON'T BUY FROM NUTRICITY!!!;If I could put zero stars I would!<br /><br />I purchased two 64-fl oz containers of pure maple syrup from Nutricity through Amazon. The product was fine.
5;OMG--surpasses chips, crisps, crackers;I am on very low carbohydrate diet to control diabetes, triglycerides, and lose some excess body fat (very successful at 65 pounds lost), but the salty crisp snack other than pork rinds has escaped me until now.  At 2 gm carbs, even 60 mg sodium per packet of just seaweed, sesame oil, and sea salt.
4;Great booster;I have used it for few weeks during my training for the next marathon. It has taste that I like (banana-strawberry) and if you take it with enough water before, between sips, and after you will have the energy to continue.
5;Capsuls for Nespresso coffee machine;Just filled a few of the capsules yesterday with my own coffee.  It was a little messy but used the capsules this morning and they worked just fine.
5;Pure Instant Energy;Excellent product, it helps me a lot in my cycling long trainings or demanding cycling events. Normally I take one gel before my training or event, and one every 45 minutes.
5;A great smooth flavor;Russian Caravan is by far my favorite style of tea. For a long time it was very hard to find and I went to great lengths to procure every brand I could find.
5;BEST HYGRADE CATNIP & LOT'S OF IT!;My Kitties LOVE the stuff.<br /><br />The HUGE amount I got for such a CHEAP Price was amazing.
4;Good O shaped cereal for kids;My son loves these, thank goodness.  They hold up well in soymilk for ceral in the morning and also hold up well in snack bags.
5;Amazing Food!;After doing my research (before we got our kittens) I ended up with this brand. I feed my family good food, why not my animals? Viola occasionally has stinky poo, but not too often for it to be a problem.
5;This candy is so good!!;Everytime I've given this candy as a gift, the recipient raves about it!  They always ask me where I got it and says how good it is.  It makes a wonderful birthday gift, thank you gift, etc.
1;Poor Quality;Unfortunately, I believed that by looking at the packaging, I was getting the OLD style gum, which has a lesser chance of sticking to the paper when carried in my pocket for a few days, than the new cheap gum.  I loose more gum now because it sticks to the paper after I've carried it in my pocket for a few days.
5;Time changes but quality remains high;Today food prices increase and quantity, quality decrases. This product in its format is excellent if you have the right type of water (unfluridated).
5;I use this mixed with dry food;I divide these between my dogs, so they only get a little at a time and I water it down to make a kind of gravy. But they absolutely freaking LOVE this stuff.
1;Expensive!!;I am continually amazed at how much pet stores and retailers selling pet supplies charge for basic stuff.  Feline Pine is no exception.
3;Nothing crazy;Besides the fact that this coffee is really dark and bitter there is nothing more to say about it.  Great price though and I wanted to try it out so it's not bad.
3;Works okay;The taste does not last long but it is a small piece of gum. It does wipe out any lingering tastes such as onions, garlic or coffee.
5;Delicious;Cocoa Beach is great! Pretty good for you, especially compared to other granolas, and absolutely delicious. I could probably eat it every day.
5;So good.;I've purchased this product numerous times at my local grocery stores, and normally it runs about $4 a box. That is a bit pricey for a sauce packet and some cheap noodles, but it is so convenient and tasty that I continued to purchase it until they stopped selling it.
4;Very good biscotti;I'm spoiled with biscotti. We have a great local company that makes lots of flavors and it's my favorite biscotti.
2;Too Much Cumin;I thought I tried something different rather than just plain old potato chips.  The cumin flavor was very strong in one bag while another bag was light in cumin (and better for my taste buds).
5;sweet awesome coconut oil;i have tried a few different coconut oils.  i tried this one after a friend recommended it to me.
5;Satisfied Pickler;I was very pleased with my order.  It arrived in prompt manner and was fresh and perfect for all my pickling needs.
3;Good but oil of bergamot overrides black tea flavor;Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.
5;YUM.;Having this sauce in my house is like having a Thai restaurant in my kitchen. The sauce has the right balance of peanut decadence and chili spice.
5;Excellent cookies.;These cookies are delicious and remind me of Christmas.  However, they do not ship all that well.
5;Good eats;Love these Tortilla chips with chili. Great for my low carb diet, and all my thin friends love them , too.
5;They're the Best;I've tried all of the original flavors and enjoy them all.  They are wonderfully flavored, different than the norm, and pretty healthy.
5;Awesome;A little on the salty side but I like it that way..
5;Great flavor for snacking;"The Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds taste great and are a nice healthy option for a snack. The flavor is bold, but not overpowering or ""hot."
1;Tasted so bad couldn't even use it;I purchased this color along with the gold and silver and all that i can say is that it doesn't taste like it should edible. I threw all of it out and I was very dispointed that I wasted my money and time with this product.
1;Cadet Beef Tendons Canine Treats Not as Depicted!!;First, I waited for over two weeks to get what appeared to be a good alternative to the chicken sticks that my Shih Tzus love. Imagine my disgust when I opened the box of Cadet Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats and found black bugs in the bag and in the packing box.
3;nice but could be improved;Being a guy that chews gum everyday i was looking for a healthier alternative to my usual ''dentyne ice'' those small rectangular hard pieces of gum.  I found spry and thought i hit the jackpot.
5;Great Substitute for Discontinued Item;My cats are crazy for the Whisker Lickin's Crunch Lovers Salmon treats by Purina. I order them by the case and just found out when I tried to reorder that it has been discontinued.
5;Excellent product;
5;BAM - Emerils Big Easy Bold K-Cups;I love my Keurig brewer, but was torn that Starbucks and Seatle's Best was not available. When I found Emeril's, I was curious at first and loved it immediately.
5;Great tasting cake for an adult palate;I heard about these cakes from the Michael Portillo train journeys through England series.  I was surprised that I could order them through Amazon and am not disappointed.
4;My picky dog enjoys eating it;My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.
5;excellent product;This is a nice blend of different nut flavors
5;Really Good!;I ordered this to display at my 60th birthdy party. People was amazed at the type of candy that was back in the day.
5;A gift from the heavens!;Oh man, did Baumer Foods ever blast this one out of the park!<br /><br />This stuff is so good I even wrote their president a letter to let him know<br />just how happy he's made me. LOL<br /><br />I have been addicted to Crystal Hot Sauce for 20 years, and this new addition<br />is a welcome compliment to their regular sauce, that IMO is much more flavorful,<br />and less vinegary, than all the other Louisiana style sauces.
5;They love them!;The dogs love them and, more importantly, they spend some time chewing them! They are not gone in ten minutes flat. Also easy to store and dont leave a mess.
1;Totally vile;I was shocked by how bad this tasted. Wow.
5;Love this tea;This is the best Camomile tea for Keurig.  We have a cup every night.
5;Simply delicious and very satisfying!;I needed to cut back on my sugar intake and increase my protein consumption.  I came across the thinkThin bars at the store one night and bought one chunky peanut butter and one brownie crunch.
5;My husband takes them to work every day;After my husband tried these chips (BBQ flavor) at a lunch meeting he couldn't stop talking about them.  We found them at a local grocery store - but they were on the expensive side.
1;Do not order this if it has to be shipped long distances!;I received this item in a box with other that were packaged well. This item was just thrown into the bottom of the box without any bubble wrap or popcorn to keep it from moving around.
1;Absolute disaster;Product arrived as a congealed mass. Not a single truffle survived intact during shipping.
5;lodi gayle;I LOVE THIS TEA.  I WISH STASH STILL HAD THIS IN TEA BAGS.
5;Tastes so great even for adults!;These are the first finger snacks I gave my 8-month old, whom was already on solids at 5 months though. I found them originally at my local Target.
5;Yummy Dark Chocolate;Even my kids like this. They are always asking for hot cocoa.
5;My spoiled dogs love them;I haven't used them long enough to see a visible difference but my 4 Chihuahuas seem to like them. This is the perfect size for a dog 5-10lbs.
1;Clogs my coffee maker;These are TERRIBLE!!!!!!  The coffee tastes fine when they work.  More than half the time they clogged up my Keurig and I had to clean the whole machine to get it to work again.
5;Healthy cats and kittens!;My cats were having so many digestive issues with other dry cat food. Let's just say the kitty litter was a lot messier than I wanted to clean up.
1;Not the best;I was forced to look for a new hazelnut extract when the shop i usually go to was out of Watkins brand extract.  Considering the price and the organic factor, I thought it might be a good substitute.
3;Cat loved it, but it only lasted two weeks;I got this product specifically because Kong has a great reputation for durable dog toys. I thought their cat toys would be durable.
5;Roland Tempura Batter Mix;In my opinion this is the best tempura batter I have used. The flavor enhances whatever you are deep frying.
1;Hope you like milk and sugar and no coffee;These are only for people would want a little coffee with their cream and sugar. Will not purchase these again and Sorry I bought them.
5;My favorite soda!!!;This is the BEST vanilla cream soda I have tasted!!! (And I have had LOTS..
5;Just like always;great, taste like always and is as good as ever.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice, wonderful, awesome.
5;love this but not here;I love the pina colada sobe drink. it's like a virgin pina colada and is best served cold from the fridge.
1;thanks for your review;I was about to order this product until I read the reviews, which reflect my sentiment EXACTLY! I called the 800 number on the side of the can. The lady who answered was very kind and sent me a coupon for some cheese.
4;Alone it tastes very chemically;Alone this product tastes very chemically but if you add other food to it it's much better tasting. I made a really good tasting fried rice that took no time in making.
5;Meat Lover!;I have tried other companies & found them way more expensive!<br />Entrees meat was phenomenal!  They shipped earlier than they<br />indicated & the packaging was easy.  Great choice.
5;Tasty!;I purchased this item out of curiosity..
4;Excellent Product;I was excited about these lollipops.  Just so you know when ordering, their taste is delicious, but they are uneven in size.
5;Canned cat food;Cats seem to love this.  Looks and smells like chicken people would eat.
5;Delicous;Yummy product. I eat this everyday at school as an afternoon snack.
1;Different;I'm so glad you emailed.  I have been trying to find a way to communicate to you my total disappointment.
4;Better than I expected!;I bought these by accident, but I'm glad that I did. I intended to buy the Southern Sweet Tea flavor, but clicked on the wrong product (I was shopping by image, saw the little ice symbol, and didn't even notice I ordered the wrong thing until it arrived).
5;Favorite Of The Keurig Coffee K-cups;This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..
1;Very poor quality;
5;Best tasting oil;"""Product arrived quickly, packaged well. Love the taste- Fresh, clean."
3;Good (but not great) flavor from a Smaller Crouton;Good flavor from a smaller crouton.<br /><br />I can't find any flaws - smaller size, good crunch and some real taste.
5;Absolutely deliciious tea;Not much to say.  This is just the best breakfast tea available.
4;Finally!  the REAL TEXTURE & TASTE of Black Licorice;Wow, I'm eating this new amazing licorice as I write this review.  The package arrived not 5 minutes ago and I admit I was  skeptical.
5;Best English Tea I've found in the USA;I first tried quality English tea when we spent a month in Oxford visiting a friend and I've been trying to find good tea ever since.  This is VERY much better than any other tea that I've tried.
3;kids gum;to me the flavor does not last that long.  it is good that kids get tattoos from the gum rappers.
3;Okay taste, questionable energy.;I drank the entire can in one sitting, but didn't feel any sort of boost in energy. I'm not sure what the effects were, but the taste was decent.
5;One of the best!;This is by far not only one of the best gluten free pastas I've had , but one of the best pastas period.  Meaning I would pick this over most glutenous pastas.
5;Great Snack;I am a big fan of the Nature Valley granola bars so I was anxious to try these.  I have to say I have a new favorite!  The granola bars are very hard and brittle, I end of with little bits all over me when I finish one.
5;Made a Good Gift for Tea Lovers;We ordered this for a gift but have not seen it or tasted it ourselves.  Bought this for my Mother-in-law for Mother's Day with the hope that she would like it.
2;Disappointed;We have ordered this coffee on several occasions and have been happy with the it.  The most recent order seemed lacking in quality.
2;Gluten-free mac n cheese;My son did not like this very much. It was hard being diagnosed just before 12 years old when he hit puberty it set in.
5;Carrot Cake;I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.
5;GREAT TASTE, NOT SO GREAT PRICE;Cheaper at Target. $14.
5;Better than Starbuck's!!!;This coffee is delicious!  Blend 2 oz. of espresso and ice and any kind of syrup flavoring you like and it's way better than Starbucks.
2;My dog vomits after eating this food;My dog is allergic and my vet suggested to change its food. After reading the ingredients of this product, I thought it would be a good option.
4;We need more;These are just the size the description states- snack size.  Ours came from the 3-in-one (which we LOVE).
5;This is great breakfast syrup;We honestly were pleasantly surprised when we used this syrup for our pancakes a couple weeks ago.  It was far superior to the sugar free syrups we have tried in the past.
1;Overpriced;This is a great product. My cat loves it but I can buy a 6.
5;These are the best!;I love these bars and run out of them quickly. I don't feel guilty about this snack - they are tasty yet healthy.
5;Refreshing;This is the best water out there. It is refreshing, delicious and contains zero calories and nothing artificial.
5;Great stuff!;I frequently order this milk by the case.  It's very convenient to always have milk on hand.
2;Not really an Earl Grey tea;This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.
5;Awesome!;Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder.
1;What a disappointment.;"Based on the favorable reviews I decided to give this a try.  The name may be ""instant espresso"", but really it is just an odd tasting instant coffee."
5;Pecan Review;I bought this product because someone gave it to me last Christmas, and I found the pecans to be excellent. I also wanted to compare them to a locally mad glazed pecan product.
5;The best product;I like this product very much.It has delicious taste and it's very good for you, because has no artificual ingrediantes.
3;Tastes like medicine, but decent. Peanut butter ones are the best.;I probably just don't like macarons to begin with. The candy colored ones tasted like bitter medicine but looked very well prepared.
5;Very good;Sonny's is a restauarant chain in the south. They have fantastic bar-b-que.
5;Cat loves the flavor;Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day.
5;Awesome Popcorn;Orville's is the best microwave popcorn you can buy..
5;Snap into a Slim Jim they're great;They are great.  Grab a couple for your pocket for a road trip.
5;Amish Country Lady Finger Popcorn - 2lb.;My wife says that I can cook two things - omelettes and popcorn..
5;Cottie loves this cat food;(ASIN: B0018Z4H1Y
5;Light flavored tea;"I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps ""prepare"" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored."
5;Delicious!;I'm all for easy to make adult beverages, and this fits the bill.  The perfect amount of sweet, and the mint flavor is divine.
4;Low carb, spicy snack sticks;I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.
5;Best Gluten Free Pasta!;Finally a gluten free pasta that tastes great.  It cooks just like regular pasta.
4;Tasty sauce, great on a veggie burger;I admit I don't often visit Taco Bell. However, I have enjoyed their bean burritos in the past, as I am a vegetarian and I appreciate that they offer several items on the value menu that I can eat.
4;Good, but not quite my taste;To be fair, this was my first attempt at home brewing.  With that in mind:<br /><br />I thought this was a well thought out kit, and the instructions were easy to follow.
5;Can't live Without!!!!!;I discovered this tea at my local grocery a few years back when I was coming down with a cold.  The store discontinued it and now I have it on auto ship with Amazon.
4;Great Tasting Coffee;I have been drinking Folgers Colombian coffee since I first moved to the US over 10 years ago.  I tried some of the other mass-produced coffees first but couldn't find one that I liked.
4;pop and tart;In the crowded field of orange soda pop beverages, a relatively new product needs a niche to succeed.  Izze's schtick is 70% fruit juice, no sugar added.
5;Best dog treats ever.;My dogs love these treats.  Originally found them at Petsmart but they don't carry them anymore.
5;Review of the product, not Amazon;I have not purchased this from Amazon, though if the delivery is the same as the other experiences I've had in the past decade or so, I'm sure it is fine.<br /><br />I have purchased these in my local grocery store, and they're fantastic.
5;The best chai tea on the market;I've tried many others but this is by far the best chai tea out there.  The spices in this one are amazing and I can't stop drinking the tea.
4;My dogs like them, but they STINK!;We got the salmon and the peanut butter flavors for our puppies, and they go crazy for them. They were really hard to potty train, but these were small and healthy enough that we were able to give them to our dogs every time they pottied outside.
5;Best rub;This rub is so good I'm going to texas to thank mr henry in person..
5;My all time favorite cereal!;After my grocery store stopped carrying these a few years back, I was crushed.  It is my all-time favorite cereal and I adore it.
1;Failed;"Tried this mix in a <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great!;I grew up in Ukraine and love buckwheat. I used to go to a Russian store to buy their buckwheat in bulk, but it did not even get close to the quality of Bob's organic buckwheat.
1;Chalky abominations;Chalky, unpleasant disks that come in crappy synthetic flavors. That's all that needs to be said.
5;Terrific, new part of my daily routine;One of the best shakes ever. If you're looking to break the frappacino habit for something a bit healthier.
5;all my dogs love it;Some of my dogs are finicky and won't eat most canned dog foods, but they all love this food. It makes a great treat or topper for kibble, and is thick enough to hide pills.
5;We love this product;We love the way our Lhasa Apso smells after her oatmeal bath.  We've tried other products and always go back to this one.
4;San Francisco Bay coffee,French Roast;Another great coffee from San Francisco Bay. This roast,like their Fog Chaser, are great first morning cup of coffee.
2;No so Good;I bought these with the hopes that it would increase my milk production.  While it did increase my production just a little bit, it left my breast milk with a strange odor.
5;Great product for healthy and on the go!;I really like this product.  Easy to store (no fridge needed) and easy to make (1.
4;Quick, Easy & Delicious!;I picked up several of these on clearance at a local store. They've been sitting in my pantry for a couple months now, but last night my daughter asked if she could use one to make chocolate covered strawberries.
5;Best bar ever!;The cashew cookie bar is one of the best bars i have ever eaten, especially when you look at the ingredients. It is all natural with no preservatives.
5;One Year Old Son Loves these! @quakeroats;This morning I gave my son a quaker oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing.
5;Like Candy;If you love the jalapeno flavor, but don't want your tongue scorched, these are for you.  I love the jalapeno flavor, and can eat these like candy.
5;great popcorn;We like this popcorn for its taste and texture.  Although it is black, it pops up whiter than other popcorns, and is more crispy IMO.
1;Awful;I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed.
1;Item arrived damaged;I just received the plant.  I paid extra for a quick delivery to secure the plant's condition.
5;Currently the Best;Ever since Aunt Jemima discontinued their buckwheat pancake mix I have been searching for an acceptable replacement.  This is it!  This tastes as good as AJ's and its gluten free to boot.
5;Love it;Oatmeal is great. Instant oatmeal is conveniently great.
2;I like that it is vegan, but hate that it has a boring flavor;"I tried the Rocky Road flavor and while it is not awful, it is nothing to rave over.  When something is described as a ""sinfully healthy snack"", I expect it to taste magical and leave me in awe that it only has 140 calories."
3;Not bad;"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with."
5;Delicious;Sure they are more like instant coffee than freshly ground, and there may even be some artificial sweeteners in there, but the truth is, they're delicious. And for those of you who don't want to put these things in your body, feel free to send them to me.
5;Love this Flavor;I just ordered and received this flavor of K-cups.  It has become my favorite and will be reordering again soon.
5;Pop Easy!;So easy to make popcorn with these everything-in-on portion packs.  All you do is load your popcorn machine with the premeasured amount of popcorn & flavored oil and you are good to go.
5;Love this coffee!;I love this coffee! I drink about 2-4 cups a day. I used to be a Starbucks Dark Roast fan but Lavazza's won me over! I'm not a connoisseur, but I use a drip coffee maker and it tastes great.
5;Excellent;The Chai Latte is excellent!  So happy this is available for the Keurig.  I will continue to purchase this product.
4;Great Gluten-free Cookies;These cookies are excellent.  Anyone would enjoy eating them and my granddaughters, who both have Celiac, loved them.
5;We love it!;My family loves this stuff- it's sooo good! (It is very flavorful w/ a slightly nutty taste) I used to buy it all the time at our local grocery store, but we moved to another state and no one sells it here. I had to resort to buying it on-line because we simply cannot live without it.
5;Great tea! But $7 for shipping?;Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags.
5;wish I'd started using it 5 years ago;I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.
5;BIRDS CUSTARD POWDER-WONDERFUL;"I HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT UNTIL I SAW IT USED IN CHEESECAKE ON ""NIGELLA FEASTS""  ON THE FOOD NETWORK.  IT CAME PROMPTLY AND CORRECTLY."
5;So rich and tasty!;This is one good way to treat yourself for cold winter weather. It is absolutely yummy and so rich! Only 80 calories and 25 fat per envelope too.
2;not great;The flavor is not that great.  I would prefer something with a little more flavor,tastes like cheap coffee.
1;Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!;Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.
1;poor packaging;the coffee was all loose inside the box.  Don't know what happened, but unable to use.
1;Gevalia Morning Disappointment;I have never written a negative review but I just had to comment about this product. It is absolutely the worst cup of coffee I have ever tasted.
5;Biggest, best Beef Jerky ever!;This is such a delicious bag of Peppered Beef Jerky. I love having a big bag of it to snack on whenever I feel like it.
5;Great Gluten Free Cookies;My daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has Celiac loves these cookies. Have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on Amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family.
5;Probably the best Petite Beurre biscuits on the market;These are the best of the many petite beurre biscuits that are on the market from various vendors.  Maybe it's the french butter, maybe it is the flour, but regardless, these are the best.
5;my family loves this;I love the convenience of having these shipped to the door.  My family loves the product.
5;Very Soft Yummy Cookies;I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to Quaker considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories.
4;Treats;My dog with the food allergies didn't care for these. He didn't want to eat them because they were rather hard.
4;Be kind to Kind;Great product at a great price.  These bars are great snacks in between meals.
5;Delicious cereal...;My little boy loves this cereal although he loves mainly peaches. Taste is very good and nutritious!<br />We try different fruit but I think this is the best one among them.
4;Very Good;"This is one of the best ""ready-to-eat"" products from Kitchens of India. Like all of them however, I still recommend combining it with something starchy like rice/naan/potato/etc."
5;We Both Love It;My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles.
5;Delicious;I love stroopwafels, but have a hard time finding a store that sells them where I live.  I ordered these when I was really craving them, and they are delicious--nice crispy cookie with good chewy caramel filling that melts down perfectly with the steam of some hot tea.
5;iam german and this is the best!;since living here in the states, christmas season has always been hard for me because i miss all the good things like gingerbread and of course the gluehwein..
5;Homey flavor;Delicious, warming, nourishing tea for a chilly day. This product is a bagged mixture of green tea and little bits of toasted rice.
5;Good tea;Just what I was looking for. A black tea that had a hint of peach and caffeine!  Just enough flavor to give a hint but not overwhelm.
5;Great Pretzels!;Love these pretzels, I actuallly think they have better flavor than regular pretzels.  And my kids eat them up too.
4;Chicken and Veal what a meal;Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors.
5;No more upset stomach and better health for our papillon;After switching from puppy to adult food our 8 lb. female papillon would often vomit at least once a day.
4;Great cookies;Great taste and go well with coffee.  They are wrapped into two packs inside the box, which is useful for snacks for the kids.
4;Great Red Tea;This red tea is really great. Not fancy packaging, but the flavor and value is great.
5;sees candy is the best;i was amazed at how well the canndies came and they made it look really nice on the package. the candy was great and tasted really well.
5;Yummy, fresh pork rinds!;I love it, less than two minutes in the microwave and you have hot, crispy and fresh (key here..
5;One of thee best tasting Coffee's I've ever had...You can believe in me Mr. Bean;Atten: All you Foldgers coffee drinkers out there this coffee is not for you it is way way out of your league..
5;Love this sauce!;I picked up a jar of this sauce randomly the other week while at the grocery store, having never heard of Dave's products at all. SO happy I gave this a try! This sauce is so yummy, it's a little thick in the jar but works well with pasta.
4;Delicious--very fruity;This tea is very good.  I'm a religious green tea drinker, so I decided to branch out and try this fruity variety.
5;Diet Orange Delight;This soda has the most marvelous orange flavor with no poisonous colorings or additives of any kind and the water  is triple filtered.It is also clean tasting with a fine quenching pull in its after taste.
5;Why is this so expensive on Amazon?;I go to the .99c stores in my neighborhood in NYC and this stuff is $1.
5;Cannot Tell There Are Veggies;The cynic in me wants to know how I know they are not lying about the veggie content. LOL!  But, seriously, I made this for lunch and it tasted just like regular Macaroni & Cheese from the famous blue box.
5;love it!!!;My dog thinks it is crack! He is crazy over these teenie greeinies. Arived on time and cheeper than the store for sure.
5;Great for training;These are fantastic training treats. Great to take on walks, perfect size.
5;Really, really good!!;I eat one of these bars every day for breakfast.  They are that good.
5;customer beware! you'll never buy another popcorn!;as a long time popcorn fanatic, i was excited to try tiny but mighty and i'm so happy i did. it is the most delicious popcorn i have ever tried.
5;Yummy Ginger Cookies;Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.
5;Much Better than Kelloggs and Fiber One!;These are great.  Loved em.
5;Best soup ever.;Very good soup, light and creamy. Added curry gives just right spice to the  taste.
2;Not what expected;I had high hopes for the 25 different Crazy Cup Sampler, but was sorely disappointed.  I received just 11 different varieties and as many as 6 of 3 kinds.
3;Light Tasting Coffee for the Light Drinker, NOT for Your Regular Coffee Drinker;As a heavy coffee drinker (born and raised in Seattle, it's in our blood) I've become..
5;Nothing like Zesty popcorn;Zesty brings out the zest in popcorn. Plain popcorn in dull and tastes like nothing in your mouth.
5;My puppy loves these;My beagle puppy loves these treats. He doesn't particularly cares for his crate but he goes right in it when he comes from outside because he knows he is going to get this treat.
1;"This is coconut ""water"" not ""juice"".";I misread the label.  I was looking for real juice - not some water-down passion fruit flavoring.
5;Authentic flavor;I first tried chai tea when I was in Nepal about 9 years ago and this is the only chai that I have found that comes close to the chai I had there.  The others I've tried have all been to heavy on one spice or another and this blend is perfect.
5;Awesome little garden! It's so much fun to watch it grow :-);I got my Aerogarden back in December, 2006. I have been seeing it sprout very well from when I first started using it December 18th to be exact.
4;Great for Snack Attack!;"I choose to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet because I have multiple sclerosis.  This product enables me to have my ""sweets"" without the consequences."
5;More popular than puffs in our house!;We love love love the Baby Mum-mums. My son (9 months) bites into them and cracks them off the way an adult would bite into a candy bar.
5;Works, economical alternative to other 'diet' teas;This stuff works. As reported by real doctors, do not use this all the time, only when needed.
4;Really good treats for training;I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.
3;Organic but Dry;The ground coffee comes in a 3 pack and in the first shipment it was leaking from the bags into the shipping box.  It was due to the packaging by the Canano Island manufacturer.
5;Excellent;This diet ginger ale syrup mix is great.  As good as any other ginger ale's out there and a much cheaper way to get it.
1;Great Packaging, Horrible Taste,  YUCK!!!;I was so excited for this to arrive because I LOVE Orgain drinks and this has two benefits over Orgain.  The first benefit is the drink is larger in size (15.
5;Nothing like it.........the best ever!;My wife bought a candy bar made by Seitenbacher at our local store. She said it was great, and I looked it up on Amazon.
5;Good baking cups.;I had never used these baking cups before, but due to the price I figured I would give them a try.  I was a little worried that they wouldn't fit my mini cupcake pan because of one of the other reviews, but they fit the pan fine.
4;Didn't relieve my PMS but it did get rid of my migraines!;I've been suffering from mentrual migraines for years. Drinking water, taking the right vitamins, and exercising regularly reduced the frequency and the intensity of the migraine but I would still get them.
5;Great tasting medium roast, slight hint of chocolate;Years ago I hated coffee, now I'm an addict. But I can't drink any of it black.
5;A fast-track ride on the sugarland express!!;Okay, they are loaded with sugar, but I rather like a little sugar with my fiber.<br /><br />Having been raised on the typical late 60s/early 70s diet of sugar, grease and salt, I'm unable to choke down a bowl of tree bark and seaweed at 0-dark-thirty.
5;Grant Snack Bars - Highly Recommended;"These Nature Valley ""Crunchy Granola Bars, Oats 'n Honey"" are a tasty mid-afternoon snack and are filling enough to hold me over until dinner. These are, as the name suggests, very crunchy and can be a little messy (crumbs) when eating."
1;Mocha K-Cup;A little too sweet for us. However we had no problem swapping it to a friend for some coffee we enjoyed much more.
5;Hot apple cider;You get alot for your money. When you have a minute to sit back and relax and enjoy a nice hot apple cider.
3;Feline hits and misses...;Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats by Nature's Variety, 4-Ounce Package<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />They're oddly-shaped, greyish-beige, roughly circular pucks about the size of a modern dollar piece around and maybe half an inch thick, that look so thoroughly unappetizing that I immediately gave up all thought of trying a piece of one and reporting on the taste for the sake of art.
5;Great Product;not sure how people are experiencing failures with the sprayer because i havent yet and have used it 3 years running.  Sometimes it takes multiple applications to rid of all the bugs but it works great.
5;Best Vanilla Beans ever;I love these vanilla beans.  Very soft and full of vanilla specks, fragrant and flavorful!  The ones in the grocery store are hard, stale and EXPENSIVE!  I made home made vanilla extract and it is delicious in all my recipes!  Try it!I  [.
5;Pat O'Brien's Hurricane Mix;The mix was enough to make about 10, 20 oz hurricanes.  The instructions were good and the drink turned out very tasty and was almost as easy to make as buying a hurricane at Pat O'Briens.
5;More than for taste or digestion aid  . . .;I have used this tea for years to help whenever I have had digestive problems.  Besides it's value as a great drink - it also has value for ailments.
4;Does what it is intended to do!;5-hour energy does what is promised.  If you are looking for the nervous, jittery, and overall anxious feeling, this is not the drink.
5;Yummy!;I first found these in a neighborhood store. Now I can't get enough.
5;Picky cats!;The only treats my cats will eat.  They love them!  Wish amazon had more favors since there are so many out there.
5;another great treat and it really works...;My one aussie was starting to get a tartar build-up on her teeth when I found this product.  They love them and I can notice a difference in my girls teeth.
2;Disappointed.;I purchased this tea to make iced tea and found it to be extremely weak in comparison to similar teas from other brands.  My recipe calls for 12 teaspoons of tea.
5;Works like a charm!;How cool is it that you can actually reuse your k-cups!?  These disposable lids work perfectly and fit on the top of the cleaned k-cups.  I noticed no leakage.
2;As of 12/09 this is NOT Gluten-Free;I contacted Bob's Red Mill by telephone after noticing that the packaging no longer shows Gluten Free. I was told the buckwheat is sourced from one company, and that enough contamination has started occuring that Bob's Red Mill Creamy Buckwheat can NO LONGER be considered Gluten-Free.
5;Best Licorice Spice Tea!;Licorice Spice is my most favorite daily tea flavor. Earl Grey is what I take in the winter instead of coffee.
5;Crack for Kitties;Our cats just love this stuff.  They eat the Ultra Premium dry food and Ocean Fish canned food.
5;No, it's not exactly like traditional gochujang, still great though;Some people are docking stars because it's not exactly like the thicker traditional korean pepper paste but that's a bit unfair. It's sweeter and slightly tangy but still delicious.
5;My bully loves this food!;My English Bulldog loves this food.  He thought it was treats when we were switching him off of Eukanuba.
4;it really works!!;I'd been using the Benecol chews for several months, planning on getting a cholesterol test, to see if they helped.  Then they went out of stock for several months & I tried another product that I didn't like as well.
4;Not 11 packets, but only one and it is damn good;When I purchased this product I thought I was getting 11 packets since quantity said 11 and picture had 6 packets in them. The 11 is actually the number of biscuits inside the packet.
5;Great Tea!;I drink about 4-5 cups of this tea everyday.  I suffer with bacterial infections and have read that this product helps keep everything balanced.
5;All four dogs love these;I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is!  These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls.  We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.
5;Nestle Needs Marketing Assistance;I echo the words of the previous two reviewers. I have an additional thought by way of a marketing tip for Nestle.
4;Blu-ray Movie;I think blu-ray movies are great.  Although there are some of the older movies that have been done in blu-ray that haven't really come up to the blu-ray quality that the newer movies have.
5;Excellent- but do yourself a favor and try them from the fridge!;I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.
5;Greens for your baby;I love having Plum Organics Baby Food as a choice for my baby. Whoever thought of having organic fruits and veggies in a pouch knows parents today are looking for fast, easy and healthy.
2;Don't buy unless you love margaritas!;Our family will not be buying more of this drink mix.  We couldn't even drink the pitcher we mixed up to test.
5;Great Product;This is a great product.  I have really dry skin and I use it after I get out of the shower and my skin is softer than ever.
4;Little too sweet;I was looking for a nut bar made with 100% wohle nuts for a meal replacement.<br />Saw Think Thin here and tried it.
5;Love the taste, love the smell;The first thing that hits you when you brew this is the smell that closely resembles a blueberry muffin, with a ton of blueberries in it.  I am a cream user, so that sort of the dilutes the flavor a bit, it still tastes (and smells) quite good.
2;Skip this one;This coffee plugged up my pot and didn't have near the flavor I am used to getting from a flavored coffee.  I did use it all but ended up mixing it with another flavor in order to spice it up a bit.
1;Can definitely tasted the hydrogenated soybean oil in the lemon meringue flavor - BLUCK!;The lemon meringe pudding is awful.  Tastes very plastic and like what it's made of - hydrogenated soybean oil.
1;Raccoon don't care;"I wasted the whole bottle of ""Critter ridder"" on a small lawn, which was overturned each night by a raccoon. I tried spraing on grass, then on the ground under the grass and bottom side of sod (that's where raccoon finds grubs), but it didn't care at all."
5;Delcious;I've tried a few organic maple syrups and this one - probably because it is the only grade B I tried - is easily the nicest.<br /><br />Gorgeous stuff.
3;Good oatmeal,expensive;I purchased this oatmeal with a great offer. It was good but not excellent as the regular price would lead you to believe.
5;Cheese lover;My husband I recently ate at an outside cafe in Geneva, IL.  It was late afternoon so we just wanted something light to eat with a glass of wine.
3;Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!;I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right.
5;Great training treats!;My dog's attention level increases dramatically when I use these treats for training purposes..
5;Jakemans, what a relief!;I bought these b/c I felt a sinus infection creeping up on me..
5;wonderful product;I have 3 cats. I bought this after I almost lost my male cat, Gary.
5;Zebra Mix is GREAT!;These cupcakes are the first mix my daughter made for me.  This is such a smart idea.
4;Good Coffee - One Bad Box;We were subscribed to this coffee until recently.  We got about a half-dozen boxes during our subscription.
4;3 out of 4 Paws;"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste."
5;The dogs love these treats;This is a good treat for the dogs, they love them.  They have a very cheesy (in a good way) smell that they seem to like.
3;Not Bad from a Box;Gave this one 3 stars because it does need quite a bit of work to get it where it was OK for my taste buds. I first bought this product from Sprouts.
5;Great tasting, but probably won't buy again...;We love regular Mesa Sunrise, so we had to try the Vanilla version.  It has a good flavor and my daughter thinks it tastes awesome.
5;Tasty & Not Too Sweet;"I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;My cat liked it;My cat likes this dry food, and I hear that it will help him from forming crystals in the future.<br /><br />However, I bought it at my local vet, who sold it to me for $ thirty-five dollars.
5;nummy;My boyfriend and I really like these k cups. We have tried others and they were kind of gross.
4;Quaker soft Baked Raisin cookie;I really enjoy these cookies.They taste like homemade and have lots of healthy whole grain.
5;all three cats love it;My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.
1;Disappointed;"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being ""thick"".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot."
3;Taste like cough medicine;"This is a good product to help you get your vitamins while also drinking your 8 cups of water a day.  The bottle says 1 ""squeeze"", but a squeeze could be a lot if you want or very little."
5;My dog loved it;I have a large doberman and he spent sometime on this, not like most of the other bones he gets through to quickly..
5;Impressive;I never rate things on here but I had to make an exception for this tea. Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that.
5;Quite good;I never had Tom Yum anything up until I tried this. It's very spicy, and just a bit sour.
5;Great cup of coffee;This is a really good Latte. I use my own programing and put a little more water than the pre set latte.
5;Great snack bar!;I have tried a variety of the Larabar Food Bars, and this is one of my favorites.  It is a very tart cherry flavor
4;Solid, reliable, everyday choice that pleases most everyone.;I have tried many, many coffees, and expect to try many more.  Most are perfectly acceptable for waking up in the morning, but become tiring after awhile.
4;Belly Flops- Yummy;Very excited when I received a big bag of candy for very little money. I'm kind of used to being able to look at the bag to see what type of jelly bean I'm eating, but it was neat to be able to figure it out on my own.
5;Brought back memories;This was so fun to open, I bought it for my brother's 40th birthday and he was a big candy eater(pillowcase on Halloween), so he remembered lots of the items.  His 3 year old son also enjoyed it.
1;Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.;I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.
5;Dont buy online, great product, horrible price.;I give this product 5 stars, the price is zero stars.<br /><br />You can buy a case of 8 (not 6) jars at Whole Foods for $27.
4;Steel Cut Oatmeal;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great value on java;Green Mountain coffee is very good and this was the best value I've seen anywhere.  I love the smooth flavor and richness of this coffee.
5;Great alternative pasta;This was excellent tasting pasta.  I wanted an alternative to whole-wheat pasta, which I do not care for, and this was far better than I hoped.
5;Love 'em!;"These are my all-time favorite ""store-bought"" cookies! They have an intense flavor without being overpowering. Love the spicy bits of ginger."
2;One seed germinate;Only one seed germinate and I like it. But feeling sad that only one seed germinate.
5;Miracle food for pets with skin conditions;I cannot say enough good about this dogfood - it is nothing short of miraculous.  We have a Westie with the classic bad skin, itchy, hot spots.
4;I liked it;smooth.  I normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal (or maybe a friday sale).
5;Good price, and just the right size;These are perfect for my bf and myself. They are perfect size for a snack or for myself I have sugar issues so this is a good source of protein when my sugar is getting low.
5;Muscle spasms;My wife has recurring extreme muscle spasms, usually late at night or early morning.  We started to use this water for her about 6 months ago.
5;Delicious;The Vanilla is great! I have used almost a whole bottle in a month. :)I would definitely purchase this again.
5;Sweet Memories Received;After searching for a long time to find thin ribbon candy, I was rewarded via Amazon. When my package arrived it was in perfect condition, and there was very little breakage in the package.
2;Yuck!;I love the concept of the Sodastream, but the Cola flavor could be better, even more so when they try to compare it to Pepsi. I know with non-brands there will always be a difference, but this flavor is not good.
5;Great all by themselves;These San-J Black Sesame Rice Crackers are so good that I just eat them by themselves. I also like the San-J sesame brown rice made with regular sesame seeds instead of black sesame seeds, but like these black sesame variety a bit more.
5;A Calorie Free Chocolate Glazed Donut;With a bit of artificial sweetener and a burst of whipped cream, I feel like I am enjoying a chocolate glazed donut.  A calorie free donut at that!  You can't go wrong with this flavor.
5;Werther's Original Caramel Coffee;I am very pleased with my order of Werther's Original Caramel Coffee Hard Candies, 5.5 oz bags (Pack of 12).
5;excellent, smooth bold;Love this coffee - it is very bold so can get large mug and still has good taste. Works nicely as an iced coffee also.
5;My favorite;This is my favorite coffee. It has a great flavor and when bought through Amazon.
2;Does not Keep;I purchased this and really enjoyed the first box.  However, a few weeks later when I went to cook another box there were bugs, like flour bugs, in the pasta and I had to throw it all away.
5;Love!;I love this gum! I can't find it anywhere but here! I keep buying it. It ships very fast and I've been happy with every purchase.
5;Yummy!;If you are used to eating regular peanut butter (like JIF or Peter Pan), this will probably not be palatable to you. If you are used to eating natural PB, then you will likely appreciate this product a bit more.
5;Annie's homegrown berry patch;I love, love, love gummy/jelly type candies so I purchased these because they are organic.  I wasn't disappointed.
5;Solved all of my Frenchie Issues;Prior to finding this food my super sensitive French Bulldog had countless amount of food allergy related issues (bald spots, dark spots, bad coat, constant itching, air licking, etc.) and now after being on this food he's like a new dog.
5;Best Honey;This is absolutely the best honey on the market.  Great for use in cooking, sweetens coffee and tea to perfection!  Will not purchase any other brands.
5;Strawberry Matcha Forever!;Mmmm strawberries. I cannot begin to tell you how much of my life has been spent picking strawberries.
4;It remains to be seen;Natural health reading materials say that Ceylon cinnamon is better than the other store bought cinnamon. So far taste and smell is good but for the food value, I just have to wait to see the result.
5;this is the best instant by far.....;if you are tired of throwing out old coffee, just want a cup, like it strong(like us) or weak..
5;smashed boxes;I switched from soda to crystal light a few years ago. I love the singles, but it's getting harder to find the flavors I like in stores.
4;There definitely is an odor, BUT...;I want folks to know that this ear cleaner definitely has a distinct odor, contrary to what the other review says. However, I am buying lots more of this great stuff, as my kitties don't mind it at all and I find it to be very gentle, effective and it really is natural, with only 4 ingredients.
5;Wonderful aroma, perfect color and great taste;I was ambivalent about trying this or any non brand name coffee on the internet but decided to take a chance.<br />I have been buying coffee from web sites for years with great success, but increasing prices and lesser quality started creeping in.
5;Great coffee!;I've bought these coffee packets from Arbuckle's two years in a row..
5;My favorite chamomile tea!;Stash is my favorite chamomile tea, so I'm glad I found it in bulk at a good price. I usually have to scour the 99-cent stores to find a few boxes, so now I can get enough to last me a long while.
3;Just OK;I was attracted to the price, size and pecan flavor.  The coffee is not bad for the money, but I found the roast to be very weak.
5;Great!;I have not tried any other Stevia products but this one is great.  My husband even likes it and he is very particular.
1;EXTREMELY SMALL BOXES! VERY DISAPPOINTING;Just received these two boxes which I purchased to go in my son's stocking for Christmas, but the boxes are so small, I regret ordering them, especially for $10! BE WARE! These boxes are about the size of a cigarette lighter. (I bought a box of these years ago and they were a regular size candy box, so i had expected these to be about the same size.
1;Disappointed;I was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. I have purchased Blue Mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great.
5;What took me so long?;Those craisins at the grocery store have been masquerading. THESE are scrumptious and not available at the local grocery store.
5;THE Best Pretzels = they are better than those with gluten;MY husband cannot became alergic to gluten about a year ago and thus we have been trying all kinds of products.  These are expensive so I buy my kids pretzel's at the grocery store.
5;Best seasoning ever!;I used to think Lawry's had the best taco seasoning but nothing compares to this!  For perfect tacos, add the taco seasoning to one pound of cooked (and drained) ground beef, and instead of adding water, add one can of diced tomatoes.  I really cant make tacos any other way now.
5;Mellow, full bodied;Without beating it to death - If you like a full bodied, but mellow brew this might be for you.  It is hearty, but not at all bitter.
5;Absolute Life Saver!;My 14 year old kitty's mouth does not work so well anymore, and she has trouble eating most of the grain free wet foods, which tend to be too chunky or solid. This awesome wet food is full of jelly and broth as well as meat, and it's PERFECT for an old kitty's mouth.
5;Etoufee by Zatarain is great;Etoufee by Zatarain is just as good as I remember at restaurants in New Orleans.  Simple and easy to prepare too.
1;Korea FDA reports that this noodle has too much benzopyrene;Firtst above all, DO NOT EAT THIS CANCER-CAUSING NOODLE!<br />Recently Korea FDA reported and warned customers that this noodle has too much BENZOYPRENE.Benzoyprene is an organic compound with the formula C20H12.
5;Excellent coffee;It is one of my favourite coffee so far.  It is perfect not too weak or strong.
5;You can't go wrong with Stash.;I love this tea!  Especially since it's a green tea with caffeine
3;Shipping and packaging problem;The cookies came crumbled into many pieces in 3 of the boxes I opened.  Also the chocolate chips had melted onto the cellophane.
4;Finicky Cat Purrs While Eating;"Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken compares favorable with <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;One of my favorite gluten-free snacks;"Oh, these are yummy.  Even my gluten-eating family loves them and says they're better than ""real"" pretzels."
5;Yummy noodles!;Love Kung Pao flavor! I couldn't find it in the local grocery store and glad that Amazon has it. Taste might be too strong for some people but this is just right for me.
5;Dogs Love Them;I've been buying these for my two dogs for a year now and they LOVE THEM. I've also noticed that their teeth look cleaner.
4;Delicious, Preservative-Free and Grown in the USA;These dried cherries are grown in the USA and are delicious to eat plain or to use as a topping on cereal or as part of a trail mix.<br /><br />Another plus--they don't have any preservatives or sulfites added.
5;My dog loves these;My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs, but my yellow lab loves them (she's about 4 years old).
5;Sososo tasty. &lt;
5;So yummy!;This is my second order..
5;Best in Class Dry Dog Food;Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars)
5;My dog loves this!;Well, it must taste good, 'cause my dog just loves it.  It did take a minute to teach him to lick it instead of just trying to grap it out of my hand.
5;Wonderful Earl Grey Tea;I have been caffeine free for a year now and I do appreciate products that are truly caffiene-free (rather than low-caffeine). This tea is as caffeine free as they come, and it has a wonderful flavor -- unlike any other Earl Grey I have tried.
5;The Best Gum Ever!;This is my favorite gum of all the trident flavors.  I love that it does not have coloring and it's flavor lasts.
5;Awesome Snack;My husband can eat an entire container in one sitting.  He just loves them.
5;My dog LOVES it!;She is begging me all the time for these. She loves them!! I used to buy them in the small bottle.
1;Upset mom with broken suckers;I was so excited to have found neat dinosaur lollipops to hand out to the children at my daughters birthday party. When I opened the first box of twelve and had three that were not broken, I hoped the second box would be better.
1;Nasty fake sweetener aftertaste;I purchased this even after a few other reviewers mentioned that there is a fake sweetener taste thinking it would be ok but the taste is really overwhelming. If you are ok with drinking diet soda you will be ok with these.
4;Yum!;I just got put on a gluten and peanut-free diet a few days ago. I hate diets of any sort, am kind of picky, and needed to make a dessert for a family get together.
5;A nice change from straight chamomile;I keep pure chamomile flowers on hand because I love the flavor and aroma of a soothing cup of warm chamomile tea*. But occasionally I have a hankering for something a bit mellower, and rather than adding honey to my chamomile brew, I turn to Celestial Seasonings Honey Vanilla Chamomile.
1;dangerous product;As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first.
5;Strawberry Delight;This is a nice tasting white tea.  When brewing the Strawberry Paraiso make sure to steep for 2 minutes.
5;Delicious tea;I have purchased this tea in sachets in the past and really enjoyed the flavor. This bulk package was a great value.
5;Muddy Bears are fantastic;We love the Muddy Bears.  By purchasing through Amazon we save money, get a great product and don't have to go to a Movie Theater to enjoy our snacks.
1;ugh;I never write reviews but in this case I had to make an exception.  To put it simply this stuff was HORRIBLE.
4;Love some, hate some;The cheddar flavor is THE BEST. Sour cream and onion is not far behind.
1;Wow!! Awesome...;Wow man!! Awesome price $1.99 for 6 mangoes and roughly $12 shipping.
5;Delicious and very healthy;These are amazing little bars. Filling, yummy and all natural.
5;Yummy tea;I love this tea..
5;verrrrrrrry good;"Just add water,baked very well in toaster oven.used Cuisenart pan 9"" B0000ULZY0 MODEL #AMB-9LP dishwasher safe,and yes it is a little like a cake."
4;Robust taste, packaging could be better.;We purchase on Subscribe and Save, 3 boxes a month.  I like the little filters instead of the pods.
5;Used in an EasyBake oven;I love that I can buy things like this on Amazon and ship them direct to my granddaughter (love Prime!).  My six year old granddaughter received an EasyBake oven for her birthday.
4;TASTES LIKE PEANUTS;Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed.  Tastes like peanuts, but still lacks something with the fat removed.
5;Yum!;Grove Square Single Serve Cappuccino Cups, French Vanilla, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count<br /><br />I was concerned it would taste watered down, but I think this is delicious.  The caramel flavor in this brand is excellent, too.
5;A great tea to help your throat.;This is a good tea to drink if you spend a lot of time using your voice to make a living.  Comforts the vocal cords nicely and I found it helpful during the cold season.
5;after years of trying everything;this is the only food my dogs with sensitive stomachs could eat without spitting up.  I was so relieved to find it and from all that I read, it gets great reviews across the board.
5;Expresso extra bold coffee;I am very pleased with the coffee.  So much that I sought to reorder but found that the price had increased to a point where it is now more economical to purchase locally at Bed, Bath and Beyond with their discount.
4;It's PRIME-arily Lobster;if it's primarily made from lobster, what else is in there? I wonder. Primarily.
2;The're not bad cookies;And the're not good cookies.  They are just cookies.
5;Much Better than Similar Quaker Product;"I was a big fan of the Quaker nut bars but I'm officially switching to these. The nuts are more ""whole"" in the Planters bars, and taste more peanutty to me."
3;good spice.  o.k. flavor.;I had high hopes for this popcorn but it underwhelmed.  It has nice heat but the flavor is a little boring.
4;The best non-flavored, Medium Roast KCup coffee;Don't be hesitant to try this coffee because of the name. I was looking for a good MEDIUM ROAST-NON FLAVORED kcup and this is it.
5;The best baklava;I have tried so many baklava and this is simply the best. The only con is that it's very addictive and very fatty.
5;dinty moore scalloped potatoes and ham;This is a very easy go to food I like to keep in my stock its very tasty an hardy stick to your ribs kinda food . Thankfully I was able to find it at amazon.
3;just get the blue;The blue corn is great, extra flavorful and apparently more nutritious than white popcorns
5;Tastey Cholesterol Helper;They recommend 2 chews a day to help with the cholesterol.  My problem is only eating 2!  These are a great help with both my cholesterol and my diet.
1;TOTALLY DECEPTIVE PICTURE;The picture shows a package of 10 Greenies but when you order it, you only receive one!  What a total absolute ripoff.  After going around with Amazon Customer Service though, I'm happy to say they are going to refund my money.
4;Love the taste, hard to find;To each their own..
5;Slimming Tea Works;I have been using this product for two years.  It won't make you slim, but it will flush your colon.
4;Pretty Good;This honey is delicious in tea, although I've found that I have to use quite a bit to get it sweet enough. I have some acne scars on my face, and redness.
3;There are more nutritious options out there ~~~~;I have a 1.5 -year-old, 60-pound Boxer/Pitt Mix she loved the food
5;Hormel Compleats Chicken Breast and Dressing;I love it.  To my tastes its the best of the Compleats line.
1;expensive box of brownie mix.;$17.00 for one box of brownie mix seems a bit pricey.
5;Superb Pickles;Having taught in a German community for eleven years, these pickle rival the home made pickles that I used to enjoy at community events. The pickles are a mild dill pickle with a whisper of sweetness.
5;DELICIOUS! I liked these pancakes better than traditional pancakes!;My husband just made these for me after I picked up the mix last week at the grocery store. All I can say is these are DELICIOUS! He said he pretty much stuck to the directions (but he often eyeballs things too).
5;Finally good sleep;I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night.
5;Good Stuff!;A bit pricey, but good deal at Amazon, though there are more expensive ones.<br /><br />Very nice orange citrus flavor.
1;Wine drips from the device;If you purchase this product, have plenty of paper towels nearby.  The wine will leak from the sides of the device and you will be cleaning up after you pour wine through it.
5;minty;Fresh and fantastic. I usually brew mint with some sencha and then refrigerate for a refreshing tea.
1;Thought I'd try a bite of the good life;"I've never had caviar before, but based on the glowing reviews and the cheap price, I thought I'd cross caviar of my bucket list. I love the flying fish roe that comes on sushi (though it's pretty tasteless, the little ""POP!"" of the eggs is addictive) and I love overly salty food (I regularly drink pickle juice), but this was F-I-S-H-Y."
5;Can Wolfgang make a bad k-cup?;These are awesome..
1;this is nasty ! DO NOT BUY THIS ! it does NOT taste like any nacho or spicy.;its a shame i just wasted 25 bucks for this garbage.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IT .
5;This honey has a delicious, mild clover flavor.;I've tried the YS brand raw honey/royal jelly gel. That was very soft, reminding me texture-wise of the inside of a Cadbury egg.
3;Very meh;Cans came super dented and messed up but I didn't care about that. The tea tastes like water and sweet n' low with raspberry syrup.
5;dentastix for toys;My Chin loves them.  Dental issues are very prevalent in toy dogs so these really work with regular brushing and an oral supplement added to his drinking water.
5;Great Treats;Our two dogs love these treats.  They are great to train a puppy because you can hold the treat and the dogs can have a nibble instead of giving them the whole treat.
5;Still great bags - been using for 5+ years;We have been using these bags for at least five years, originally buying them in a 400-pack from eBay. When our long-time seller stopped making them available I was happy to track them down on Amazon.
4;Very good;I love that these are vegetarian.  Other toaster pastries contain gelatin, which I try to stay away from.
5;Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Co.  French Roast Coffee;This French Roast, as well as their other coffee flavors, are the very best that I have ever tasted!  It is also a great bargin .  For many years I've tried various coffees such as Gevalia, Starbucks and others.
5;delicious soft chewy ginger candy;It was difficult to find Gins Gins Boost at any store, so I ordered them online.  If you like a strong ginger taste, this is the candy for you.
5;I've found my new favorite tea!;This tea is amazing.  I've tried several brands of black tea with berries, but the berry flavor usually tastes artificial and a bit syrupy to me.
5;Kind Bars from Amazon;The Kind Cranberry Almond bars are healthy for you and<br />are a good source of antioxidants.  I use them for a<br />breakfast bar and keeps me satisfied unitl lunch.
5;Yummy!;Yeah, I know that salt is salt, but I like the taste of this salt. It wasn't as costly as many of the gourmet salts, so I use it to make my own seasoned salts for myself and for gifts.
5;Zombie brains;These worked perfectly. I mixed red jello, with 1 cup hot water.
5;Cowabunga!;Our little rat terrier can usually make a ten minute snack out of the biggest rawhide treats. This thing has kept him very busy for three to four days on a refil, and the main ingredients are not nearly as likely to clog his pipes.
5;Rocks!;I love this stuff. It helps me keep my potassium intake up! I use this while I'm cooking and then top my food with some finishing salt.
5;Mackintosh Toffee;I received the toffee I ordered within a few days.  I always have bought the toffee bar before, but thought I would try the pieces this time.
5;Delicious;If you like coconut then you are in for a treat. It is not what I consider to be water as its a little thicker than 'juice'.
5;Cardiac Tune-Up and more;Takes a little time to adjust to the taste (its not bad and becomes good in a short matter of time) but the health benefits are well worth the adjustment.  I drink this and the flavored variety in place of artifical sweetened drinks.
1;Expected more;I always enjoy Starbucks PSL's so I thought this was going to be a great buy.  Mistake I made is I bought a lot of this.
4;Good soft cookie, deceptive packaging;These are soft and chocolaty, and I like them better than the crunchy chips ahoy, but they still have that store-bought taste.<br />The packaging seems to be too big for the cookies, as a consequence they were a jumbled mess, I normally check the nutrition info and then divide by the members of the family to see how many each person gets, but so many of them were broken that it didn't end very well this time.
5;Red Bull Energy Drink;It consistently delivers. This is a product I simply cannot live without.
5;Great way to wake up;This is the perfect coffee when traveling.  I know it will always taste great and it is easy to prepare.
4;Cost is too high!;I love these prunes because they are always fresh and easy to take with me. My 2.
5;Delicious;These were both beautiful and delicious.  The strawberries were very large and perfectly ripened with just the right amount of chocolate.
5;Love Love Love;These are excellent and they are Weight Watcher friendly.  I have them with Salsa, Spinach Dip and Sandwiches.
5;Awesome Food!;I bought two strips of this before I went backpacking. While on the trail I decided to break out my snack not knowing what to expect.
5;Chocolate Tootsie Pops from CandyMafia via Amazon;I ordered the 60 count Chocolate Tootsie Pops.  At 60 Calories and 0 fat, they are my daily reward for staying on my diet.
5;Special K Bars Extrodinaire;This is indeed the best and most tasty bar on the market. Delicious, crunchy, and I can't live without it.
5;My Mom Can't Live Without It;My mother has eaten this cereal since her teens.  She is now 84.
5;The best hot sauce out of specialty hot sauces.;This is the obnoxiously hot with a lot of flavor. A bottle usually lasts me a year.
5;Gotta' have These on Hand!  Diabetic's - Heads up!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;Helped me with my squirrel problem;Just so you don't think this is a useless product, as many of these reviews seem to suggest..
5;GOOD TEA;This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
5;The BEST base for chicken broth!;I've used this for years, mainly in soups and gravies.  You simply cannot get this flavor using standard chicken bullion.
1;Awful Taste!;"I bought this product after reading about the benefits of it from ""First Magazine for Women."" I picked it up at Whole Foods for $5."
5;Delicious Snack/Energy Bar without That Nasty Fake Sweetener Taste;"I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the ""energy"" bars and ""nutrition"" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste."
5;Muesli;I have purchased Bob's products for years and enjoy all of them.  They are high-quality! I eat oatmeal everyday and use Muesli as an add-in to the plain old-fashioned type.
5;Top notch Scotch;I have been home brewing off and on for about a decade.  I am truly impressed with<br />the quality of ingredients and was amazed with the final product.
5;Butter toffee yum!;My favorite was French toast flavor but this one is my new favorite. Smells and tastes like butter toffee.
5;Great tea, available for less.;This tea is GREAT. I bought mine local, and I'm pretty sure it was quite a bit less than the $11.
4;Husband Likes This Okay;We have found another that he likes better, but my husband says this is a fairly good coffee.  I drink Decaf and he drinks the regular, so I have to go by what he says about the regular coffees.
5;Great tasting & Nutritious;These hemp seed are very good tasting. They are kind of nutty yet buttery in the same sense.
1;Two Leaves and Blah;I saw this Chai Tea when I was shopping here for the Tazo Chai Tea.  I read the 3 reviews which all gave 5 stars so decided to give it a try.
5;A must have for all dogs.;My 10 year old dog has been plagued his entire life with back and joint pain.  We had tried Rimadyl, Deramaxx and Prednisone at different intervals over the years to give him some relief.
3;Price Vs. Flavor;I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great.
5;Great;I love Flaming hot munches. They are my favourite kind of snack.
1;TOO TOUGH AND STRINGY FOR SMALL DOGS-CHOKING HAZARD;My dogs LOVE duck treats and have been getting the chicken happy hips for years so I though I'd give the duck a try.  Bad idea.
3;Cool toy, but dog not really interested;I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.<br /><br />He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end.
3;good, but not pure matcha;This tea is ok, but don't let the word matcha in the title fool you.  This has a tiny amount of matcha in each bag and it is not bright green like fresh match is supposed to be.
5;My lab loves these!;"My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top ""dome"" part of the treat  and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball."
1;My cat tried to bury this food.;My cat and my neighbor's cats would not eat this food. I wound up giving the case to the cat rescue organization.
2;Just so so...;I read a review and was excited to try this salt. I didn't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion.
5;Delicious tea sampler...;I purchased this tea set for a friend who is into tea and it shipped quickly in lovely packaging and made a great gift. Also, the friend said all the teas are delicious and he loves being able to mix and brew.
5;Great Product!;I recently discovered this spicy-hot mayonnaise in Maui.  It is a grand addition to my kitchen inventory - I use it with beef, sliced ham, salads, sandwiches - anything you can envision for a good-quality mayo with a kick to it.
3;I Agree! Very Salty!;At first bite the saltiness hits pretty hard but it kinda grows on you after eating a few. Don't think I'll buy again.
1;Bad. Bad. Bad.;This is literally the worst salsa I have ever eaten. I bought this thinking it would be spicy.
5;Very good;I read up on agave nectar and decided I wanted to try it for a healthier sugar option, and this was definitely the best price I found. I got it just in time for my peach tree to get ripe and used it in making cobblers and muffins and other peach recipes.
5;Great Treat;What a great find--my favorite coffee flavor with stress-free ordering and shipping.  And a really good price to add to its appeal.
5;raw cacao nibs;if you like chocolate.  then try these.
5;Quick treat and they love em;"Like the title says ""Quick"" your dog can devour one of these and will come back for more. This version of the product is pressed together and easy to chew."
4;A tasty snack without the bad stuff.....;However the first thing to note about these is your going to be hammered with a strong garlic/onion after taste. And your significant other will remind you of this the next day.
5;Our kitties LOVE this food!!!!;I wasn't sure how my cats would like Petite Cuisine, because they are Friskies cats.  Man, do they love their friskies: seafood, chicken, or maybe a little turkey (but they don't like beef).
5;DO NOT OVERCOOK;Be careful not to overcook this pasta
5;I like its taste;I do not like instant noodle much. But I do have them available just in case I need a quick meal.
3;Just Okay - Hidden Decaf.;Taste is okay.  Not blown away.
4;IT WAS BROKEN!;WHEN THE TREE WAS DELIVERED IT LOOKED GREAT, BUT I NOTICED AFTER ABOUT 2- 3 WEEKS IT STARTED DYING. LATER I LOOKED CLOSELY AND THE TREE HAD BEEN BROKEN AT THE TRUNK.
1;blah;I bought these thinking they would be great because they are Annie's.  I usually enjoy anything made by Annie's.
5;Liver Biscotti Dog Treats;I had a sample pack of the liver biscottin and my dogs loved it.  So I bought the large bag and it is a good value and the dogs cannot wait to get their treat.
4;Wasabi Peas;Great product. Very fresh, excellent horseradish flavor.
5;Cheaper in store right now;I love this coffee. Went on line today thinking I could get better pricing than the stores, but found the sale at Meijers to be a better deal.
5;Favorite Of The Keurig Coffee K-cups;This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..
5;Bestest beverage ever!;Seriously this is a ten star product.  I would choose it over any other drink in the world, it is really that good.
4;Good quality but not my favorite;I'm a big fan of chocolate and of Newman's Own products, so I was very excited to try their chocolate. This bar is 54% cocoa, which I consider somewhere between milk and dark chocolate (but more towards dark), and this is right in my personal sweet spot.
5;AKA MISO SOUP;I enjoy a hot cup of this soup when I want a vegitarian option (rather than the usual instant chicken soup).  I prefer the taste of the AKA variety over the Shiro variety.
5;Farmer Brother's Ice Tea;I had the best ice tea ever at a bar and grill (Chuy's) in Phoenix Arizona.<br />I inquired and found that they used Farmer Brother's Ice Tea.
3;Good coffee, but weak flavor;The coffee itself is pretty good, but only if you don't realize it's supposed to taste like Kahlua. It doesn't taste a thing like it.
5;refreshingly good;I'm obsessed with Golazo's Mandarina energy drink -- it's delicious orange taste is refreshingly good -- especially after finishing a work out. It not only tastes amazing, it is also guilt-free energy.
3;Great company, Great food, but my puppy won't eat it...;We have a picky puppy.  After doing a lot of research on dog food, I chose Eagle Pack.
5;Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...;I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks.
5;pooping reindeer stocking stuffer;This is a fun and hilarious stocking stuffer. But the person receiving this needs to have a really good sense of humor.
3;Okay;It's okay, fast cooking, but there are others I prefer.  That said, eating my way through 11 pounds will take awhile.
4;Very Good!;I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good.
4;Surprisingly delicious;I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.
5;Trio bars are delicious!  My favorite energy/snack bars;Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.
5;Just Right Anytime of Day!;I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter
5;The Best;We've owned several wine bottle resealers, but this is by far the best design.  This is our second Vacu Vin, and both are working like new.
5;outstanding quality, great price;Stash's Organic Pinhead Gunpowder Green Tea, Loose Leaf, is the best of the best of green tea's.  It is rich, smooth, and looks like liquid gold in the cup.
5;My Doctor suggested these;So far I have only tried the Vanilla and Chocolate and they were both excellent! These bars were suggested by one of the top weight loss Doctors in the country. Combining these bars for breakfast, having a protein and vegetable for lunch and a protein and vegetable for dinner and sugar free jello or sugar free pudding .
5;A good lapsang souchong;I've had Twinings Lapsang Souchang and now Taylors Lapsang Souchang.  They're both very nice teas and aren't noticeably different (unless you perhaps drink them side by side).
5;Maxwell House International Coffee Suisse Mocha Cafe, 7.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4);The Price Is Right for the Maxwell House International Coffee Suisse Mocha Cafe, 7.2-Ounce Cans.
1;horrible flavors, not worth the money;I hated the flavors. The sausage bean tasted nothing like sausage.
5;Best Chai;I love this chai, I've tried all the powdered ones, big train, etc and tiger spice is by far the best. As opposed to the other review posted here, I find that the fine crystalline form of the powder is easily dissolvable and indicated high quality.
5;Perfect in Yogurt or on Cereal;I try to eat healthy, and I try to buy products that are not filled with chemicals or additives, and are made in the USA. Kind Healthy Grains meets all of those requirements, plus it tastes great.
2;Rank and Bitter;"Why I thought I'd enjoy this coffee:<br /><br />1. My daily coffee is <a href=""http://www."
1;Way over priced;I got the same product at the Hershey store in Times Sq. NY for 15 dollars.
5;My son loves it;My son is on a gluten free diet and he loves this rice cereal.  We also use it tointroduce new foods because he will pretty much eat anything if mixed with this cereal.
1;Not gluten free;Just a warning..
5;My all time favorite tea....;I am now receiving a case of this tea every six months - for a great price!  The tea is always fresh.  Packets are foil sealed and each cup consistently comes out with a nice cinnamon orange flavor.
5;Great, caffeine-free tea;I'm not generally a fan of herbal teas -- most are too floral or minty for my taste -- but my wife bought a box of these at Whole Foods and, after trying it out, I was hooked. It has a really nice, caramel flavor without being too sweet.
5;Wonderful product;I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it.
5;Amazon did it again....yummy!;just what i expected. slight citrus taste and crunchey like you get at the chinese restaurant.
1;Tastes Confused And Ugly;"The only words that comes to me is, UGLY Tasting Brown Fluid"". It is the least drinkable coffee I have tasted."
5;Amazingly good!;These were the most moist, delicious and flavorful brownies I've ever tasted.<br />Only negative was there is no information on the nutritional values (fat, calories) of the brownies.
5;Total Sums It Up;I've been a Total junkie for years.  After several successive years of excellent results on my annual physicals, I figure this must be one of the things this old Nam Vet is doing right.
5;Best Can Soup EVER!;This is the best can organic vegetable soup ever!  I have tried lots of veggie soups out there and nothing compares to this soup, but you have to pay the price for this soup.  As much as I love it, I am not always willing to pay the price for a can of soup.
3;bogus handle;Like others, I bought this so I could be like Alton Brown, pinching out kosher salt as needed.  First, the good.
4;Works well;I love baking bread. I'm an experimenter.
5;DEEEE-LISH!!;Put a few of these in your purse or backpack, for sure.  They are so much more delicious and hunger-satisfying than I had anticipated.
5;Great Product Poor Price;Kellogg's Rasin Bran is very tasty but who in thier right mind would pay practically $5.00 a box for it? This is commonly on sale for $2.
5;My Dog Gives this 2 paws!;I love my dog and try to give her the best products that are out there. This product is organic and my dog loves them.
1;terrible....;I bought a total of 96..
5;Only gluten free bread my 8 year old likes and will eat!;My 8 year old was recently diagnosed with Celiacs and, after purchasing numerous GF breads and bread mixes to try, this is the only GF bread he likes and will eat.  It is the most child-friendly GF bread we have found by far.
5;dog food;This is a little pricey, but well worth it.  I figure spend more on the food now, and less on vet bills later from Cancer and other side effects of harmful things in their food.
5;Healthy plants - No more over watering!;Very affordable product. Works well and is quite accurate! I like that it is very discreet and you have enough for 5 plants.
5;(*Insert noise from happy babbling baby here);My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself.
5;Consistently Good Darjeeling Tea;I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.
5;Heavenly!;I've never tried raspberry honey before. I can't get over how tasty it is!<br />It smells like chocolate and raspberries and I keep sneaking spoonfuls every time I pass the kitchen :)<br />Definitely recommend that one.
5;"I never believed in a ""perfect"" snack until Bugles came and proved me wrong!";These might just very well be the best snack food I've ever eaten.  These are the perfect combo of sweetness and saltiness!  The chocolate coating is very smooth to your tongue when you pop one of these in your mouth.
5;Many uses for this healthy body tonic;A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives).  Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did!  It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain.
3;Fruit flavored blue and yellow, pink is yummier!;"Pretty good, but I actually prefer ""Fluffy Stuff"" as the best packaged cotton candy I've tried.  That tastes better, and has a better and finer texture."
4;Good quality food, but Amazon's ingredient listing is incorrect;We have a cat with a liver problem who needs a low-purine diet.  As a result, we are trying to switch her off of her Wellness food and find poultry alternatives that do not contain any organ meat.
5;Happy Pasta Lover;This item is hard for me to find locally.  If I happen to come across it, it's very expensive.
5;What took them so long?;Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are the same Honey Maid Graham crackers you know and love, just packaged differently.  8 fresh little graham squares to a packet, just right for school lunches or tossing in your pocket or bike bag.
4;very good product;"I had tried Weruva flavors with veggies in them and my cats either wouldn't eat as much of the bowl, would eat around them or kick the peas around the room!  This one and the ""paw lickin chicken"" were preferred by them.  There are huge chunks of fish in here that make you feel like you're opening it for yourself."
5;Stomach Issues are Gone!;My dog has been having stomach issues for the past couple of years.  I started feeding her sensitive system mixed with plain yogurt.
5;The best pancake mix ever;This was better than other pancake mixes which call for dairy ingredients.  Our family loved it!  It made nice and fluffy pancakes.
5;Exceptionally great pretzels!!!;BEIGEL PRETZELS, SUPER LONG STICKS<br />Wonderful taste, just enough salt with a very very slight sweetness to them. Served them to many friends and they raved about the size being so very thin, and very, very long.
5;Great Taste!;I'm not a beef stick/beef jerky eater.  These were bought for my son's school snack, however I have eaten a few and really like the beef flavor.
5;great coffee great price;Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.
5;Hard to rate;This item is hard to review because it has not caught any moths. But, that may be good, because it may mean that we don't have any moths.
2;Tiny tiny box;The product itself is fine, but it is a tiny tiny box of jelly beans.  Very hard to justify the price.
5;Love Belgian Hazelnut;I've been drinking this since I was expecting my son and wanted a hot drink that didn't have so much caffeine (he's 18 now).  This product has a lot of sugar, but it also has tons of flavor.
5;Great taste, tender meat;This is great jerky.  The meat is tender and not overly-dried.
5;Finally!  A healthy treat with taste!;As one of many Americans trying to make healthier life choices in my food, Nana's cookies have been a wonderful treat without the guilt and bad effects of sugar, and gluten.  The cookies are moist and almost cake-like and sweetened with fruit juice, though the rich and vibrant flaver does not give this away.
4;Organic, tasty, but pricey and with sugar;This is the second brand of puffs we have tried, the first being the felicitous infant brand.  The things I like are that they are yummy (this is the only flavor we've tried) and the ingredients are all organic.
5;Great catfood with good ingredients;My kitty is not a picky cat to eat so generally I can't tell what he really likes.<br />This one, of course my kitty loves it.
4;smells better;than regular dog food.  It is chunks in gravy.
5;Magical mystery oil;The House of Tsang's Mongolian Fire oil is a critical and irreplaceable ingredient in my fried rice recipe, a staple of my diet which I eat nearly every day.<br /><br />When my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I tried a number of other oriental pepper oils but they couldn't hold a candle to Tsang's.
5;Great product;Greenies are great.  Our greyhound loves all of the products and promptly eats them up.
4;Green Tea;Green tea is healthier than regular Lipton tea thats why I bought it. If im going to drink tea why not drink a healthy tea.
5;Excellent!;No other Tartar Sauce can compare to Kraft.  I tried them all and the best one is this one.
5;Yummy!;These fig bars are naturally sweet and so tastey.  My whole family just loves them and they are a healthy, nutritious snack which is great, too.
5;It really helps;Not sure exactly what is in it, but it really helps my sinus condition.  A family member who spent time in China said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there.
5;CARDAMON;My wife is a gourmet cook. She often needs spices and oils not easily found here in San Diego.
2;Not that great;These protein chips definately weren't that great.  I can't say they were awful but they have a really grainy dry kinda taste.
3;OK Coffee;This is decent coffee. Nothing special.
4;tastes better when cold;as others have mentioned, the texture is a bit mushy/moist at room temperature.  after letting it sit in the fridge (which i do before opening), i find the taste and texture more appealing.
5;Some of my favorite tea for iced tea;I love this stuff!  I have tried dozens of tea for icing, but this is one of my favorites.  Fantastic Flavor.
5;Best Roasted Almonds;I've tried several other brands of roasted salted almonds available via the Internet and in stores.  The Blue Diamond brand is definitely the best tasting of all.
5;Now Quinoa Organic Grain;Now continues to conduct itself in excellence. I use the keenwa for sprouting and have found Now's product to be of the highest quality.
4;Good but very small;The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.
5;excellent tea;First time trying guayusa tea - just as described, smooth and stimulating.  Much easier on the stomach than coffee, no jitters (even though I drink 2-3 cups throughout the morning).
4;Really nutty, but melts to the packaging;I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that.
5;Delicious Cake From Amazon;A really delicious cake.  It makes a great gift.
3;HORRIBLE SHIPPING;This is a great product BUT WATCH OUT! THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SHIP CEREAL..
5;My cats can't get enough of them;It took me a while to find treats that my cats would eat.  These go beyond that for my cats.
5;Worked well on M&Ms;These worked fine when I used it to write on M&Ms. It never dried out and never clogged.
1;Ew;Very sugary 41g, not particularly good tasting. Wouldnt drink it again.
5;Fennel Tea;I love this tea.  It is mildly sweet.
5;Just like from when I was a kid...;I remember going with my mother to Payless drug store, which has turned into CVS Pharmacy here on the West Coast.  Payless used to sell these in the 80s and while the packaging is different now, the candy is still the same.
4;You do not miss the extra salt - Tastes great;I ordered one as a trial, liked it and order three more.<br /><br />It's still a little too salty for my taste but a lot better than the regular product.
5;Expensive but Worth It;This is a good, sweet drink with all natural juices.<br /><br />It's more expensive than other sodas and maybe healthier.
4;Mild and Understated;"There's nothing wrong with being ""mild and understated."" None of the tastes in this treat jump out at you but, instead, they're a good blend of several flavors and textures."
4;Actually works.;I was surprised to see that this product actually works, but they don't warn you about the god-awful smell. It's horrid, truly.
5;Blueberry Coffee;I love this flavor, truly tastes like blueberries.  I use french vanilla creamer and sweeten with sugar, though, and it ends up like a blueberry/coffee milkshake, good hot or cold.
5;Great beans and price;Eden is one of the few companies that does not have any BPA lined cans. Excellent beans at at good price.
5;Great deal!;Taste like I remember as a kid. I did not know they were made in Argentina.
5;Excellent nuts;These nuts are for my husband who loves them.  They are tender, tasty and nutritious.
5;YUM YUM YUM!;Remember the days when gum tasted good and wasn't full of flavoring that tasted like medicine, the flavor was long lasting, it didn't get hard as a rock to chew, and was the best ever to crack on the back of your teeth..
5;Excellent medium roast;Realizing that these reviews are very subjective and it is hard to judge taste..
5;Quick Delivery;I was amazed at how quick I received this order. I can't comment on the product itself as this was purchased for someone else.
5;Santa Fe Black Beans;My family loves these beans! Easy to store, quick to make. A staple in our pantry at home and at the lake.
5;On the go;This product is quite delicious and well balanced. I have recently switched over to a more natural, mostly raw diet and these bars, though not entirely raw, are a great meal on the go.
5;Great Taste;These sugar-free sour gummi worms are wonderful. The taste is just like that of the regular sour gummi worms.
3;Guess what's in this bag?;While I like the taste of the blend I received this time, I would be happier if Senseo offered a generic bean, such as Columbian Supremo instead of an unidentifiable blend. By offering a blend, Senseo can change the mix to reflect their current costs for the various Columbian beans.
5;best tea ever!;I absolutely love this tea. i am an avid water drinker but i dont mind drinking something with no sugar every now and again.
5;MS;Absolutely Wonderful, great snack!  Once you try them you can't put them down, they will leave you wanting more and more.  No more Potato Chips, Corn Chips, or any other chips needed or allowed in my house.
5;rodie;Very flavorful.  i add more water after cooking it and it tastes great.
5;One of my favorite store-bought Indian pouches;I think this one has the best flavor of the Kitchens of India choices. It has a spicy kick to it, but it's not overwhelming.
5;Superior canned crab meat;This crab meat is superior to anything you'll find in a can or frozen in the grocery store.  If you love crab cakes or cooking with crab meat, then this stuff is the next best thing to fresh crab.
3;Good taste, but not perfect;Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.
5;Awesome Cookies and great package size!;My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.
3;Not really whole Cashews;They were not really whole cashews since most of them were pieces of it. But otherwise taste was just fine.
5;Fantastic popcorn;My mother gave me one of those old-time, stand up popcorn makers like you see at carnivals or theaters. Even though we enjoyed it, the popcorn never approached the taste of theaters.
5;Good gummies;I was surprised how much the kids liked the gummies. I was just trying them out as a treat for after swimming lessons and I ran out the first day, so I made sure to bring plenty the next time:) The little packets are a perfect amount.
5;Great Hot or Iced;I bought 4 boxes of Ahmad Fruit Quartet tea for my husband when he was going through his tea kick.  A gift from the cat on Father's Day, a year+ ago.
5;Great Taste - Less Waste;Local BJs had this on sale for $28 per 80 cups.  Thought It would be worth a shot.
4;Pretty good;I've been drinking this tea every morning with soy milk or almond milk, and enjoying every minute of it. I agree with other reviewers that it becomes bitter quickly with oversteeping, yet overall it's a great tea for the price.
4;Good Coffee;The shipment arrived on time and in good condition. It was a gift for a co-worker who mentioned she used to love this flavor of coffee but couldn't find it anywhere.
5;Excellent Tea!;This tea is a wonderfully tasting tea.  It has a great aroma and lifts the spirits!  The price was good as well.
3;V8;Sent it to my Dad who was sick and couldn't swallow.  When I bought it the price was much less and the shipping was free.
4;Great Tasting K-Cup!;Bed Bath and Beyond used to sell this brand but stopped carrying it about 6 or 8 months ago. It is a very smooth tasting medium roast blend with no bitter aftertaste.
1;Shipping makes these much more expensive than grocery store;GREAT crackers.  But for those who say these are cheaper than at their store they probably weren't including shipping.
3;Cats like these but packaging is ridiculous;Our cats do like these wet food treats.  They haven't actually told me that, but they come running when they think they're going to get one.
5;Date pieces;I love these - they are so easy to eat and not sticky like the whole dates. I love to mix them with raisins and I eat them daily.
1;Tastes like cardboard......;These were actually cheaper in my local grocery store so i figured i'd give them a try.  I've had gluten free before, and quite a few are pretty tasty.
5;Good stuff!!;Very nice stuff. Not too sweet (not sweet at all).
5;Tasty;This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.
5;smoothest coffee I've had;This brings me back to the time I spent in Europe. Better than any coffee at the supermarket for basically the same price.
3;Flip for flops;I ordered two bags of the flops.  I agree with some of the other posters in saying the variety isn't that great.
1;Splenda / Sucralose in all flavours...;I'm not a fan of diet soda, and even the Non-Diet flavours have splenda in them.  This does let them have a more concentrated product and therefore a smaller bottle, but I don't like the taste.
5;Oh! What Good Tea!;This is a very nice tea.  It brews fast in cold water.
5;Excellent and tasty;Used to be able to buy 50 pounds of mushroom popcorn right from the supplier when we lived in NE so this brought it back to us but in a smaller quantity.  Don't think there is any popcorn better than mushroom so was delighted to find this product in a smaller quantity.
2;You can buy 48 liters of this for $48 @ Dollartree;You can buy this stuff in many dollar sores for a buck each, for sure Dollartree.  The juice is pretty good, we use it for making peach iced tea, 1 container of this to 4 gallons of sweet tea, and wallah.
5;Favorite of my dog's food;This is, by far, the favorite of my dogs canned food(one of the more expensive, of course).  If I want to be sure she is eating, I just put this down.
2;Toy Survived-Treat Didn't;Spent $20 thinking this would keep my dog entertained for a little while.  Within a few minutes she had removed the treat from the ball and was happily munching away on it.
4;teste okay, but I think more healthier;teste okay, but I think this is more healthier, especially for some drink. I hope can find some good one for cooking.
5;True love;My boyfriend has been making Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans (6.4 oz) about 3 times a week for the last 10 years.
5;JMac;Coffee is excellent.  The K-Cup is different in that a filter is at the bottom and really provides a great taste.
4;Seemed to work in a mild, sustained way;Most energy drinks like Rockstar, Red Bull, and Monster don't seem to do much for me other than at best make me jittery for a bit, but the problem is they seem to cause a big crash after just a short period. I have tried some of the other energy shot brands, and they just didn't seem to do anything to give me more energy or keep me awake.
5;Very tasty and healty...;I really enjoyed this flavor. I bought them to take on a road trip and it really hit the spot.
4;Very good;Nice, smoky flavor to it. Not too strong, not too weak.
5;Love it this flavor!!!;I have tried other coffee flavors, but this my favorite flavor.  I love the taste of almond in this coffee.
1;No thanks....;I've been craving some good taffy for a while, and decided to order this mix. When it arrived the whole bag was rock hard, definitely way too old to be sold, and not what any taffy lover would expect.
5;YUMMY!;Very good and taste homemade.  Large Brownies and individually wrapped.
4;Tasty!;"This may not be ""real"" cappuccino, but I am not sure I know what that is.  This tastes good and I really enjoy a cup of it, especially on these chilly mornings."
5;One of my favorites;I read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try. It's now one of my favorites and I will be ordering it again.
4;The Best;After 5 years with the Keurig, this is the best .  If you like a medium blend, it perfect.
5;Fabulous!;I was introduced to Emily's chocolate covered dried fruit and nuts when my friend gave me some as a gift. Now it's my new favorite candy.
4;Tasty, but chalky after taste.;I ordered this when i was overseas, because i missed the Starbucks Frapp. so much.
5;Bob's Red Mill Flax Seed - Excellent buy;Until recently a local health & nutrition store carried Bob's Red Mill products, no one else has it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and even happier when I saw the price.
3;much cheaper $12.99 at Costco store;my kids love these but I paid $22.24 for 24 bags on Amazon.
1;Suggested by Dr. Oz;This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better.
4;Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!;Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.
5;Great Coffee;Well we were looking for another coffee that would meet or exceed the k cups we were using and this has far out tasted the coffee cups we were using, I have bought almost 6 packages of these and used just about all of them and will be ordering a few more boxes here soon. Great coffee, from a regular guy point of view.
3;they are ok!;i usually love spicy chips..
1;Lost flavor;The flavor didn't even last two minutes.  I didn't expect it to last long but less than two minutes!  Total waste of money.
5;It'd Be More Stars If I Could;Best coffee out there! Not sure I should be saying that because it's hard enough to find it as it is without all you savvy shoppers snapping it all up on me..
5;Delicious;This tea is a delicious healthy beverage that I love to drink before bed. I use one teaspoon for a pot of tea and steep it for 30 minutes, its sooting taste and aroma helps me relax after a long day.
5;Award winning Riesling/Traminer;I have purchased many of these wine kits. They are a good value for an everyday table wine.
5;Nice Assortment!;Well, it may be the luck of the draw, but, I thought my assortment was quite nice.<br />5 different brands
4;Cheaper to buy at the store;Tastes great. But it's cheaper to get it at the local store.
3;Cereal was stale, expiration date almost invisible;"Cereal with nuts and no preservatives can develop a rancid taste pretty quickly if it's not consumed before the ""sell by"" date.<br /><br />Unfortunately the order we received from Amazon was over two months past its expiration date, and it noticeably tasted stale."
5;The best;Nothing else out there that can compare to the Old El Paso enchilada<br />sauce. I use it to season soups, make enchilada even in my homemade<br />salsa.
5;Silky smooth taste???;I had to laugh at the product description. Those are the words to describe certain chocolates, not a water! Still, as a bit of a water taste snob, this is indeed great tasting water.
5;Perfect to the last drop;My coffee pot broke and I haven't bought another one yet.  Folgers instant is the next best thing for brewed coffee.
3;Taste is spot;It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.
5;Love it;This popcorn is sweeter and more flavorful than the cheapo brand we used to buy at the store. I'm hooked.
5;Great Bread!!;"This bread is the answer for my husband's ""NEED"" for bread. I also add different herbs and spices for some change."
5;SunButter Natural Sunflower Seed Spread;I purchased this product in two cases since I found it here on Amazon.com at an amazingly lower price than I had been paying for it at the Health Food Store in my area.
5;My teenagers and I love these beans!;The kids made these beans for the first time today.  They added some salsa for extra flavor.
5;A life staple!;I have been drinking a scoop of this stuff daily for a few months now. The first time I drank it, I mixed it with a small amount of pomegranate juice (~4oz) and could barely get it down.
2;So overated;I usually do not feel mislead by reviews but this is one of the few.  This is very mediocre cocoa powder but nothing mediocre about the premium price.
5;Delicious Red Head Wild Sockeye Salmon!!!!!;I just received my order of canned Red Head Wild Sockeye Salmon few minutes ago and couldn't wait to taste it and WOW..
5;A better dog food;I've been feeding this to my dog for a few weeks now. I see more energy from my older dog.
1;jablum dont buy it;My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.
5;scharffen berger makes the best milk chocolate bar;right mixture of sweetness and bitterness. Perfect texture.
5;Manuka Honey;The honey tastes great.  Not sure if it helped my GERD, but one has to be careful about ingesting too much sugar if one has a tendency to have sugar imbalance.
5;Tastes Better Than Original;I was hesitant to try Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, Honey Almond Flax, as the original Kashi GOLEAN Crunch wasn't that great. Luckily, I took a chance and discovered that this is a great cereal! As with all of the Kashi cereals, you are sure to have a high level of nutrition.
5;Good product;This is a good product.<br />As it becomes increasingly difficult to find anchovy paste in store, this is a convenient way to shop.
5;Way better than Swiss Miss diet cocoa;I don't know why or how this one can taste so much better than Swiss Miss, but the Nestle fat free is my fave.  It also dissolves much better.
4;Chicken of the Sea Sardines;I used to buy the 3.5oz Chicken of the Sea Sardines that cost around $!.
4;Sno Ball love this but...;My cat Sno Ball love this food and I like the fact that it is grain free and all natural. I highly recommend this product but just keep in mind that since most domestic cats are used to processed kitty food, it may take them a while to get used to it.
5;Nutia Coconut Oil;We have used it for popping our popcorn and it taste great.  This is the first coconut oil we have used and we do like it better than other oils.
5;Excellent Quality at GREAT Price;I have tried quite a few different brands of Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil and this has got to be one of the best.  I use it for everything.
1;Terrible coffee;This coffee is horrible and unfortunately not eligible for return. It tastes like burnt wood shavings.
5;Pug loves it!;We have an almost 2 year old female pug. We had tried several dog foods before such as Purina Fit and Trim, Kibbles 'N Bits, and even tried the Royal Canin food specifically for pugs.
5;perfect noodles;When the grocery stores here (NM) stopped carrying these I asked friends to ship them to me. I was delighted to be able to find them on line.
5;Sweet Coconut Flavored Tea;This tea has a nice light coconut flavor.  It's hard to find in the stores where I live so purchaing it at Amazon makes sense.
4;Improvement;I switched from a leading dog food that you can get in the grocery store.  My dog is 10 years old and have some gas problems.
5;Excellent!;I love that green mountain has made blueberry K cups
5;simply outstanding;Shaved coconut, mushrooms, baby corn, lemon grass, bamboo shoots and a perfectly balanced flavor profile. It is made with whole Thai chiles, however, which give it a lite bite, so you might want to keep an eye out for them.
5;i love this stuff;I just love Knorr Hunter Schnitzel Mix.  I find it very hard to find in grocery stores.
1;bad;I am from England, I know the product. When I recieved the product it was stale.
4;hot sauce;This is a good but not great hot sauce. There is not much taste of chili or lime.
5;Best I ever had;This kind of Ramen can't be compared to the cheap 50 cent one you get in your local supermarket..
3;Too Sweet;Good malt taste but way too sweet. Chronic drinkers will have big dental expenses.
1;"""Soft & Moist?""  HARD AS A ROCK!";I ordered some in June HARD AS A ROCK, had to ship pieces off for my dogs. NOT AS ADVERTISED.
5;Great Buy for Organic Black Tea;This is a good all around mild black tea.  I trust the Newman's Own Organics label.
5;Great stuff!;It works and pomegranate & grape taste good too.<br />Delivery & cost were excellent as well.
5;Delicious Sesame Snacks;These are just delicious! For me, this is perfect snack for a long day. Also, these ARE gluten free.
4;Great Product;My pet sitter recommended this product to me. I always trust her and sure enough, it's a keeper.
5;good stuff;Rinse with baking soda just before using.  Makes them taste like artichokes.
5;Best salt around!;This salt is great! Not meant as a cooking salt, this is to be sprinkled on food as a finishing salt. It gives a wonderful salty taste to nearly anything, even if little or no salt is used in preparation.
3;Passable for tree huggers;I will preface my comments by saying that, while not a coffee snob, I am a coffee enthusiast (I enjoy reading about coffee, roasting it, grinding it, trying different methods of brewing it, etc.).
5;Best Pod coffee I have tried yet!;I have tried Senseo and Wolfgang Puck medium roast blends and this product surpasses those brands for aroma, flavor and overall taste satisfaction.  Perhaps there are others that are its equal or better that I haven't tried, but this one is very satisfactory for me.
5;Unbelievably Great;My now 14-month-old son stopped liking pureed foods at about 9-10 months, but he is devouring the Happy Tot pouches, even this one with spinach.  He squeals when he sees them and can suck the pouch clean.
5;Love this movie!;Love watching this movie over and over again. Just had a group of 13 & 14 years old kids over and they also enjoyed this movie.
5;Nanas cookies;The most awesome cookies on the planet. We need a treat that is not full of sugar and Nanas fits the bill for us.
4;Pretty good, but a little too dry.;This stuff is pretty good, but kind of dry, giving a leathery texture---thus 4 stars instead of 5.  A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).
5;Refreshing flavorful tea and a great price;It is hard to find the Connamon flavor at many grocery markets.  And buying the tea this way is cost effective, plus you still get the presentation of each tea bag wrapped in its own pouch.
5;Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut K-Cup Coffee;Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut Coffee for Keurig brewer.  Good medium strength coffee with Hazelnut flavor.
5;Wonderful salmon at a great price!;This smoked salmon is without a doubt the best smoked salmon I've ever had. The salmon tastes as fresh as the salmon I ate while on vacation in Alaska.
5;Delicious!;"""OMG, OMG, aspartame!"" - Everyone<br /><br />Holy cow, who cares?! ""Oh, well there are so many known side-effects! There's no link to cancer YET, but I guess we'll continue to spend time and money into finding one!!!""<br /><br />The sun has side effects, caffeine has side effects, society has side-effects! Who cares!?! Somethin's gonna' kill you anyway!<br /><br />[ahem] This stuff is awesome! Delicious! And if it makes me forget even for a short period of time that there's a pooh-pond across the road where I live (down range), I'll take a little aspartame.."
1;"Terrible packaging of ""new"" boxes allows boxes to burst!";"This is a great product but it is now in a ""new"" box different from the one shown.  4 of the ""new"" boxes burst  during shipping because the packaging did not adequately protect its vulnerabilities."
1;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!;I purchased this product both for my dog and my daughters dog and it gave them both extreme diarrhea, explosive poor pups couldn't even make it out of the house. VERY embarrassed dogs!!! Both dogs suffered from this product.
5;Great for a busy beagle!;Well, I wasn't sure about this toy, what with the mixed reviews, but Wilson the Beagle was all out of toys so we had to get him something. He's terrible about destroying soft toys.
4;It is better than I expected;I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected.
5;Good Flavor, Good Nutrition;My baby loved this variety pack of Earth's Best baby food. I was afraid she might not like the prune flavor, but when I gave it to her, she ate it without a fuss.
5;Dubble Bubble Gumball Machine well worth the money;Bought this item for my 5 and 8 year old kids for Christmas.  They love it.
2;So little for the money;For the price, there should of been a bigger boxes or more boxes. It isn't anything like I thought it would be or like the product at Universal Studios.
4;"Good oil, but raw foodists beware ""extra virgin"" is not the same as raw!";This oil is extra virgin, but not raw. It is cold-pressed, but the processing tempurature rises above that of truly raw foods.
3;Quite a Tasty Tandoori;I used this product to create Tandoori chiken - which I marinated in yoghurt and this paste, and then cooked it on the barbeque for maximum flavour. I have always used Sharwoods Medium Tandoori Paste, however I could not find this product in the USA.
3;Interesting beverage, but I'll pass on a second cup;I read many of the reviews on this product before deciding to give it a try myself. I enjoy both lemon and ginger, so I thought there would be a fair chance that I would like this beverage.
5;Green Jalapeno sauce;We first tasted this yummy sauce in Boston at the Boylston street burrito place.  We dumped it into our burritos and it made a delicious burrito even better.
4;Great tasting oatmeal;"I'll admit, until recently I didn't even understand what ""Irish oatmeal"" was. In case you don't either, here's a quick explanation."
3;Good ice cream topping;I'd say this a fair to good ice cream topping - chocolate with some fresh raspberries mixed in.  It only really gets 3 stars for two reasons.
2;GREAT on popcorn!;Try this on popcorn. It is very good! I bought mine direct from Bell Plantation.
5;Refrigerate after opening!;Although the package says to refrigerate after opening, I didn't notice this, and my first package started to get moldy. My second, in the fridge, lasted a long while.
5;Perfect Porridge;Easy to prepare in Microwave and tastes  great.  Each packet has a fruit flavor.
5;Kitten loves it.;We have a somewhat finicky 5 month old kitten.  He hates most of the canned kitten food available, including other Science Diet canned kitten food.
5;splenda mini tabs;Splenda mini tabs are impossible to find anymore in grocery stores,dept stores,or drug stores.  Thank you for providing these mini tabs.
5;fun and delicious~!;I love this candy, I use to eat it all the time when I was little~!<br /><br />as you may know, the name 'abra cabubble' is a play on words 'abra cadabra', because it's like magic! &lt
5;Perfect movie-style popcorn;"Why go to the movies, when you can enjoy movie-style popcorn in your ""man-room?""  Popcorn pops perfect every time.  It even tastes good a few days later."
1;Is this food?;This is for the regular flavor..
5;MIRACLE SO FAR....;I have 3 very spoiled little dogs, all long-haired breeds, which include 2 very schiz-ee Havanese.  My youngest Havanese has hated, HATED, grooming since she was a puppy.
5;Great treat for a picky dog!;Our dog often turns her nose up at treats.  She is very particular about what she eats and she LOVES these!  She does prefer certain flavors, but she eats all of them.
2;ok gummies;my bag was not very fresh at all,i have all gummy products and this is my only bad purchase,i love when its fresh these are like almost hard..
1;horrible sugar free candy;this cherry sf candy has no flavor at all. It is a total waste calories.
1;waste of money;i gave up my wonderful cup of morning coffee because i like it with cream [i need neither the calories nor the estrogen] and switched to a pot of tea in the morning. with skim milk, its ok.
5;Excellent Low Sugar Sweet Treat;This almond product is wonderful!  I am so excited to have healthy options that curb my sweet tooth.  It has on 5 sugars for an ounce of almonds.
4;Wonderful - Great rainy day lunch!;I buy these for my elderly grandfather who needs to watch his salt and fat intake.  He loves them and I know he is eating lunch everyday because they are easy for him to manage.
5;Time Honored;How could you go wrong with a time honored candy that we all grew up with and loved.  I love long boys and the great coconut taste.
2;Another Brand is Better;There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online.  Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation.
3;Poor packaging;I purchased a 15 pound package of this food and when it arrived the bag was broken inside the box that it was shipped in.  My concern is that this could get contaminated.
5;Blair's Death Rain Chips;These chips are the hottest I have ever tried so far. At first they taste like a normal kettle cooked chip but then you feel the burn.
5;For cakes and other desserts--great flavor + great deal!;Betty Crocker frosting is consistently tasty and the perfect creamy texture.  You can buy this via an Amazon subscription and REALLY save with the Prime free shipping and having it delivered to your home (or office!).
5;Finally!  A nutritionally balanced GRAIN-FREE dry cat food!!;It is a huge breakthrough for a pet food manufacturer to develop a nutritionally balanced dry cat food formula that is high in protein and very low in carbohydrates.  The best part is that all five of my cats love it.
5;Easy mulling;I love cider, but after a friend told me about this mulling spice I was hooked.  I tried to find it at my local store, but all I ended up getting was the kind you use like a tea bag.
1;What a Bust;I have ordered this product twice. The product tastes fine.
5;be aware of teh blonde;I am diabetic..
5;Sweetener with no aftertaste;This sweetener was purchased for use while on a sugar free diet.  I found it to be as claimed in the descriptions: a direct substitute for white sugar with similar potency.
2;Let me be blunt;
5;My Dogs love them!;My dogs love these treats. I like them because they are good for them and don't contain any strange ingredients.
5;Caribou rates #1;I concur with the prior reviewers and independently came to the same conclusion. After going through everything in the variety pak, this particular coffee consistently came out on top.
4;Loved by all, curse my luck;I can't review these cookies completely honestly: my family ate them all before I even got home on the day they arrived. On the other hand, that's a pretty strong recommendation, don't you think?<br /><br />By all accounts -- there were three greedy family members (not including me!) who got to eat these fudgy, chewy cookies -- they were entirely satisfying and quite tasty, and I have to believe them.
5;Favorite Skittles!;These are my favorite flavor of Skittles. I was tired of going to the gas station whenever I was having a craving for them, so I decided to buy an entire box instead.
5;worth every bite;after trying these chips for the first time I have reordered them several times. other who have tried at my home have ordered them .
5;Nice and strong;Nice to have found a decaf coffee with a strong flavor. I make my coffee using the smallest cup setting on my Keurig.
1;Ehh;I was really excited to try this. Saw it at a gas station and picked it up along with the neuro bliss.
5;Really, REALLY black!;I read the previous reviews of AmeriColor's Super Black icing coloring and decided to give it a try to make my daughter's zebra-striped birthday cake. I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!).
5;High Quality Product;Bought this based on food blog recommendation.  Used it experimentally in a beef/pork chili in the slow cooker.
1;Great product...just not in small packages!;I love Terra chips..
5;A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!;Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.
2;Not like the ones I'm used to...;Realize that tastes are very subjective, so what I like, others might not.  With that said, these nuts do not have what I call a jalapeno flavor at all.
5;My dog loves them, and they are safe.;This specific product was never on the recall list of products with a known problem.<br />I have been giving them to my dog for 4 years+ and he is the healthiest dog my vet has ever seen.
5;I am an Americolor convert!;When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton.  I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton.
5;Not quite magic, but close!;My mother is a huge believer in home remedies, in herbs and plants to help soothe away your aches and pains. Burn your hand? Break off a bit of the aloe plant.
5;great assortment;I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig.  Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so, but this is definitely better.
2;Not as good as they used to be ...;This used to be a wonderfully flavored, handy product. Something has gone awry in the last 6 months.
5;My Bunny Goes Nuts For These;My bunny loves her yogurt yummies.  They're simply timothy hay pellets coated in different flavors of yogurt.
5;My favorite coffee. Very rich and full flavored.;One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste.
5;Much better buy than the store!;We have trouble finding this product on the shelves of grocery stores.  What an amazing find!  Our favorite pork rub, in an amount that will last many times, not just one.
5;Tastes great, less filling, no aftertaste;Briefly:<br /><br />- taste is VERY close to sugar's<br />- no aftertaste<br />- no known adverse side effects<br />- one packet is the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar<br />- zero calories<br /><br />I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste.
5;My dog is obsessed with this ball;I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.
5;Judy's Peanut Brittle Review;The peanut brittle is very good. Some of the best I have tasted, including sugar based varieties.
5;Good Old Stand By;When you have someone who doesn't like the fresh cheese (KIDS) this is great.  I use it mostly for a recipe for cheese bread, therefore this was a good deal.
5;The genuine stuff!;This is the genuine stuff imported from Sweden. It's one of the best known brands for jam and holds a high quality.
4;Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillet Kit;The prep on this item is super easy, requiring only about 15-20 minutes of my time to create a full meal for two. So that's pretty awesome.
5;Awesome product;I just bought wheatgrass powder yesterday and I have to say I have experienced immediate results. I did a ton of research on it and everything seemed safe and beneficial, so I figured I would try it out.
4;Pretty good...;says my husband, who I bought this for. It was a deal of the day.
5;Fantastic snack!;I enjoy these so much more than traditional (fried) banana chips.  They do really stick to your teeth a lot, but it's as sweet as candy (even without added sugar) so I wouldn't consider that a huge detriment.
5;Tea lover;Ordered this tea mainly for holiday gifts and myself.  Everyone that received this tea loved it, particularly the peppermint spice and chamomile.
3;Good for the most part;The first time I got this it was amazing and it went extremely well with popcorn. The second time, about half of them were completely messed up.
4;a little smokier than most kimchee but still tasty;I bought this and slathered it on wilted salted napa cabbage, with scallions, ginger, and a litle chili paste added in. It wasn't as good as Korean store-bought Kimchee but it was better than big grocery store chain versions.
5;Skinless & Boneless Sardines;The Crown Prince Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Olive Oil are especially tasty and a gourmet treat. Priced very fairly for the fine product.
5;As good as I remembered;There isn't much to say when reviewing a candy that you like.  If you like them, you like them.
4;Expensive, but good;A little pricey, but good quality.  I only wish there was a little more, as it only makes about 3/4 cup.
2;Mediocre at Best;not impressed with the flavors of these syrups.  not worth the premium price tag for sure.
5;excellent product;Bob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4) (Purchased on July 2, 2012)<br />This product is quality from the first time you make to the next time it is made<br />all you have to do is follow the easy instructions on the packaging and it will be perfect and the price is the best cost I have had, will buy more in the future..
4;great tea;really like this! i put this in my cold water and it's great..
5;Dried fruit;I must say these blueberries are just great!  Not too sweet or oily.  They will be a wonderful addition to my home made trail mix.
4;It was ok;It is not as sweet as I thought it would be for a Grade B syrup but good maple flavor and dark amber color.  I got two jugs, one for me and one for a gift.
4;Great tea for a decent price;This is good quality, strong black tea. The tin is smaller than you'd expect, but each one does hold a full 1/4 pound because the tea is so finely cut.
5;Excellent;the tea is very good with honey and I have seen a difference. I have lost 3lbs since taking it.
5;OMG--these tins are HUGE!!!;I love Coleman's Mustard.  It adds a hearty kick to sauces and marinades and can double for Chinese mustard.
5;Puppy's Favorite Treat;My 7 month old Wheaten has been enjoying these treats since he was 2-1/2 months old and never seems to tire of them as he has with other products.  He gets one every day and anxiously looks forward as I put one in his Kong for him to relish.
5;Great!;Best canned chili I've ever had - like my mom's. I sometimes add some of Jardiine's Ole Chipotle salsa to give it some extra *bite*.
5;Great tea...;This is the best red rooibos tea I have found!! Recommend it to all my friends..
5;They're great!;I've loved these things for decades and for some reason no one in my area carried them. For 15 to 20 years (yes I'm serious) I've been looking for them in ever food store I've been to.
5;Tastes exactly like what I get when I cut into a young coconut;I really love this one..
1;HOAX?~~~~!!!!;I had  purchased 4 doz roses for my wife for Valentines Day. They told me they had made a price mistake and wanted to charge me 3x the amount of money.
5;She loves Gummy Bears!;This was a no brainer for my pregnant daughter!  When those cravings kicked in, she had plenty of treats!  Also used them for snacks with lunches.  Buy baggies to sort in individual serving sizes.
5;one word...WOW;I work at a nutrition shop that sells protein bars/protein and other supplements, and i got to say..
5;Lovely color, great to work with;The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.
1;bayside candy Jordan Almonds you get what you pay for!;Do not know what everyone is raving about concerning these almonds but the ones I received today and just returned back were horrible. They arrived cracked chipped and totally broken.
5;Works every time;I've made 6-10 batches of bread with this yeast so far.  It's been easy to work with and has resulted in big, beautiful loaves each time.
2;Not very flavorful.  BUT......;I was really surprised when I looked online and saw that I only found positive reviews about these things!!!!  Quite frankly, I found the orange flavor weak, and it tasted just like the regular orange flavor, except worse.  I can't tell the difference between these and other orange candies, but they are a bit bitter, and again, the orange flavor is rather weak.
4;Colour Repair Shamphoo;My hair is short, regularly coloured and I use shampoo and conditioners specificly for coloured hair.<br />The first time I used this I didn't use a conditioner and towel dried my hair, to be able to see the effectiveness of this product.
5;Great low-carb bagels;I've tried several other brands of low-carb breads and they were flavorless with an odd texture.  Carb Krunchers breads  are great - they freeze well and hold up well in the freezer (don't become soggy when they thaw).
5;nice taste;These are good right out of the bag.  Haven't cooked with them yet.
5;Super Finicky Cat Loves It!;This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food.
5;omg Delish!;these bars are very filling and very tasty!  I originally found them at Marshalls and was thrilled to find them in bulk here on amazon.com.
3;So-so, prefer the grocery store version;Tried it, why not? Not so good. Prefer the grocery store version.
5;Great product!;This is the only formula that I've given to my baby that she doesn't spit up on. Amazon has the best prise and the 4 pack makes it very convienient to get.
5;Delicious and great price;These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.
5;"""top shelf"" jam";I was served this jam at breakfast in a hotel near Niagara on the Lake and liked it so much that I bought some at their in-town store. Also bought the apricot and the triple berry, all are superior in quality to what you'd typically find in the supermarket.
5;great trick and delicious for ribs or brisket.;I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).
4;Not the ones I got in Germany recently, but....;I ate them all anyway.  There are new flavors for gummi bears that I got in Germany in October and these were not the same, so I was a little disappointed.
4;Hot Cocoa;I like the taste of chocolate and mint. It mixed well when I added Hot water.
5;Great Smell and Tastes Just As Good.;I don't drink regular coffee at all and rarely drink the flavored.<br /><br />This one was delicious.
4;Does Seem to Moisturize Scalp;It's summer and the kids and I have been swimming almost every day, and our hair sort of shows it.  However it wasn't until two nights ago, the day of the arrival of my shampoo and conditioner samples, that my 10 year-old son freaked out and began seriously complaining that his scalp was burning and itching.
4;Great Product - Too Expensive!;I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.
5;Got my Halloween candy, without the Halloween crowds;Amazon had some great candy deals right before Halloween, so I placed an order for several assorted chocolate bars.  Baby Ruth happens to be one of my favorites so of course they were part of my order.
5;Whole Wheat Orzo Tasty and Versatile;Hard to find whole wheat orzo in supermarket, happy to find it on Amazon. Tasty in hot soup, as a main or side dish with vegetables, seafood or meat.
5;simply amazing. :);IMPORTANT: DRINK PLENTY OF WATER (if you plan on taking this continually) This has 2000% of your daily intake of Vitamin B and, believe it or not, you can overdose on vitamins. Side effects of overdosing? Headache, dizziness, fainting, etc.
5;My dog loves this food!;My dog really loves this food. He's a picky eater and I find he really likes this one.
5;Excellent;I love 5hour Energy. It works just like it is advertised
1;"A ""fake"" product - no longer healthy!";This product IS NOT the original. It does NOT contain the vitamins and minerals that made it famous and healthy, for years.
5;Kahve Koffee's Cordoba Blend is the reason I get up in the morning;Since I switched to Kahve Koffee's brand of gourmet coffees, I now have a reason to look forward to waking up in the morning.  Like a faithful alarm clock, the thought of getting up to make my coffee beckons me.
4;Yum!;Salty, crunchy, healthy
5;Delicious cereal, horrible price;I love this cereal.  Essentially, if you like Raisin Bran but don't always love the fact that it surrenders to milk easily then this is your solution.
4;Orange Soda Flavor with Real Fruit Juice;If you love orange soda but don't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.
5;Fresh. Convenient. Portion controlled.;I love pistachios, so I can get carried away when eating them. These, however, allow me to enjoy them a little at a time.
4;PG Tips Decaf Black Tea;When black tea is decaffeinated, it often tastes weak and thin. Some companies add chicory to counter this problem, but to me this makes the tea tastes like bad coffee.
5;Really works for hayfever (allergies)...;Was told by a friend to try Nettle tea for allergies. Brought it & it works great & quickly.
5;Wonderful and healthy product!;This Zico coconut water, in three flavors, is absolutely sensational! Until it is available in my area, I definitely will order more of this healthy product. The best drink discovery of my life! Excellent taste, fast delivery, good for me.
4;nice rice crackers;"We do not eat wheat and most brands of rice crackers are a lot more expensive than these were.  They are just a bit on the sweet side, rather than the salty flavor one expects from a ""cracker""."
5;Oreos always win;I got these when they were priced at $15 for a pack of 48..
5;Lapsang Souchong tea.;This<br /> is my favorite tea but is unavailable here since Ukrops closed. It is a smoky tea.
2;Dry Cookie Bits, and Bits and More Bits;These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.
4;Trio bars bby Mrs, May...;I really like these nut filled health bars.  In the past I could only find them at my local wearhouse store so I went looking on line.
4;Satisfies a sweet potato tooth;Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.
5;The best meat barbecue seasoning made;I first used this in SoCal and have been looking for it again for 6 years since I moved to Northern California.  No luck
3;flavor just okay;Cookies look good, taste is almost non-existent. I vote for PAmela's Chocolate chunk cookies over these.
5;Great substitute for sugar;I am already a fan of Splenda, I think it tastes just like sugar without all the calories.  I use it in coffee, tea and fresh lemonade.
4;Coffee to take with you;These are those little coffee pouches that you get at a motel where they have single cup drip coffee makers. Alternatively, you can add hot water to a cup and mess with the pouch with a spoon, use a French press, or a small drip coffee maker.
5;Twinings Green Tea;this tea is not only good for us but is a wonderful beverage..
5;Amazing!;The coffee was SO good! Cafe Vita is my favorite coffee roaster. All the items were shipped the next day too, which is a plus since I can't survive for long in college without coffee.
1;Worst Tea Ever!;Sorry to say, but need to warn others that this tea is tasteless, like it wasn't properly made.  It is so bad that we can't drink it, tastes like tea colored water without the tea flavor.
1;Not an improvement at all!!;While the bowl may be a nice feature, the pop corn didn't cook the way it's supposed to.  I know from much experience how the popping is supposed to sound when it's done, but when it slowed down enough and I took it out, much of the popcorn was charred.
5;Love it!;I love this product! I have several of these that I got for my daughter. She makes her own baby food for our grandchildren.
5;Best Catfood;My cat is picky.  He also gets an upset stomach over other varieties of cat food.
3;Interesting Flavor;Have to get use to the hot watery chocolate taste, so unlike what one is accustomed to, a thick creamy drink. My suggestion is to use a sparkling water for a cool beverage and double the brew.
4;Great product but it majorly leaked during shipment;Great tasty product and great price, but Roland has a packaging problem with the pail which had cracked and seemed too weak for the contents.<br /><br />The top of the pail was completely snapped off and the protective foil seal burst open during transit - the entire glaze contents spilled out like slime - Fed-X wrapped the box in a plastic bag to prevent further leakage.
1;Brown Rice Balls Dog Treat in 16 oz.Plastic Containers;I have purchased this product many many times and have never ever had a problem with it.  These are the only dog treats my dog loves.
2;Broken Top...;I just received my order in the mail and was unhappy to find that the top to my coconut oil was missing. Thank god the coconut oil is at a solid, because the oil would be ever where.
5;If you like bold coffee;I like strong coffee and usually dislike the pre-measured pods, etc. because the result is a lame brew.
5;wicked tasty;I like to be able to offer coffee to my clients, or tea, so a Keurig coffee maker has become a tattoo studio essential. This tasty flavor means I don't have to keep half&half or creamer on hand, you get a perfect mild creamy brew instantly.
5;Great afternoon snack;In the afternoon when I need a boost to get me through work and home to dinner I have a bar and it really helps.  I don't know how they work, but they really make a difference in keeping my blood sugar stable.
5;1 Year Old's Favorite!;My 1 year old loves these pouches.  We normally buy this blend (which is my daughter's favorite!), the spinach and the green bean blends.
5;Better than Slim Jim;This is much better than a slim jim. These are softer and have a good snap when you take a bite.
5;I am hooked on this coffee;There may be a need to start a 12-step program for this coffee.  :)<br /><br />I do not usually like flavored coffees but I am so glad that I tried this one.
5;THE BEST!;I have a dog who until we adopted her never had oral care,so her teeth were in bad shape. We brush her teeth every 3 weeks and give her 1 booda bone weekly .
5;"Best tasting ""instant"" oatmeal";I have tried many kinds of instant oatmeal. This is the best in my opinion.
5;Best I've found;I've tried about every sun dried tomato product I can find locally. And these are by far the best.
4;Awesome!;Now, I've had these cookies before and they are pretty good, but have a bit of a sandy after-taste. However, my son with multiple food allergies LOVES thems and would eat as many as I'd let him.
4;Decent Set of Flavors But;You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.
3;Not easy to dissolve, but the baby's poop is less smelly;I follow the instruction to use warm water for this formula, however, it's not easy to dissolve. Will be a little bit of powder that will clog the nipple.
4;Great Toy For A Big Dog;My dog loves to play with this item.  He smells the treats inside and keeps having fun getting his treat and I will get more toys like this for my dog.
5;Great Product;I was very hesitant to try this.  I was afraid how it might taste.
2;Not the same;I have purchased other 5 spice powders but this one is a poor knockoff of it. It tasted too much like cinnamon when it should not be overpowered by it.
3;Great for slowing down feeding time!;This is a super easy puzzle it took my standard poodle who is about 6 months old about 3 minutes to figure it out the very first time. So I don't think it makes the best puzzle, but it is amazing at slowing down chow time.
4;Star Spinner Treat Game A Hit;I have two dogs that received this gift from Santa and figured it out pretty quick since Santa pre-filled it. They play with it until it is empty.
4;Earth Organic Dates;Very good dates. I have tried very moist, rich medjool organic dates, if anyone know a brand like that please comment.
5;Grea taste;I eat these for a snack during the day. Just plain out if the box.
5;Worth the price;Very few things are better than a GREAT cup of coffee. Marley coffee , although pricey , very much hits that mark.
5;Wow!;Wow is what you'll say when chomping on these nuts.  They're very tasty and addictive, as stated in the other reviews.
5;Wonderful coffee!!!;We love this medium full-flavored roast. Very smooth taste.
5;Best ever;Glad I gave them a try. They are expensive, but all gluten free foods I purchase are! They taste the closest to the best cookies I used to purchase before having to go gluten-free.
5;Great cookies!;These cookies go back to when I was in school many years ago. I haven't had them since school because I didn't know where to find them.
5;Great little juniper bonsai!;This is the first bonsai I have had shipped to me and I was quite suprised. The shipping was very quick.
5;Love it!;This is one of the best coffees in a K-cup I have had. It doesn't have that after bite that some full flavored coffees have.
5;Need help giving your cat medication...try these.;I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.
1;Very poor quality;I have been eating licorice for over 60 years. This licorice is more like candy.
5;Wonderful Color!!;(first off..
5;Citrus Is Important To Have with Green Tea;I could not find an online source to back this claim up but I did read in a health magazine that adding citrus to your green tea will increase the benefits of drinking such tea. This product is perfect to suit those needs.
1;Beware peanut allergy;I love ThinkThin bars, but just a warning here. There's no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts.
1;amish popcorn;worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.
5;Love the taste...........;My husband wanted this coffee maker, not me. I thought it was too expensive (still do) and the coffee was too expensive (still do).
5;"Excellent Allegy Free ""Candy""";While some of Larabars have a thick grainy-nut texture, this particular product is very smooth and almost tastes like chocolate candy. For those of us who can't eat real candy because of allergies, this one is a winner! It almost tastes like a soft Girl Scout thin mint cookie.
3;not my cup of coffee;This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and I'm sure that makes a difference.
4;Limon candy;"I gave ""Pica Limon Candy"" to my sister for her birthday. She used to eat it when she was a kid."
5;Coffee not Tea;I have always been a coffee drinker - tea was reserved for stomach troubles, but the hype about the benefits of green tea caught my attention.  The first time I drank green tea - well - Yuck!  It was like drinking dirty water.
4;Very Good Muesli;This is very good European Muesli, but I think Mestemacher Natural Forest is their best. This muesli has whole nuts, which I am not fond of eating.
5;Delicious!!;I am trying to avoid soda, and what better way than to drink The Switch.  100% juice but carbonated.
2;My cat won't eat them;Surprisingly enough given the near-unanimous positive reviews, my cat won't touch these treats. She sniffed it a few times and lost interest, without even giving it a lick.
5;Amazing;This is pretty much what you would expect as if you bought Slim Jims from the store. What is great about it is the price.
4;Great jerky!;The only vegetarian jerky I know of that has the texture and flavor like regular jerky. It looks and tastes more like spicy beef with a little mushroom flavor.
5;Delicious Cherries!;A friend of mine always brings me back a couple boxes of these cherries when they visit family in Michigan. These are the best dried cherries I've ever had.
1;dissolves;These things dissolve in drool very fast. The dog does not get any benafit from chewing because they are mush in minutes.
5;Best dog food!;This is by far the best dog food I've given my dog! I was having problems with my dog eating for almost a year before we started this dog food. She just wouldn't want to eat.
5;great organic tea at a great price;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;Horrible Packing;Glucosamine was highly recommended by a number of friends who own older dogs.  After reviewing most of the glucosamine dog products offered through Amazon, I decided on this one.
5;Greenies are good!;For the past 5 years my dog has been starting his day with a greenie.  He still gets excited about this morning treat and appears disappointed when I run out.
1;Horrible buy;To their credit, the product description has been updated to reflect that there are only 10 boxes included.  It was previously just listed as a total weight of 17 lbs which, if accurate, would have made this a good buy.
5;""" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""";I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician.
5;Great for gluten-free vegans;I use this in combination with pea protein powder.  I am not a body builder, just trying to get a little extra protein in my morning smoothies.
3;good not great;I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good.
5;Simply the best;These are simply the most delicious cookies I've ever tasted. I usually eat them with milk or coffee, even tough I know British use tea instead.
4;Mango Madness;This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.
4;Not my Favorite Harney & Sons;It's a green tea with a hint of cocnut, lemon grass, ginger & vanilla. I was expecting more of the flavours to come through but it's quite pleasant hot or cold.
2;"Should be called ""Tragic Shell""";I bought this product and another brand (very well known for their chocolate) and did a taste test.  The Smucker's brand was quite NASTY!  It doesn't even remotely taste like chocolate, and it doesn't harden like the other brand.
5;makes great finger jello!;I am totally satisfied, and then some, with this product..
3;Disappointed.;I love Jones soda and Berry Lemonade is my favorite by far.  So when I heard there was candy I went nuts to find some.
5;Kicken chicken rocks!;"My ""girls"" have been on ID from the Vet, so I was used to paying big bucks. But decided maybe what they needed was Organic food."
5;Awesome stuff!;First found this hot chocolate on the Museum of Natural History of all places. There's a great blend of sweetness and spice.
5;happiness is abba zaba;This is fabulous candy. This company shipped so fast I could not believe it.
3;gave me the jitters!;If you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race, this is not the coffee for you. It is quite flavorful, so I do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee.
5;Delish!;"LOVE this product! My boyfriend's mother was the one who ""turned me on"" to it and I'm glad I tried it. Some of the best olive oil I've ever had."
5;Healthy Cereal - Great Deal from Amazon;Great deal, from Amazon. Nature's Path, can be higher than $5.
4;Lawry's Perfect Blend Chicken/Poultry Seasoning & Rub;Good seasoning, lightly salted, no longer available at local grocery markets.  Recommended for seasoning chicken before barbequeing or for seasoning chicken used in salads.
5;Love;I care for a baby who absolutely loves these puffs. Perfect for his little hands and growing desire to feed himself.
5;I love the way these smell;I love eating these chips. They have a nice nostalgic smell that reminded me of my old grandpa's butt when he walked by.
5;Love this Tea;I dearly love this tea. I have been drinking it almost exclusively since I first had it back when Good Earth actually had restaurants here on teh west coast in teh '70's.
4;remember that powerded stuff for your milk....;Well when I was little I loved it hated milk but loved strawberry milk. This ceral reminds me of that.
5;so cute and useful!;i have only used these bags a couple of times, but each time someone gives me a compliment. they are very sturdy and are easy to carry on my shoulder when bringing in groceries.
2;Dissapointed...;Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Sour Power fan..
4;Perfect sampler for the coffee snob;I am really picky with coffee. I'd rather not drink it then drink a cup of weak, brown colored water.
5;ZEVIA REVIEW;I PLAN TO KICK SODAS.  THIS PRODUCT WILL LET ME GET AWAY FROM SUGAR AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WHILE I SLOWLY CHANGE MY DIET HABITS.
5;Solid Medium Roast Coffee with Just a Hint of Bold. Good Flavor. Not Acidic.;Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor.  Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.
5;Great for gym rats..;This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy.
2;Not the Best;I didn't expect this to be so spicy! It smells great but when you taste it, it's nasty! I sweetened it as much as I could but it just didn't help. This is a shame since I like so many other Yogi teas.
5;best coffee ever!;This is my favorite coffee outside of Italy. It is the only brand my husband and I drink.
5;Perfect;I read the book 'Water and Salt' several years ago which is why I began buying this wonderful salt. If you've ever researched salt, you'd find that typical white table salt in it's 'cleansed' state is a lifeless chemical.
1;There's Suppose to be Chicken in This, Really?;Where's the meat? I found these have nothing but the lesser than healthy filler of rice & bits of corn. THEN you find little traces of chicken & beans floating beneath a SEA of watery tomato-like broth.
4;Grandson loves it...;I got an order of this for myself, since it had such good reviews.  I didn't much care for it because it seemed bland.
1;Taste;Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor.
4;Great as a Topping Raw or as Noodles Cooked;In our home we strive to eat as many healthy raw foods as possible.  We encounter common challenges like eating out, school lunch, weight loss, etc.
3;I love this stuff on ice;started drinking it in France (menthe-a-lou) and got hooked.  good on ice with some water on a hot summer day.
3;"Just ""all right""";I got these thinking they seemed like a more respectable stand in for Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch which is my guilty pleasure cereal which I will hide from the kids and eat by the bucket once they are in bed.  The flavor is not as intense, and if you really compare the label, a 3/4 c.
1;My Cats Wouldn't Touch It;A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food.
5;Very happy with purchase;I was very happy with the quick delivery and how I was given a tracking method to determine where my Greenies were. I'll telling my friends and relatives about the good experience.
5;My cat dreams about these;Ever since receiving a few of these at the veterinarian's office to hide medicine in, my cat can't get enough! She loves them as treats anytime. Amazon.
3;CNI Ginseng Coffee;This product gives you a bit of a coffee hit with a satisfying flavour.  Unfortunately the package's first ingredients are sucrose and trans fat.
4;Nice first time kit.;This was my first attempt at home brewing. I selected this kit due to the fact that it seemed very easy and for my first batch, that is what I wanted.
2;Weak stuff;This was the strongest Ethical Coffee Company blend I could find on Amazon in Feb, 2012.  It's quite weak
5;Best deal around;I've been paying $6 for an 8 oz. bag so this is a great deal.
5;Hits the spot;I first tasted the Gold Kili ginger tea at a local Thai restaurant. I loved it and after ordering pot after pot asked the waiter what brand they used.
5;my cat thanks you;"Great packaging, price less than anywhere else, my cat likes this treat and literally ""rolls over"" in the corner where the treat bowl is kept. She mews until she gets a few morsels."
5;Great dog food.;Switched to Canidae from ScienceDiet after reading about dog foods on the internet.  I haven't noticed any major differences in the dogs habits or frequencies, other than her eating habits.
5;Yummy! A perfect snack;These Cranberry Almond Thins were offered as samples at Costco today, and I was instantly addicted! I immediately bought a package and it will not be my last. They are delicious! Not too sweet, crunchy, with cranberries adding tartness, and a almond slices adding almond flavor to the cookie.
5;Chocolate AND Peanut Butter ?!!;Now try another great marriage:  Aioli and Mustard!<br />Aioli (basically, garlic mayonnaise with a fancy label) is blended with a brown mustard that expands the versatility of this mild, creamy condiment (OK, I'm not a gourmet).  Not just for fish and pasta anymore - I love it with my Sunday weisswurst.
1;so disappointed;its first time write a review,ordered 5 boxes of them (120 packages), expiration till Jan.7 2012 only,and its not returnable.
5;I absolutely LOVE the taste ...;If this is as healthy as it claims to be, I can't imagine any reason not to buy it.  The taste is very light coconut flavor.
5;Yummy!!!;Loved them, they were awesome! I recieved them to an APO AE address 1 week after ordering. I have never had a package get here that fast.
1;Made in China;Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.
4;Cats' meow;The cats should love these little jars of different wet flavors, and even you cats who are accustomed to dry food should like this.  You feel like you're giving them something healthful and gourmet when you serve them this.
5;Otto likes it!;My small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as I mix it with some good people food. He hasnt had problems digesting it  Delivery was prompt as expected.
2;Cheaper at Wal-Mart;Found this item for $4 cheaper at Wal-Mart.  Was too late to cancel my order.
5;Much Love for it;I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.
4;Tasty tea with potential to help cure/avoid cancer!;Purchased this product based on researching the potential benefits related to cancer prevention and cancer cell eradication.  I'm currently giving the tea to my dad who has cancer in hopes that it will help him recover (he has stage 4 head and neck cancer).
5;Great Salt, Good price;I bought a pound of this salt and I love it.  It is a great finishing salt, very delicate and flavorful.
5;great product;I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.
5;Best packaged cookie ever!;I know..
5;Long-time Favourite Drink;San Pellegrino Aranciata has been a favourite drink of mine for years. I've never much been a soft drink fan, but I enjoy the combination of fruit juice and carbonation that Aranciata offers.
5;Tone's 19.5oz  WHOLE BLACK PEPPERCORN;Great value, love the large size 19.5 oz plastic container, love my pepper mills and use lots of whole peppercorns.
2;Love the idea, can't stand the smell!;My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.
4;Nice taste and of medicinal value;This is a HOT drink, spicy hot thanks to the ginger, but still a good pleasant lemony, honey sweetened taste.  I tried it as a morning wake-upper and while the one sample package probably won't inspire me to be a regular customer, I'll be looking for it when under the weather.
5;Good product at a good price.;Good product at a good price. The texture is excellent.
5;miracle indeed;this is a great product. i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it.
5;Best Stevia buy on the internet!;I have purchased the 1000/box several times and have never had a problem.  The product was always received promptly and there have never been any problems with the contents.
3;Good flavor, but bad pod quality;The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.
3;beware of subscription pricing on amazon;I absolutely love the Zico Coconut Water product, especially with the discounted pricing that appeared to be available on Amazon using the Subscription options. However, it turned out that the discounts that brought the price down to $1.
4;cats seem to like it;cats like it and they are the judges of the food. They like to try different products of dry food.
5;The real deal;I first tried Puerh tea 5 years ago and ever since was willing pay for the luxurious experience.<br />It's hard to describe like trying to explain what a truffle tastes like.
4;good happy lunch;this product is very nice and i am happy i found a way to purchase it. i was able to make a couple of healthy sized burgers from each box instead of the recommended '6' but i was very glad to not find any animal products in the ingredients.
5;Fluffy Popcorn;I love this popcorn.  It really does pop up nice and light and fluffy compared to the ones I've bought in the store.
5;Enjoyable new Product;Really good cookies.  But they're not quite cookies.
5;Wonderful, Indeed!;Oh, boy! I could tell these were going to be good when I cracked open the bag. What a nice aroma! I was right.
3;Okay but not Cake Mate;I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.
5;Drugs in a can.;I hunted this down because a local coffeehouse uses it in their sugar free mochas.<br /><br />This stuff is beyond good.
4;Pretty darn good!;I'd never tried caviar before so this was a first for me. While this brand may be filed under the inexpensive caviar list, nothing about the taste, smell or packaging seems cheap or under done.
5;I love this product.;I've bought this sausage casing. It was a great product.
5;great pasta;Of all the gluten free pasta's on the market, my husband likes this one best.  It is close enough to the real thing that I can get away serving this pasta to the whole family.
2;New formula - Texture STALE, many CRUMBS, downsized to 1.2 ounces.;I bought this product before they reformulated it, and of course now. This product has definitely changed for the worse.
4;Good, but a bit too sweet;Great, high- protein snack without meat.  I would give it 5 starts if it were not so sweet.
5;tasty and convenient;A good product.  A nice alternative to the cheese puffs from the other brands.
4;A good nut bar - not life changing, but good.;Planters has put together a tasty nut bar that contains peanuts, almonds, and cashews..
5;A tasty snack for the health conscious;I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar.
4;Popchips are great!;Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.
5;solid whiskey;Yamazaki is a well balanced single malt whiskey, for a fair price. Goes down smooth and finishes with a light smokiness.
1;If you like to throw your money away get this.;I was glad I found something we always had in Europe, well this can ended in the thrash quickly. I guess I just have to wait til I get back to find real chesnut puree.
4;My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!;My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled.
5;Very good, strong flavored, tangerine juice;More flavor than the stuff you find at Wal-Mart or such. As close to fresh as you can get without being in Italy on Mt.
5;"best dijon rated by ""Cooks Illustrated""";I READ THE REVIEW AND FOUND IT TO BE TRUE..
5;Best Deal for GREAT treats!;Zukes Hip Action are great treats for our dogs. Our Lab/Shep mix was already having hip troubles at 5yr.
1;Horrible, spend a lil more and get green mountain;I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand.
5;Christmas Cheer brought by Amazon's Penguin gift basket.;I sent this last minute gift as a cheerful holiday hello to a nice little family I've known for a long time. Their little boy is 5 years old.
3;Not Much More Than Canned Coffee;So a canned cappuccino? Okay. And it's pretty much what it is, a milk-flavored canned coffee with some sweetness to it.
5;Canned Kitty food;One of my cats developed a urinary tract infection that caused both of us great suffering.  Kitty was two years old and I had only ever fed her dry food.
5;Love all HappyBaby Tots!;My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.
4;Very tasty;This product is an alternative to eating granola bars. The only downside is that portion control is easy with a granola bar, whereas once you start eating this product out of the bag it is difficult not only to stop, but also to gauge how much you have eaten unless you first scoop out what you want, put it onto a plate, and weigh it on a food scale-- which I doubt most people will do.
5;zico;I love ZICO. I have Sjogrens and can get dehydrated very quickly.
5;Great Product;I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.
5;Can't beat PG Tipps;For serious tea drinkers..
1;This tea is too weak;I've been drinking Oolong tea several years and I was very disappointed in this brand of tea. The flavor is weak and the smoky essence is not detectable.
5;I like it;I really like the taste of this cappuccino.  Some complained that it's a waste because the k-cup is empty after it is brewed.
5;Get them free in your SP Pack;Yep I used to get them for free. All you had to do was go out into the field in Viet Nam (67-68).
5;Crunch. Wow!;Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.
1;Ick Tasted Rancid. Sent back.;Purchased the two pack. Opened one.
5;Dog goes wild for these;Not a perfect dental care item but helps and the dog just loves them.  She is normally a little excited when getting a treat but she is wild for these.
2;Not Absolutely Terrible, Not Great;Small, firm and pebble like, these are not the soft gummy type snacks that some may be more familiar with.  They are chewy with a slight grainy texture.
5;Candy Corns - bulk;These were listed as Brach's, which I dearly love. They taste like them, so I have no problems with that.
3;Crash was difficult to tolerate, maybe tornados?;The happy news:  Wednesday was 100 degrees and I felt exhausted and unable to focus on the 90-mile drive.  Experimented with 1 bottle of Orange at 2 p.
5;great breakfast;This is the best oatmeal that I have ever tasted.  Same as what is served in Europe and on the cruise ships.
4;5 stars on taste;5 stars on taste. Beef tastes like it was grilled before it was added to the chili.
5;Good low cal snack;This is a tasty low cal snack and the single serve bags are good for those who won't rest until the bag is empty.  If you need to watch your sodium this is not a low sodium food.
5;Excellent product, as advertised;It is exactly what it claims to be. I love using it, it has a great texture, and goes well with my shakes and breakfast cereal.
5;Love the quality & flavor!;This is our 4th time ordering the Navitas Organic Raw Cacao Nibs and we've been very happy with every purchase.  We love to grind and blend them as you would coffee in a french press.
2;Dry with after taste;I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.
5;Great product, but broken jar;The Bonne Maman Cherry Preserves is our favorite and difficult to find in local supermarkets.  It arrived in excellent time.
5;"Don't forget to ""roast"" the noodles to remove moisture";These are a miracle noodle for me, because  they take care of my cravings for  pasta and can used  in all casserole type dishes as well as just adding sauces.  I used the linguine  for my Mom's best Mac and cheese recipe and It was just as good, if not better.
5;Excellent!;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..
1;Did NOT work for me at all!;I bought my mberry pack from mberry.us online hoping to use it to curb my sweet tooth.
5;Barvo turkey hearts;My dog loves these treats. i feed her raw and this is the perfect additive to get some extra organ meats in her.
5;A coffee that always tastes great;This is my first review I have after written.  I had purchased the 12oz variety 3 pack and they all tasted good.
5;Great treat;At 18 calories per stick, and only a single grain source (rice), these are great treats. Dogs love them.
5;Stash Organic Assam Tea;Stash Organic Assam Tea is my regular everyday tea. Rich and smooth, I can brew it easily by the cup or by the pot.
5;Crispy, tasty, wonderful!;These are just delicious. Better than the traditional chip and better for you too! I would recommend that everyone try them.
5;Excellent and fresh product, reasonable price;I live in Puerto Rico, and finding almond flour is virtually impossible. I was thrilled to find this product at a reasonable price.
5;Perfection.;I'm not picky about much..
4;Good deal;More than the normal amount of lingonbverry jam - with it's usual superlative taste. Problem is, it's not doing my wait any favors.
5;Great Gift Idea;My father in law is a huge fan of coffee. I got this for his Birthday.
5;Excellent Dog Treat;"Right now, ""Mini Naturals"" are the only treat that I give to my dog.  I prefer them for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Ingredients:  When you buy any food or treat for your dog, it is always important to look at the ingredients and the first ingredient especially."
4;Highly Recommend Using as a Moisturizer;This double pack was a terrific deal (~$10) compared to local stores. I bought this product mainly to moisturize my very dry skin and it works wonders! It does not leave the skin feeling greasy compared to other products (e.
3;"More ""spice"" than ""pumpkin""";For years I've been buying pumpkin flavored coffee beans every fall from the coffee shop in my local Borders. Its a flavor I look forward to every year! Well, Borders closed, but we just got our Keurig machine so I was excited to try the pumpkin spice flavor from Green Mountain.
5;Really good for instant;For an instant mix this stuff is awesome, and to me it tastes close enough to what you get at Starbucks.  If you haven't tried it before I would recommend picking up a 3 pack from the store before you buy them in a large quantity (that's what I did, and now I'm hooked!).
5;Love It;My family tends to be hyperactive. This product helps us be more focused.
5;Best I have ever eaten;This oatmeal is wonderful.  When I have it for breakfast I don't get hungry until it is time for lunch.
5;Quite Good;This soup was very good.  The cartons are perfect for two people.
1;Not Mayo at all !!!;I like Walden Farms dressings so I was so excited to taste this mayo.<br />Oh My God!!!!!!!!! What's this!? I am soooooooooo disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The texture is like mushed tofu and the taste is not mayo at all.
5;So healthy and tasty, we all like eating them!;I have a 2 year old son and 5 year old daughter and they both eat Puffets. What a joy when what you feed your 2 year old is also gobbled up and enjoyed by your 5 year old -- and is actually healthy! I pack the 5 year old puffets in her lunchbox and my son and I eat them at home -- yes, I eat them, too.
4;Item as Described;Item was delivered as described. Would purchase again, but only during the fall months as it is a seasonal item.
5;My favorite one so far...;So I haven't tried EVERY coconut water available - but I do love Zico in the reclosable bottle.  It is from concentrate, yes.
5;Great cookies--don't buy in the summer;These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging.
2;Would not buy again;I found these to be disappointing.  I thought they might be soft and chewy, based on the fact that Fig Newtons have that kind of crust.
5;Very nice change from my stronger brews. I Like it A LOT;I just tried this coffee for the first time, and I have to say, I really like it a lot. I normally go for the really strong robust flavors everyday, but was pleasantly surprised with this one.
5;smooth and bitter free;Having tried many different ground coffee for my espresso maker this one is rich and tasty.<br />Where it really stands out for me and my family is there is no bitter taste that is present in a lot of other coffee we have tried.
5;Fresh, tasty, cooks great!;My wife and I have been eating red quinoa for years instead of rice, and love its nutty taste.  In 2011, the price of quinoa has soared with its popularity, and our local grocery stores have run out of the red variant.
1;not what i thought it would be;Not at all what I expected. The flavor is extremely subtle, not really tasting like coconut or pineapple or anything, really.
1;Terrible;This is a terrible product. It just tastes like cocoa and water, no coconut water flavor/taste.
5;Incredibly Flavorful!;This soup is unbelievably delicious. It is rich, savory, hardy, and yet low in calories.
5;Thinking differently about oatmeal;I never really liked oatmeal cookies but the commercial for the Quaker soft baked Oatmeal cookie bought me. I loved how soft it was and tasted just as fresh as a cookie that just cooled down out of the oven.
3;Dog Likes It...;The only thing I can honestly say that I like about the dog food is the convenient, reseal able bag.  We had a stray appear in our neighborhood and although I'm not an avid animal lover, I also don't like to see animals suffer so we began feeding him.
5;Vita Coco is the Best!!!;I love this stuff. It truly is the best and does what it says - hydrates every cell in your body, and revitalizes,as well.
5;Great treats for training;These treats are really small (maybe a quarter-inch square), so I can give them frequently to reinforce behavior.  My dog goes nuts for them, much more so than for any larger treat I've given her.
5;Godd tasting sweetner;I tried this product for the first time at a friend's house.  I first tasted it in a yogurt parfait with fresh fruit.
4;Bad taste, but helps you fall asleep;I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking.
4;Tasty!;The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags.
1;The Trans Fat Lie;"If you needed any more proof that the government is not here to protect you (and it shouldn't be), listen up.<br /><br />This product claims: ""Zero grams of trans fat per serving"" which is code for"
5;Good food, cat loves it;I mainly feed my cat canned food because it's generally healthier than dry, but I give him a small scoop of dry food when his wet food has spoiled and he's whining for a midnight snack or something. They gave us a bag of Science Diet with him at the shelter, which is just filled with terrible stuff (although the cat loved that too, lol) but I wanted another dry food as a supplement, but one that was healthy.
5;Keeps my dog busy!;I have been ordering the everlasting treats for a while now and they really are a great way to keep my Goldendoodle busy.  I have a very bright and powerful chewer who likes to be part of the action at all times.
5;Rooster Sauce;Sriracha is great, great hot sauce. Try it on spring rolls.
5;I love these pops.  I can never find them in local stores.;They are made by Jolly Rancher so the apple portion of the pop tastes like apple Jolly ranchers.  The caramel tastes like caramel.
1;Seattles Best is the worst;This coffee has got to to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever purchased..
5;GREAT Product!!!;I have bought from, and will buy from this vender again. A little slow to ship, but the wait is well worth it.
5;My New Favorite;"Yummy, mild, and delicious. My new favorite! Mild in comparision to coffees called ""rocket fuel"" and taste like motor oil, but truly a medium roast."
5;Delicious, semi-nutritious snack;My son loves these as a special snack treat.  I don't mind giving them to him because the ingredients are pretty good.
1;Not tasty at all;This product tasted like a watered down chocolate baby food product. I purchased it for dipping when I needed a chocolate fix did not live up to half of my expectation.
5;Quality Taste Test;"As far as soup bases and/or flavor enhances go, this product, the ""Knorr Homestyle Stock"" is by far the best that I have ever purchased on the common market. The packaging is just perfect."
5;YUM!!;Not sure why I can never find this flavor in the grocery stores (none!) RYVITA makes delicious crackers, but this one takes the prize. Spread creamy goat cheese or cream cheese on it and your in heaven.
3;SMALLER than you think;Pros: If you like strong licorice flavor, this has it.<br /><br />Cons: If you want a chewy piece of strong licorice, this is NOT for you.
4;Good for road trips;I got these when I was planning a month-long road trip with my friend. We wanted to be able to have PB&J sandwiches for lunches to help save money and didn't want to have to refrigerate the jelly, so this was our solution.
2;Undrinkable;I expected beautiful flowers and a tolerable drink, but got neither. I tried all the different varieties and ended up throwing most away as undrinkable.
1;Poorly packaged...threw away;This product arrived so poorly packaged (no interior padding at all). Then postman left in a sunny spot on my porch all afternoon so I was not confident the sauce wasn't spoiled.
1;Very cheap product, have had to get replacements many times!;I have never reviewed an item before, but taking the time to review the Baby Brezza because of the unfortunate experiences I have had with this product and to warn people not to spend $100 on such a poorly made product..
4;Have switched primarily to this food for both my cats;Fine product, great ingredients list. The cats really seem to like it, though one cat did slim down, the other one actually gained weight, but hopefully only to get to its' ideal weight.
2;My pigs dont like this brand.;My pigs dont like this brand.I think oxbow is better.
5;Delicious!;I love the Twinings Chai Tea Latte for my Tassimo machine.  It is sweet but not too sweet.
4;For Harry Potter fanatics only;"Big Harry Potter fans get a big kick out of these because some the flavors are genuinely odd like those in the books (such as ""rotten egg"" or ""soap"") but they're quite expensive for the size of the boxes. Be aware that each box is tiny - not much bigger than a small pack of gum or mints."
1;Worst packaging and drink ever!;I was hesitant of buying this product since there were so many mixed reviews. I decided to try it since I enjoy coconut water.
5;Excellent enhancement;The Chiquilin paprika arrived promptly and well packaged.  We've used it on a pork shoulder, a casserole and a few other dishes.
5;Quick and tasty;Very easy to mix up in the morning.  Makes great pancakes and waffles.
5;great salads;I have purchased these directly from Germany through a friend stationed over there. If you love German style salads then you will love these.
5;Favorite from my youth.;I chewed this & chicklets when I was a kid. I am always happy when I can find them.
3;This tea is OK.;I thought I was ordering Uncle Lee's tea and ordered this tea by mistake.  Although this tea is tasty, I prefer Uncle Lee's Orange Ginger Chai tea.
5;Good for Senior Cat;I recently purchased this food for my 14 year old cat who was having constipation issues, eating very little, vomiting and losing weight (despite a clean bill of health from her vet).  She loves this food and almost always eats all of it.
5;My son loves this;My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.
5;Great Turkish Delight.;My son was doing a project/presentation on India for a world cultures fair (he is in 6th grade) and wanted to bring Turkish delight for his dish for the international luncheon.  Many children wanted to try it due to the description of it in The Chronicles of Narnia.
4;Great hot chocolate and reasonable price;My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
5;choco gummy bears;I received the pack of gummy bears through usps with an ice pack to keep it cool.  I was impressed by the ice pack since we have a little heat wave that week.
5;Hint;"This water drink is the best!  I love the refreshing taste with just a ""hint"" of a fruit or vegetable.  Best of all there are no additives or after taste."
5;Kaffree Roma;Great way to leave Caffine behind .  I used teabags mixed w/Roma to start, then total Roma after two weeks .
5;Pop Chips;Lower in calories and great taste.  I like them just as much as the regular greasy chips.
5;The smoothest coffee on the market...;"You will never want that ""store bought"" coffee to pass your lips again. Gevalia is one of the smoothest coffee's out there."
2;No Liquorice Flavor, Very Disappointing;After enjoying some licorice peppermint tea at a local restaurant, I was eager to find some for at home.  This is a fine peppermint tea, I was happy to find a herbal blend (caffeine-free), but I cannot taste any trace of licorice in it.
5;Mac and Cheese to a whole new level;Usually mac and cheese is either too much mac versus cheese , or the other way around. This had the perfect balance.
5;Love this product!;When I bought this I was really going out on a limb. I like to read reviews for all skin care product before purchasing.
5;Great coffee for the price;Got the 3 pack of 12-ounce bags on sale for something like $8 or $9..
5;Great tasting coffee.;The coffee is excellent, easy to order and always arrives in a short period of time.  Love the convienence and am about to enjoy a fresh cup this morning.
5;This is best for green smoothie lovers!;My green smoothies taste way better when I add this hemp protein. I usually mix Spring mix or kale with one banana, small handful of blueberries, mangoes, stevia, and hemp protein.
5;Fantastic Oatmeal;I HATE regular oatmeal.  This stuff is so good I eat it every single day.
4;Easy popcorn;I'm happy to say that in this case a pretty package equals yummy popcorn. The freshness is just what you would hope to receive and it is easy to use.
5;Best chai I ever had.;This chai is heaven in a cup. My only complaint would be the amount of sugar that's in this mix.
4;Royal Canin;I am so happy I bought this type of food.  My kitty had to have 3 teeth removed and is now doing so much better with this food that she likes and will eat unlike the prior low calorie food I had her on.
1;BEWARE!!;Black currants are toxic to dogs just like grapes and raisins. Also rosemary has been found to be a nerve toxin in some dogs.
3;If you're really committed to eating them, they're ok;"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech."
1;Product is good but the service is xxxxx;Product is good but the service is xxxxx ..
5;Love this stuff!;This dried fruit mix consists of mangoes, papayas, and pineapples cut into approximately quarter- to half-inch pieces.  I can't find any locally that are cut small so I order these from Amazon.
4;"If you're not into ""super sweet,"" these might be for you";When I first tried this product, I did not really care for it. I decided to give it a few more chances over a week or so, and now I'd have to say that I like it more than I did at first (hence the 4 stars instead of 1!).
1;Epic Fail - Worst Fly Trap Ever Created;We had a problem with a lot of fruit flies in our kitchen.  I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.
5;A Sweet Treat!;These are the only chocolate-covered pretzels i've had and will be the only ones I will ever taste. These are the best snack treats around.
3;Not for my liking;I normally drink organic dark french roast coffee from Trader Joe's, so I wanted to try a vanilla flavored coffe. I liked the slight vanilla flavor this coffee had, but I did notice that it had a much more bitter flavor then my regular coffee, and I don't think that is something I can get used to drinking.
4;Pretty Good;V8 Pomegranate and Blueberry Fusion Drink<br /><br />I liked it. Smaller can so its not high calorie.
5;Great Fortune Cookies;I ordered these to dip in chocolate as my wedding favors. These fortune cookies came in a very sturdy box.
5;Good price on a flavorful tea;I'm always waiting for packaged teas to go on sale, so I was delighted to find Stash at the subscribe and save page.  Very flavorful tea, good iced or hot.
5;Best Homemade coffee!;I have to say, the Mastro Lorenze Crema is the best homemade coffee I ever had. Heck, it's the best I've had, home or commercial, period.
4;Pretty good for decaf;I love REAL coffee, so I'm not a big fan of decaf.  But I like to have it for guests and if I'm in the mood later in the day and don't want caffeine to keep me up.
5;CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND ROBUST;We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.
5;Yummy!;These Cookies are a Soft Cookie.  I absoulutely love them and wish that I could find a similar recipe.
2;Seller review, not item review;$12.95 for shipping in 3-5 days via usps.
3;My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.;Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running.
5;Beaba Babycook rocks!;This is a wonderful item to have for yourself and baby!  Clean up is a snap, and all the parts are BPA free.  I have this unit since March and I love it.
5;great substitute for my favorite potato chip;"just a quick note to let people know this is an excellent tasting, low calorie chip and love ordering these individual sized bags. I'm a 10-year plus Weight Watcher still maintaining my weight loss, and thanks to products like these that do not taste at all like ""diet"" food, I can enjoy all my cravings."
5;Easy just got easier ,with a great product !;These are the perfect size for giving out at Halloween for trick or treaters. I always buy ahead of time because I have soo many trick or treaters.
5;Great item for a great price;This is a quality product for a great price.  Hempseeds are a great way to get omega 3's and digestible protein in your diet daily.
5;olive oil;See Cook's illustrated july/august issue Columela extra virgin olive oil.<br />Highly recommended.
5;Best Yet!;This is my favorite Larabar.<br />The lime and coconut give it a lightness to balance the richer flavors.
4;Dogs liked 'em!;Our two thirteen year dogs like these.  They're prone to major tartar build up on their teeth and these helped some and made their breath better.
5;BLUE DIAMOND ALMONDS;VERY GOOD SERVICE, FABULOUS PRODUCT, VERY FRESH, EXTREMELY WELL PACKED.  WILL MOST DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN.
4;A safe rawhide chew!;We have a toy poodle and he loves rawhide chews. At first we bought the little ones with the ends tied in a knot, but as he got older he could chew the knot off and he would swallow them.
5;Longest lasting dog treat I've found;This is by far one of the best dog treats I've found for my pitbull mix. She will devour a large rawhide in 30 minutes of less.
5;Peak whole dried milk, wonderful;I bought Peak whole dried milk a few months ago, and it is yummy and wonderful! While I am lactose intolerant, I take a digestive capsule with lactase and other digestive aids (getting older!) and it seems to work. I use it for my gluten-free oatmeal that only takes a minute of boiling water, add a spoon or two of this, and I am in heaven for a while! Fresh blueberries and again, a heaping spoon of this, a bit of lactose-free milk for liquid, a little sugar- and back into heaven again.
2;tainted;The saffron arrived with a strong chemical order. It may have been stored close to insecticides.
5;Not sure what the griping is about...;This is a great product and, with the subscribe and save, about half what I would pay at my grocery store (and it's delivered free!) I did not have problems with getting a different kind of tomato than I'd ordered -- I got the regular whole peeled tomatoes. As for the cans being dented, sure, a couple of them are bound to get dented considering it's TWENTY POUNDS OF CANS BEING SHIPPED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
5;Raw unsalted Almonds!;For those who remember cracking almond shells, this tastes the same.  Love that there is no salt added and perfect protein, natural snack  between meals or as a meal for people like me who always forget to eat.
5;Best popcorn I've made so far;"It really does make ""mushroom"" popcorn. It's  more expensive than regular popcorn but It's well-worth a try, whether you are an aficionado or not."
5;yuban umm good;I ordered it thinking it would take a week to get here but recieved it in 4 days. I would recomend odering here anytime.
5;Simply Wonderful;I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk.
5;Most Awesomest HH Yet;On meat binge nights in the strictly vegan Ulinov household, we double up the amount of hamburger for an extra helping of supreme indulgence.  Yummy!  This stuff just totally rocks.
5;Tasty;This is a great choice if you like the cinnamon roll flavor in a K-cup.  We've ordered it before and have always enjoyed it.
5;Great way to cut down on sugar;Splenda is by far the most accurate tasting sugar substitute available.  I bought these packets and have been using them for years.
5;Colavita Whole Wheat Rigatoni;Product has a great taste, price is right for the amount you get. I will be buying this product again when I run out.
2;Celtic Sea Salt;This item was not what I thought it would be.  I thought I was ordering the fine ground salt, but it was the course ground salt.
5;Great wake-up taste.;This blend is not bitter to wake you up, but a mild end that makes your mornings calm.  A delightful slow approach to a busy day.
5;my yorkiepoo ate it like a treat... we mixed it with his pedigree;my yorkiepoo ate it like a treat..
5;My son loves them. Keeps him going on Campus.;I send the Diletante Espresso Bean Blend to my son in Miami. They are sent directly to him and that in itself<br />makes it easier for me.
1;this 'snack bar' gets my vote...;for about the worst-tasting product i have even tried in the last 10 years..
5;Yummy, chewy blueberry goodness...;I love blueberries so I was really looking forward to trying these..
5;Sugar Twin better than the rest;I have enjoyed sugar twin since my mother first sent it to me in a care package while I was stationed in germany back in 1974 due to my weight and the military rules on weight control, it helped ne to maintain a level of weight that was acceptable to the miltary.  I love it and have to order as no commercial or military facility in the area of the U.
5;Great Tasting and affordable;Addicted to this brand and found this coffee fresh, bold and unbitter.<br />The delivery was super fast and my only complaint is it came in an unmarked box meaning I felt I had to count.
5;Delicious whole wheat pretzels!;I have been looking for 100% whole wheat pretzels for a long time.  These are the only ones I've been able to find.
5;Absolutely loved it. promo was great too;Finally purchased in bulk. The Nature valley promo was a great incentive to buy.
3;Mostly Raspberry in the bags;"I kinda figured I was going to get a ton of the ""undesirable"" flavored candies. I bought this bag to get the hard to find lemon and grape flavored Pez."
5;Tasty Brown Rice;If you're looking for some tasty brown rice, this brand is great.  I made it tonight for the first time and loved it.
5;Yummy!;I love these cookies.  I can't eat gluten and they are a healthy treat.
3;grilled chicken;There is really no grilled taste to the chicken which is disappointing.  Good texture not alot of chicken flavor to the meat so it needs spices.
5;Best Formula in the market;I love this formula. My older one started on formula when she was 6 months old.
4;Surprisingly tasty coffee at a nice price;"Let's face it - ""Folgers"" isn't a name that usually springs to mind when you think of great coffee, but this isn't bad.  Nice aroma, a balanced blend that's not too strong, but still provides plenty of flavor."
3;Good concept, but doesn't replace your regular sauce;This is a good way to alter the heat of your dish, but it is a rather thin (watery) sauce.  It doesn't replace the other sauces in my collection but is useful for changing the heat of them or for spicing up another dish that I won't use a thicker hot sauce in.
5;Great Buy;This is a great tasting product that also came in a very appreciated packagin. I do thank you guys.
5;Delicious! Drunken Fruit recipe included;Excellent all around. The peaches are not too sweet and firm, not soggy.
5;stinky delight;I find these a little stinkier than most treats.  This is probably why my dog suddenly turns into the most obedient dog on the Pacific coast any time these are near.
5;For chocolate lovers;I wanted to try this Callebaut Cocoa Powder after it was top-rated by America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated (they never let me down!).  It is great.
5;Very tasty!;This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)<br /><br />The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well.
5;Excellent;This grade B has much richer maple flavor than any grade A that I have tasted.  Quite a treat with the weekend family breakfast.
5;Great Product, Great Price;Although the picture for this product shows it to be WHOLE flaxseed, it is as the description states - - GROUND flaxseed. I use this every morning and every evening (1T each time) and I have noticed a positive change in my body since I've been using it.
4;Old favorite;This is a nice coffee..
5;Great selection;A great way to try different coffee/tea flavors before deciding to buy a box of 18 or more.  Nicely packaged as well.
5;Tricks for Treats;Pick up the bag, give it a shake and your cat will come running. They'll start purring before you even get the bag open.
5;Great food;I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.
5;Great Morning Beginning;This Coffee People Dark Roast, Jet Fuel is just the right answer for a Great Morning Beginning for me.  It is just the right amount of flavor and it has just the right amount of 'kick' to get me going with a smile on my face.
5;Great food, but better prices elsewhere;My dog really seems to like this food, and it treats her well.  She has never had an upset stomach or anything from this.
5;SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!;That stuff is so good! Creamy, crunchy and incredible nutty. I can't eat peanut butter (ALLERGY) and after trying Sunbutter I don't even care anymore, because peanut butter can't be better than that.
5;Wonderful~ Definitely my favorite right before bed;I drink tea like a fiend.  Right before bed, this is definitely my favorite.
5;good healthy snack;I got these as a healthy lunch snack.  Taste great.
3;Great taste and price but early expiration date;My daughter loves this product and it becomes a little treat.<br />The only reason I give only three stars here is because of the expiration date.
3;All-natural Strawberry Fanta;You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural.
5;Great tasting;They arent too salt and vinegary, but still have the flavor of it.  Very good tasting.
5;Love these Ginger Mints;I just love these Altoids Ginger Mints. You can't find these mints in any stores, so I am glad Amazon.
4;Good product, not price;At $1.88 a tub, this runs more that what I find in most grocery stores as well as W*l M*rt and T*rget.
1;DO NOT BUY! LINKED TO HUNDREDS OF DOG DEATHS!;Just go to this article  [..
5;Gluten Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix;Wonderfully tasty brownies for those of us who can't have glutens in our diet.  These are so good, very moist, great taste and I can't tell them from the regular brownies I use to make from scratch.
5;The best;These are the best mints we've had. First bought them on a trip to England, and have been getting them ever since.
3;There's better out there;Too strong for a medium brew, there is much better.  Coffee People Donut shop is my favorite unflavored coffee.
5;YUMMY... can't get enough!;This is a great value over buying them in individual packages at the store.  The chews consistently taste fresh because they are packaged very well.
4;Enjoyable Chai Experience;"****<br /><br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."
5;Very Good Coffee;I was a bit skeptical about ordering this coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good and the cost is a fraction of what other K-cups are going for these days.
5;Crystal Light drink mix packets;I love the product, a plastic box of individual<br />Crystal Light drink mix packets in 4 flavors.<br />Each packet is good for one 500ml water bottle.
4;Another great product from Knott's BF;I ordered the Boysenberry Shortbread cookies from here.  And I've tried to raspberry from my local grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.
5;Great tea!;"Fabulous tea! YUM! Well balanced and flavorful, I like making a large pot at a time. Sometimes for a little more ""bite"" or because I didn't hear the timer go off, I will give it a little extra steeping time and I always satisfied with the results."
4;Good product, MUCH cheaper elsewhere.;Great quality but the price on Amazon is very high. $15-$20 for the 64 pack at Costco or Sam's Club.
2;Not enough flavor;I'm not picky at all when it comes to food but this beef jerky was some of the blandest jerky I've ever had. Not much flavor at all.
5;Wow.;I have suffered with insomnia for the past 10 years.  This product cured it.
4;Delicious;I bought these for my 5 year old, but I think I like them more than he does!  These are a great healthy sweet snack that's not too sweet.  For me, it curbs my craving without feeling like I've just taken in a bunch of unhealthy fillers and chemicals.
4;Good but pricy;These were great. But there isn't enough in the package to justify the price plus shipping.
5;It is big help;I give my daughter this Prune when she become constipation. I usually fined it either Baby R us or Whole Foods but they did not have anymore.
4;GM Double Black Diamond - Pretty good.;One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.
5;So delicious;This very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream, or with coffee or tea.  It's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor.
4;Cool toy, too bad my dog is too stupid;Oh I mean, I love my dog.  A lot.
5;My daughters love it.;My teenage daughters think this is the best-tasting microwave popcorn there is (although it's a bit buttery for my tastes as I'm used to the dry diet kind) and they love the bowl.<br /><br />It felt awkward to pull the top off the first time, but now that we've done it about a dozen times, it's really easy.
3;This product is dog food not a snack for humans;I was looking for heathy sweet potato chips and see this item.  Ordered it quickly and had to return it because it<br />is for dogs not for humans.
1;Terrible price-double of waht you get in Indian stores;I haven't purchased this, but was interested in the indian groceries Amazon had.<br /><br />The prices for all Indian groceries is more than double of waht is sold in indian stores.
4;a pleasant brew;"Starbucks coffee has a signature taste that my husband describes as ""burnt beans"".  This SB vanilla blend has the same subtle ""burnt"" aftertaste, with a hint of vanilla that is just right- not too faint and not too pronounced."
5;Rich Caramel Flavor;I use Monin Organic Syrups and their regular syrups daily. These are wonderful in tea and coffee enhancing their flavors.
5;my dog loved these;my dog really loves these. he is a shitzu maltese mix and they are easier than pig ears for him to chew on and he normally grabs one in the afternoon and runs outside to eat them in the grass while sunbathing.
5;Better than you-know-who's coffee...;"So my wife is a latte freak, and nursing, so decaf is the approved type.  After the Senseo left the market, I struggled and found the <a href=""http://www."
5;Favorite Starbucks Flavor;This is a delicious mild variety of coffee. Not overly strong like most of Starbucks coffees.
5;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this item!!!!!;This item is awesome!!!! I have three daughters and I don't feel like making baby food consumes all my time. It so simple to use and clean and requires little effort.
4;Great Treats;My dog loves these treats. I use them during training or fill them in her ruff wear square ball.
3;If you like Starbucks....;Myself, I always find Starbucks coffee to be a bit on the bitter side (I take my coffee black, so maybe milk and sugar soften it) and this is no exception. It's a decent coffee, for all that, and if you're a fan of the Starbucks general taste, you will love this.
4;K-cup coffee 34 count;Had no problem with this order and was for the most part pleased.  First of all, I am not a fussy coffee drinker so it didn't bother me that I didn't get all that was displayed on order.
5;cats LOVE it;My cats LOVE this product..
5;Best Flavor for fussy eaters;Excellent flavor for difficult eaters. Our 2 yr old son will eat almost nothing except milk.
3;These Contain Milk;I bought these at a specialty store before ordering them from amazon.  They did not contain milk at that time.
4;Pretty Good;My son has life threatening allergies to milk, eggs, and peanuts. He also cannot eat wheat.
2;great product but it is from China;I don't trust dog treats (or much else) from China.<br />WISH AMAZON WOULD StART A MADE IN AMERICA CATEGORY!!<br />I love my Amazon prime account.
3;OK, but very dry.;I like the fact that the beef is organic, but unfortunately in this case it was a little dry for my tastes.  Not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is standard, but I'm a regular jerky consumer and would consider this some of the driest I've encountered.
1;Just plain ol' not good;Bought these from another vendor, as I was craving licorice. I love licorice, all kinds, and I couldn't even eat more than a taste of this.
5;Healthy snack;Great way to top off a meal with controlled amount and not a lot of sugar. One can never get to old for this kind of treat.
3;Good coffee;This is good coffee, although not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I used it in my Mr.
5;Have an outstanding sandwich;I read the reviews of Roland tuna before I ordered it
2;WORST DOG GAS EVER.;"If you have a dog, you probably know the distinctive ""dog fart"" odor.  This food, for some reason, multiplied that for one of my two dogs."
1;Don't waste your money...;Having used Urbani Truffle Oil I am probably spoiled when it comes to others.  I purchased the La Tourangelle from the local supermarket.
5;very impressed;I ordered this plant because my grandsons are very interested in carniverous plants. They will be very happy to see this plant.
5;Meets the needs of 6 fussy eaters;I have 11 rescue cats and 6 of them really like this food. Three of these guys have IBD which gave them chronic vomiting problems.
5;Good For Indigestion;This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water.
1;Vending Machine Coffee, dont buy it.;This coffe is terrible, too sweet and it does not taste like Cappuccino at all. Save yourself some money and buy real coffee like the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser for your Keurig.
3;Good but not great;These sardines are very good. Great for crackers, salads or horderves(sp?).
1;Tastes Like Grass;I read the other reviews about the taste of this product being less than ideal but i shrugged if of as i was planning to use it in my brealfast along with oats. That first time i had a real eye opener.
5;really good tea;Tea is a staple of my life!  This is a very good tea at a very good price.  I'm enjoying a mug of it now while I write this.
4;Pretty Good, not the greatest;This is a pretty good low end pu-erh, sweet and earthy. Because there can be some confusion about how to make it, here is how I do it.
4;Great tea good price;I have a pot of tea every morning,about three cups, this is the best I've found. The price is great when ordered by the kilo.
5;An enjoyable cup of coffee!;Newman's Special Blend Decaf is a very enjoyable cup of coffee anytime of gthe day.  Good flavor and very smooth.
5;Best Bone I've ever bought;This bone lasted about 4 months of daily chewing with my 85lb chocolate lab.  The center is hard, so he couldn't just lick out the inside.
3;jar only half full;The product works fine as a black mustard seed in my seasonings but, unlike the image on Amazon, the jar arrived only about half full.  It may be that the product is sold by weight and that amount was in the jar but I don't think so.
5;Like this flavor;I'm surprised this flavor has so many negative reviews.  This is one of my favorite flavors, it's not overly rich like some of the others.
4;"Don't be put off by the ""slow cooked"" title -- it can be fast";Forget the other tricks -- steel cut oats is something that could have been tailor-made to pre-prepare in the era of refrigeration.  About once a week or so in the evening when I'm in the kitchen cooking something else anyway, I partially cook up a pot of oats (I've always used McCanns, which is great, and I'm going to try some from the local health food store out of the bin -- I'll then decide whether to switch.
1;Yuck!;I'm a big fan of Zevia sodas and drink several cans per day during the summer months. With that said and just to be fair, I have to tell you that I'm not a big root beer fan to begin with.
2;Two out of Three ain't bad... kind of.;I just received my order for El Guapo corn husks. Two of the 6oz packages were fine.
5;Nice;Great taste.Plenty of almonds and coconut.
4;Smooth and nice-perfect for breakfast;"After running out of my usual every-day tea, Trader Joe's brand of ""Irish Breakfast Tea,"" I found this Yellow Label first at my local Chinese supermarket in the tea aisle. I had only had the ""brisk"" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it."
1;Worst of any gluten free product yet;It's hard to believe the 5 star reviews for this cornbread mix.  I should have rated it zero stars.
5;best of both worlds;All the subtlety of coconut milk with the richness of almond milk. It has a much more neutral taste than plain almond milk, which I love.
2;Ok...;I thought this was freeze dried (crunchy). It isn't.
5;Great Product!;I am very pleased with the crystallized ginger I purchased. Product came in a great storage can, sliced uniformly, great taste.
5;Cinnamon Thins = Yum!;Absolutely delicious cookies - crisp & crunchy, but not hard
5;Salty and Spicey;Love this wonderful concoction.  I use it all the time, on everything I cook, and especially on veggies I DO NOT cook.
1;leaky;Good Honey, But bottles leaked inside box during shipment. Be careful if you order this, the packaging isn't great and the bottles are subject to leaking during transport.
4;A dogs point of view;My name is Nougat and I am a little over a year old, and I am a Border Collie mix. I have had my first bag for several months now and it is time to reorder, so my human mommy and daddy asked me to help give a review.
2;blah;I was really excited for this flavor, but it's just so boring. Very weak coffee with a hint of flavor.
4;works well, but still a messy job;works well, but still a messy job. easy to set up & looks good.
5;Great product and service;The item was received very quickly and the service was excellent. I recommend this company without hesitation, and also this product.
5;We add it to coffee;Got this as a gift to start and started putting a little in with the grounds when brewing coffee.  Husband says it makes the coffee less irritating to his stomach and adds just a hint of flavor.
5;good for him and he loves them;My vet suggested these chews for my dog's bad breath but he charges more than twice what Amazon offers them for. My chihuahua loves them and  he knows when I go to the kitchen he will be getting his special treat.
1;Not Happy at all;This was advertised to be an assortment of flavors, not 2 different brands of vanilla.  Had I just wanted vanilla coffee I could have just bought a box of that flavor only.
5;This is the best pet food manufacturer around. Period.;I am a research fiend.<br />When we bought our cat the vet recommended Science Diet, which, compared to the Orijen nutrition/ingredient lists, is a far cry from a quality cat food.
5;So far, so great!;I ordered these last July and have just now begun to use them in some 'no-knead' recipes. I have had the greatest success and can only say that I wish I had started sooner but just couldn't get past the 'fear' of actually trying my hand at baking bread.
1;Never tasted cheddar cheese like this!;I really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews.  I am not a cheese snob.
4;Kona Blend;Good for what it is, a quick cup of coffee with a slightly different flavor.  The 10% blend isn't quite enough to really make a huge impact on the taste.
5;Great substitute for regular gumballs!;I bought these because my son was dying for a gumball machine but I refused to let him eat sugary gum all day.  We've already been to the dentist too many times.
5;a carnival at home;My daughter loves funnel cake at fairs. Now we can have a fair anytime.
4;ORGANIC APPLE JUICE;GREAT PACKAGING.  EASY TO HANDLE AND OPEN PLASTIC BOTTLES.
5;a delicious cookie;especially good as a breakfast cookie.  nice & crunchy, thin & the bits of fruit are chewy & substantial.
1;Bad;More jerky that is made in China. Unknowing owners are feeding this potential killer to their loved pets.
4;one of my favorite cookies;These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them.
2;Totally mediocre;The attractive packaging and customer reviews made me very eager to try this. I have recently learned the joys of dipping French bread into seasoned olive oil and had hoped this would be spectacular.
5;My preferred salt for grinders;This is my preferred salt for my OXO Good Grips Salt Grinder (http://www.amazon.
5;Fabulous travel sweetener!;Love this item, it's a great way to keep your preferred sweetener accessible. Some places only stock sugar and Sweet 'n Low.
5;Great flavored port kit;This dark chocolate orange flavored port kit is excellent. Equal to the (more expensive) RJ Spagnols kit of the same flavor.
5;Midnight Harvest...midnight snack;This chocolate is practically good for you.  Dark chocolate, hazelnuts and almonds, cranberries.
1;Kitty does not like it...;What a wonderful thought that Newman's Own makes cat food. Organic cat food.
5;Chocolate Vanilla Glutino Wafers;These are the best gluten-free cookies that I have ever tasted.  They are as good as the regular wafer cookies (or better!).
5;Good stuff;This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
5;Love 'em, they're great!;The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. It's full, but compact.
5;tastes like thai tea;i found this mix, when prepared properly, similar to what i would get at thai restaurants. i found the scent pleasing when brewing the tea.
5;Excellent Quality;
5;Cracked Pepper;Just finished my last 128 gm bag and ordered a dozen more.<br /><br />What can I say other than I'm addicted to these and I'm NOT a snack person.
5;AWESOME PRODUCT;I just wanted to say a few words about the Good Sense Natural Vanilla Yogurt Pretzels.  They are the best pretzels that I have ever eaten and the good news is they are much cheaper than the ones you can find in the natural food stores.
5;Excellent for decaf;Emeril's K-cups, Jazzed Up Decaf and Timothy's Decaf Rainforest Espresso Extra-Bold show that great coffee can be made from decaf K-Cups.  Both are rich and full bodied with ample taste and aroma.
1;Gum is old and stale;First I have to say that I love this gum.  With that being said I was extremely disappointed when I received my order.
4;Needs more broccoli;As promised, this pasta was very easy and fast to make.  The whole meal can be made in one pan, which is also a plus.
1;Into the trash;Don't be as stupid as I am. I threw my money away buying this product, just as I am going to do with these candys.
5;Yummy yum yum!;What can I say? I'm a sucker for anything marshmallow & this is included in that love. Maybe it came from an early appreciation for toasted marshmallows, but in any case I'm always looking for something tasty & marshmallow-ly for a dessert item.
3;Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use;It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha.
5;A refreshing bargain;I drink a giant mug of this almost nightly. Peppermint is very soothing and relaxing, and it's great for settling an upset stomach.
4;best warm;These are impressive brownies, but you have to nuke them slightly before eating. The chocolate chunks melt and create a lovely lava cake type of experience.
5;Love this flavor!;This is my favorite flavor of coffee for my Keurig.  I like coffee that is a lighter brew, and this is perfect.
5;An acquired taste;Personally I love these food bars. Most people do not.
5;My favorite cookies!;Love these cookies. Perfect 3 oz size bags at a great price.
5;Nutiva Coconut Oil;This is great stuff, can be used in cooking as a healthy alternative to butter or other oil. I also use it as a base for skin creams.
5;Pecan Pie!!!;This bar tastes just like pecan pie!!!<br /><br />It is truly amazing. There is no flour, sugar, eggs, chemicals, preservatives, or anything bad.
5;Delicious and multi-purpose!;These bars are THE BEST! They are my go-to bar whether it be for a quick breakfast or a guilt free snack. Tasty and filling and the extra protein is a bonus.
4;Some chips flavors are really good others...;"""Wow some of these popchip flavors are the bomb-diggity."" That is what I would say if I wrote this review 15 years ago."
5;SO good...;Cannot find this product at stores in my area anymore..
2;Not fresh;The coffee was not vacuum sealed and was not as fresh as previous bags of this product. I received several sample sized bags of this product as a gift and liked the taste so much that I ordered a large bag.
5;java strength matchs mocha flavor;I reordered this java mocha via the subscribe and save subscription because the price per pound was good at the same time flavored coffee prices were rising. Price was the deciding factor.
5;INFO ABOUT RECALL- and my personal review at the end;March 1, 2011<br /><br />Vet Med received notification today from WellPet® LLC., the parent company for WELLNESS® Pet Foods, that specific lots of WELLNESS® canned cat foods, purchased from our store, should be returned to us immediately for replacement.
5;Yum!;I tried someone's recipe with the frozen banana, no dairy milk (eek used dairy!), and pb2. First of all, major froth - I assume because of the actual milk.
5;Delicious and versatile!;I love, love, LOVE this mix!  I use the muffin directions and a mini dougnut maker to make GF donuts with raspberry jelly, frosting, cinnamon sugar, etc.  DELICIOUS!  Also added some fresh sweet corn, GF corn meal and sugar to make out-of-this-world corn muffins.
5;Definitely reduces cramping while giving you energy;I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days.
5;Amazing! The best chorizo I've had in a long time.;Absolutely fantastic. Such great flavor, just the right amount of heat to it.
5;Intense;Very good sugar free candy.  You'd never know the difference.
3;Solid, not spectacular;In lieu of the nearly mythical regard of this coffee according to our Amazon reviewers, I simply had to give this a go. Initial results are: good, but not as good as advertised.
2;My cat says no.;My cat will only eat this if there is nothing else. However my dog likes it.
5;Best bottled apple juice EVER!;"Hubby and I discovered this juice when we visited our local Chipotle restaurant for tacos.<br /><br />We were both going, ""Mmmmm."
4;Better than I expected;This review is based on a sample box provided from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I eat a lot of cereal.
1;HORRIBLE....very disappointed.;I was so excited to find this product, but I was very disappointed. It's has a plastic taste.
4;Good cat food company but....;My cats like this food and it is truly grain free. However, I think the cans actually contain more calories - especially the Lamb and Venison formulas - than the website states they do.
5;Great product;The Loma Linda Vege- Burger, is ideal for everyone, this Vege- Berger can be used in any meal that requires ground beef.  It can be season with a variety of condiments.
5;Great Product;This is a great product. We recently adopted a 3 1/2 yr old German Shepherd that has a short attention span.
5;The best Dijon Mustard;Maile from France is simply the best Dijon mustard available in the U.S.
5;Great Cereal;This is an awesome cereal.  High in fiber, low in sugar, tastes great!<br />What more could you want?  I wish we could buy it locally.
1;too expensive;these sell in any grocery store for 3.99 to 5.
5;Very Good Sugar Free Cookies;Murray's Sugar Free Peanut Butter cookies are one of my favorites and<br />are as good as any peanut butter cookies that are not sugar free. I keep<br />a supply on hand and my some of my friends have started buying them even<br />though they don't need to have sugar free products.
3;I like it but the cost;I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa.
3;no MSG? ahem;It contains autolyzed yeast extract  which is equivalent to MSG.  I checked the nutrition info on their website and it wasn't included in the list of ingredients so I grabbed a box I had in the kitchen and it was listed there.
5;Very Satisfied!;Speedy delivery and excellent packaging.  Seeds germinated 100% and plants are just now putting out their second set of leaves.
4;As a breakfast cereal, it was okay but...;As a breakfast cereal, it was okay but as an afternoon snack it was great.<br /><br />When the milk hits this cereal it just absorbs it and it becomes a soggy, rather bland experience.
4;Great color;Bought these because we couldn't find these colors locally.  They were for my granddaughter's 5th birthday party.
5;Fantastic!;Rarely can I say that a GF product tastes better than the gluten version.  Thse cookies do, though.
5;Familiar Like the Girl Next Door: Latte Macchiato Meets a Delicious Need;My Nescafe Dolce Gusto Latte Macchiato was born on my counter, not royal, nor so humble that I would not enjoy her company. Finding companionship with wine glasses, she smiled at me, and together, we ran through the morning with celebration of sugar, caffeine and artificial milk.
5;I am buying more!;I got this in my Christmas stocking from my stepfather.  We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.
5;Best K Cup;I love this coffee because it isn't bitter.  It has a hint of chocolate and it isn't like having a mocha.
5;Great holiday chocolate for a gift or for yourself.;My girlfriend first introduced me to peppermint bark. I have to admit, I was skeptical at first because when I've eaten peppermint(I guess like a candy cane) in the past, it gets all stuck in my teeth and takes forever to get out.
5;Excellent;I recently adopted two kitties from a shelter, one of them on a grain-free diet already. The shelter gave me dry food to take home for them but they both wouldn't touch it.
1;Awful, Just Awful;OK, allow me to make the following disclaimer prior to the review:<br /><br />I have drank a LOT of soda in my life..
5;Cat Crack;Bobbaaayyy!!!  My cat loves this stuff and now ignores her regular kibble and wet food in lieu of her treats.  She's over 16 years old and at that age it's good to see her get excited over something as simple as a handful of kitty snacks.
5;Yummy coffee;For the price, this is the best coffee I know of. I buy it whole bean and grind it myself.
5;Best packaged Soup around!;I don't normally write reviews for products, but I have to say that I took a chance on buying two boxes of these due to price.  I was very shocked, and happy, with my first experience with this soup.
5;STRONG but GOOD!;I  have tried the Via's and they are Good but a little stronger than i like. I believe it calls for 8 oz of hot water.
4;Tasty, vegan, and super convenient;This product is excellent for an easy lunch outdoors, at work, or at school. No need for utensils, a microwave, hot water, etc.
5;Great product;I made both regualr yogurt and soy yogurt.  Works well with both and I like the fast incubation period.
5;Wonderful traditional Mexican treat!;"I couldn't believe I found the traditional glass jar! I grew up in Mexico, and a few years back, Coronado switched to squeezable bottles. Unfortunately, this means they also thinned the cajeta out to make it ""squeezable""."
5;perfect food for my old dog :);Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.
1;Barely a Hazelnut Flavor from Gloria Jean;Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers.
5;Low-Carb dieters Life Saver!;Substitute this delicious low-carb tortillas anywhere you use bread. I love hot dogs, but instead of a bun these days I melt some cheese on one of these (or the other regular carb-balance tortilla) squirt some mustard on it and wrap it around a cooked frank.
5;His favorite flavor....;He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL.
4;Handy for travel;While nothing can beat a real Thai iced tea, this is pretty good.  I carry these with me to use while I'm in the cafeteria for convenience.
2;Not a preferential hot sauce;For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.
5;yummy;Got three different Amish popcorn's for my daughter's Birthday..
5;Delicious;Yum, yum, yummy!! I included these cookies in the goody bags at my son's 3rd bday party. They are very tasty.
2;k cup assortment;very disappointed.  All the k-cups were just thrown in a box.
5;Great Buy;1st time purchase.  I was very pleasantly surprized.
4;Good but salty;These taste very much like the Trader Joe's and Sea's Gift brands.  The only difference is they are saltier.
4;Zero calories, caffine, and carbonization;This flavor is the only Crystal Light product I enjoy.<br />It seems to be no-longer available in my area.
3;Meh;"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice."
5;Works for me;This drink does what I need it to do and does it fast.<br />Taste is good and the boost I get is good.
5;The Best Refried Beans in a Can EVER;I am a lifelong eater of refried beans. As a vegetarian, this is a staple in my diet.
5;Great flavor;Wow, the olive flavor socked me from the first bite. GREAT flavor.
4;Babies on the move;If you are feeding Similac Sensitive then buy these now. We purchased a box to have for the diaper bag and for back-up.
5;Good Tea;This is a good tasting tea at a great price. If you don't normally like raspberry flavor, this isn't really raspberry flavor, if that makes sense.
5;C.S. Mandarin Spice from Amazon;This was a very good tasting tea! I really do enjoy all of Celestial Seasonings Teas.  I will be purchasing more of the same thing soon.
5;Great but...;Great product.  My 1 year old tabby loves this wand and feather combo.
5;Do yourself a favor and order this exquisite Green Tea;I only thought I knew what Green Tea was supposed to taste like before trying this awesome product. My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit).
5;Awesome!;I absolutely love this coconut oil.  It is delicious in oatmeal and I even use it in my coffee (I used to use coconut creamer).
2;Is there Cinnamon in these?;"I've been munching on these for about 2 weeks because the tin shows in nice big dark letters at the bottom of the lid ""Cinnamon"". I've recently been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes and read some urban legends that talked about the possible benefits of cinnamon helping to stabilize or lower blood sugar."
5;Picky eaters, sensitive stomachs, tried everything, and Blue Wins!;I've had dogs my entire life and have recently acquired a dog with a sensitive stomach and another with diarrhea problems. We've tried everything on the market, trust me! Blue Buffalo is a godsend and my dogs actually enjoy meal time and the afterwards
4;Pretty Good Chocolate Chip Cookies;I am a big fan of chocolate and chocolate chip cookies, so I am somewhat partial to these gooey cookies. They are filled with chocolate fudge, which makes them noticeably sweeter than most other chocolate chip cookies.
5;nice flavor;I have a friend who is a dandelion warrior.  Everytime she see's one, she pounces and that plant is history.
4;Just another form of liquid sugar, but I like controlled portion size...;Izze's grapefruit flavored sparkling juice is, for all practical purposes, just another formulation of liquid sugar, albeit from grape, pear, and other fruits.  Nutritionally, it really is no different from any other sugar-based drink, whether orange juice or sugar soda.
5;Blotto cries for it!;My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet.
5;YUMMY!;YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.
5;Steel Cut Oatmeal;Original order of 8 cans arrived in badly dented shape. I sent email to complain because the severe denting would most likely compromise the integrity of the product.
2;not tannic not exciting.;finally bought some of this and i am not impressed. its weak and doesnt live up to thedescription on dilmah's website.
5;Pleased;Shipped in 3 days wow! Great tasting sauce and sad to say it is not available in all 50 states. Thank you for making it available to everyone around the country.
5;super good;I got a sample of these about 3 years ago from a business I walked in to one time.  I raved about it to them so they gave me the whole bag, and I loved them all, and shared them with everyone I knew.
5;Reidel Wine Sreies is Great!;Riedel Wine Sreies is the best value out there for wine lovers.  The unique shape of each glass for different varietals and types of wine truly enhance the wine drinking experience.
5;Yum!;First, I love the new shape of the gum..
5;Throw your Whoppers away!;"Go ahead and forget everything you think you know about the delicacy known as chocolate covered maltballs. Now try these -> <a href=""http://www."
5;delicious!;I was surprised to find grandmas chocolate online lol, especially because this delicious product originated from Mexico. My mother used to give it to my brothers and me often enough, its part of our family you can say.
5;Outstanding!;"This is an astoundingly good cup of coffee!<br /><br />From the scent to the cup this is a great medium bodied coffee with NO burnt beans & NO bitter taste - during or after. The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the ""exotic floral and berry"" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is."
5;Lunch replacement.;While on jury duty for two weeks I packed a half cup in a baggie to nibble on during breaks. The seeds were so good and so filling that I started packing about three-quarters of a cup for lunch each day.
5;EXCELLENT product!;I love the Sweetleaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia! It tastes soooooo much better than powdered stevia products. Now I enjoy iced tea sweetened with stevia knowing that I am not adding any calories or artificial sweeteners to my diet.
5;It's a candle, but smaller than store bought ones;It's getting very hard to find these at stores, so I searched here on Amazon. The store bought ones are about double size of these.
5;I use these every day;Have been using these now for over three years.  The flavor quality is outstanding and the simplicity of use is great!  I have been on subscribe and save on this now for two years!  Never without a good cup of brew.
5;Cambezola;An amazing cheese. I've enjoyed blue cheeses for years, and have recently discovered the triple cream cambezola.
3;Tasty Maple Syrup;Tasty Syrup, but I was walking the aisle at my local superstore and found the exact same product for $3 less. And I don't live anywhere near vermont.
1;Not Fresh!;In all the advertisements I've seen for the new canister, French's claims this packaging will help the product stay fresh.  I suppose that might be possible, IF they were fresh in the first place.
1;I'm not saying my dog's a genious, but.....;The layers spin very easily and my 5 year old female weimaraner cleared each slot of hidden treats in less than a minute. If you nudge it gently it opens & aligns and as long as you don't bump it, it stays in place to eat each dish.
5;Maple Syrup;Butternut Mountain Maple Syrup is the real deal. The grade B is wonderful on pancakes, or in coffee- just about on anything you'd like sweetened.
5;Heaven in a Nut!;These little nuts are amazing! Almonds are so healthy for us and add a little sweetness and this becomes the perfect treat. I love carrying this bag in my purse for a quick pick me up or even in place of popcorn or candy during a movie.
5;A.M. Kahlua;Folks,<br />Kahlua coffee in the morning sure beats too much Kahlua in the evening.  Great way to ease in to the day.
5;Worked perfectly;I picked up a bag of these locally (not on Amazon) for my bf's treat-driven English Setter.  He needed to take pills for a few weeks to clear up a skin condition, but half the time he would spit the pill out.
5;Coffee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;ok I love coffee and have it everywhere. I wasn't sure I was going to like this but found it just what I was looking for while at our cabin in upstate New York.
3;Disappointing;I love falafel and looked forward to trying this brand because it looked authentic.  I knew as soon as I cut open the plastic envelope that it was a mistake.
5;Great product-Great packing;I was a little concerned about the shipping and packing after reading the reviews.<br />They evidently listened to you and took your suggestions, because my items were very well packed, each individually wrapped with bubble wrap, and bubble wrap around the six of them inside the box.
1;Complete Con;This item clearly says Pack of 6 but it is not it is one pack.A complete and total con.
4;My Dog gave it 2 paws up :);My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds.
5;good dog food;switched over to this because of the new puppy.  all the dogs could eat the same food which was convenient.
5;Payton LOVES these!;My lil pup loves his treats! Recently when I was visiting my moms house he found his way under and was being a lil explorer and I shook the bag of treats and he came running. I ordered a bag to try then ordered two more shortly after.
4;Great for hair and cooking;I use this product in my hair because it is a great moisturizer and sealant (I have natural kinky african american hair). After I washed my hair, I applied this product section by section and twisted my hair.
1;Poor substitute;Save yourself from trying these k-cups - not a good substitute for the typical ones, like the ones from Green Mountain.  Bitter taste and unpleasant after taste as well.
5;A Delicious Pot of Coffee;We were so pleased when we made our first pot of Boyer's Coffee and every cup thereafter. We were really glad we tried it and will buy it in the future.
5;Surprisingly Tasty!!;I first discovered Orgain (chocolate flavor) at Farm to Market. Although very skeptical, I found the high protein content to be appealing, so I purchased it, and cautiously tried it a couple days later, room temperature.
1;no flavor;Was very disappointed, there was no real cheese flavor. Had to add our own extra sharp cheddar to give it pop.
5;Hassle free, great on the go food;The Keebler PB&J crackers are extremely difficult to find in major grocery chains but when you do find them, hang onto them. They are the perfect travel food for just about everyone.
4;Love the apple better than the apple/banana;I love these for when I jog long distances - instead of using the gels
4;Good taste;"I was originally using the ""Morning Blend"", which had a good taste, but I think this blend is smoother.  Also, the price is a little less, so it's a win/win situation."
5;Arrived on time and all seems to be in order;product arrived on time and exactly as advertised.  I can not get this type of tea locally here in our small Texas town, so it was delightful to find it at such a good price at Amazon.
1;Horrible aftertaste - cheap licorice flavoring;These are not authentic pontefract cakes.  They have a horrible aftertaste.
3;Most people will like this;
5;INcredible addition for cooking!;I was excited to mix this right away.  Reviews are saying smoothies and such but there is no limit to what you can cook with this amazing powdered product.
5;Haribo gummi bears;The best gummi bear around, got hooked on these when I was a kid. At the time only got them at Marshall Field store in Chicago.
5;A great condiment and a good price;There are two kinds of pickle eaters, those who eat pickles and those who savor them.  Some of us among the latter are also addicts.
5;Thank Goodness I Can Buy It Here;This is a favorite of a certain family member, and I haven't been able to find it in stores for over a year. I am so happy to have found it can be purchased online.
5;Oh god the delicious candy!;Oh god this candy was delicious, its been to long since I've had any since they stopped selling it in the US. Totally worth the price.
5;fanfreakingtastic;I bought these to give away for Halloween and had over a hundred left so I tried some and they are fantastic. I never knew how good suckers could be.
5;great healthy choice;i have two wonderful boxers we tried the sam's yams several years ago in attempt to get away from the nasty, unhealthy dog chews that are widely sold. these are great.
5;Just like Starbucks with less sugar! Better at home;This is a great powder. It's my first time buying online and attempting to make Green Tea Latte's at home, so I wasn't sure.
5;A Hit!;My grandchildren LOVE the sour gummy vitamins. They really liked the sour gummy worms by Rhino, but alas, I can't find them.
5;Can really tell the difference;This product will give you the boost you need for completing those long workouts (without the stomach pain associated with working out on a full stomach). You do need to find the right flavor for you as there are several.
2;disappointed in cup of gold;Bought this as a surprise birthday gift for my mom who had been craving them but can never find them in stores.  She was excited when she opened up the box, but they were melted and hard to get out of package.
5;Makes great espresso, cappuccino;Not only is this excellent coffee when prepared in conventional coffee makers, but it's my preferred brand and flavor for my 16 ounce mocha cappuccino every morning.<br />I like being able to order it in the three-pack, especially with no shipping charge thanks to my Amazon Prime account, because it assures I have plenty on hand.
5;Plump and Moist;Not what I am used to in a raisin. These are plump and moist, not as withered as most raisins.
4;Good chips, more cheese;They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture.
5;Mom of 2;Great Milk!!!  You can get the case at Sams Club for $12.99 (I have only found the Chocolate there).
2;I wish my toddler liked it;I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet.
5;Excellent Service, Excellent Vendor!;This Vendor JustCaviar, has gone above and beyond any expectation of fullfilling my order.  I placed this same order with another vendor and after a couple of days was told, they could not find the product.
3;Tooo sweet for savory pies!!!!;The description of this product says you can fill it with meats and veggies and the ingredients do not list sugar. I have a hard time believing there is no sugar.
4;Sweet treat;I love to try foreign candies and this one doesn't disappoint. It brings to mind those strawberry wrapper candies with the gel in the center.
5;5 Star Organic value for a classic side dish;"The move to going organic needs to be a smooth transition, especially when you are cooking for more than one person.  Breaking the barrier of ""ewe organic, I don't know."
4;Product 4, packaging 2;I love coffee, and yet I'm not the type of person who distinguishes flavors and aromas generally coffee falls into one of two categories for me - good coffee and garbage coffee.  Good coffee is generally coffee you have to pay for, you get it at a resturant or at a coffee shop, or make it at home.
3;Wrong Item Shipped;I ordered Lemon Blossom tea, but I received Stash MEYER Lemon Blossom tea. This is a very different product and I do not like it as much as the Lemon Blossom.
1;Gluten in Tea!!!;I bought one of the Stash teas-don't remember which one. It contained gluten!  I am gluten intolerant but NEVER expected ANY tea to contain gluten.
5;Delicious;I tried this tea after having a delicious cup of chai tea latte at my favorite caf&eacute
1;Creat-a-treat Gingerbread house;"We were extremely disappointed in this product.  Not only was the Gingerbread tasteless, the gumdrops were dried out and hard as bullets AND there was a piece of WOOD in the bag along with the gumdrops! Can't say anything positive about the company's ""quality control""!<br /><br />I will never purchase this product again."
5;Best;If you have friends who love Earl Grey tea, buy this as a gift for them.  They will thank you over and over.
5;Great topping, too!;"My doctor prescribed yogurt for my diet. For most people that would be fine, but the texture gags me! Using Cocoa Beach as a topping, however, has turned the ""punishment"" to ""pleasure."
3;decent;I like this stuff because it doesn't taste awful and it has the equivalent effect on my body that fiber powder would have on most people. I do feel more calm and sleepy however I Can't sleep when I take it.
5;Better price than the grocery store;I buy my office supplies from Amazon.com.
5;Greek Olive Oil;We have used this extra virgin olive oil for years. It is the best tasting oil for salads, cooking and dipping.
5;Liver treats;My dog is not enthusiastic about food.  She enjoys these treats which are light weight and easy to carry.
5;Incredible Coffee!!;I've loved Dark Magic since I discovered it shortly after buying my Keurig and it is my favorite.  Recently I decided to try decaf and ordered this coffee.
4;Steep It Only Briefly;"Green tea is my favorite tea--and of green teas, genmai is the one I find most delicious.  It's almost sweet, has a bit more body and a less sharp taste than the typical ""green tea"" you get here in the US."
5;Love mint tea;Mint tea has got to be my favorite tea.  I like it before going to sleep, with a little milk and honey.
2;Not a Fan;"I'm not a real fan of this particular Hormel Compleat meal.<br />It smells ""wrong"" after opening and doesn't eat really well."
5;Great Dutch Cheese;I always remember my grandparents and mother, whom were born in Holland, having this cheese around the holidays and I had not had it in such a long time.  It still tastes as great as ever.
5;Satisfied Customer;Delivery was as promised and the merchandise fabulous as usual.  Will buy again.
5;World class chocolate from America;The Scharffen Berger Bittersweet Dark Chocolate Bar is a delicious, delightful chocolate bar.  It's semi-sweet, without really any noticeable bitter taste, and has a smooth, soft texture (at moderate room temperature).
1;Disappointed, but unbowed;I was fully intent on becoming a mole serial killer.  I wanted the very mention of my name to strike fear in generation after generation of the little turds.
5;what's not to like;these snacks are perfect. excellent flavor and very healthy.
5;Great baby food;This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more.
4;Perfect for coffee;I needed something to improve my morning brew.  Since chocolate is my favorite flavor, I tried this.
5;Gluten Free Tortillas;Gluten-Free Flour Tortillas<br />MAKES 6-8 TORTILLAS<br /><br />1 cup white rice flour<br />1/3 cup potato starch<br />1/3 cup tapioca flour<br />1/3 cup fava bean flour<br />2 tsps xanthan gum<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />1/2 tsp sugar<br />1 1/4 tsp salt<br />2 TBs vegetable or other shortening<br />3/4 to 1 cup warm water<br /><br />Combine all of the dry ingredients, then cut in or work in the shortening using a pastry blender or two knives or your hand.<br />Add the warm water, starting with 3/4 cup and mix well.
3;Acidic;This coffee smells great and taste great but I think it is very acidic. One large cup is fine but I usually drink atleast two cups.
5;anise oil;I received the anise oil quickly and the package included a catalog of many other<br />products which the vendor supplies for the kitchen.  I have used the product in two recipes and it is a quality product with a fine aroma and taste.
5;Baby Likes This;We received a nice sized sample of this from Sam's, and it seems to be just fine for baby. I would purchase this if our regular brand was not available.
5;yummy treat;My little dog loves sweet potatoes, so this seemed like the perfect treat.  The 'chips' weren't what I expected, but she loves them.
4;Good french roast bean with lots of flavor;I am a Starbucks coffee drinker for the most part. I enjoy Espressro Roast, Sumatra, French Roast and even Pike's.
5;The dog loves it;I usually feed my dog kibbles and bits but I decided to give Purina a try and it went over very well with my dog. Normally she will only eat a little and then come back and do that on and off till the bowl is gone, with this dog food she stayed there and ate until the whole bowl was gone.
5;Great Snack!;I love these. They are the perfect low-calorie replacement for my high-calorie habit of eating popcorn slathered with butter in the evenings.
5;Delicious and great price;These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.
5;TASTY AND EASY;THIS WAS BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.  THE VARIETY WAS A GREAT BLEND OF DIFFERENT SOUPS AND SO EASY TO FIX.
5;Very Good;I have been looking for the Wyler's Light Raspberry locally for a long time and was happy to see it available on here. Smooth transaction and everything was as described.
5;great tasting soup;My local grocery store had this product at one time, but I couldn't get them to order it again.  I ordered from Amazon because the soup is so good, I really wanted it for winter.
5;Truly is Wonderful;This bread rivals regular gluten bread.  I bought for my autistic son who has a special diet, but whole family enjoys it.
5;My favorite flavor;We really enjoyed this coffee. Love buying in the bulk package.
5;wonderful;The service was wonderful and the fudge was delicious and the many choices of flavors was great.I highly recommend this as a gift to send.
1;Terrible!!! This syrup was from a bad tree.;We always buy expensive syrup, either labeled organic or pure maple. I ordered this brand based on the testimonials.
5;Good for soapmaking;This coconut oil is perfect for soapmaking.  Anyone who has used coconut oil should know that it remains in a solid form if the temperature is under 76 degrees so I am not sure why that would be a negative.
5;Kitties Are Finicky;Anyone owned by cats knows that they can be very finicky and might turn up their little noses at the best food while happily scarfing down food filled with nasty-sounding things like poultry digest.<br /><br />My two cats eat a popular, grocery-store-variety, canned cat food in the morning and have dry available to them the rest of the time.
5;Fabulous Product;This powder is super! I feel so confident using it knowing that there are no chemicals in it that will absorb into my sons skin. It smells great, works wonderfully.
5;So simple and good;I found this product locally at our Albertson's several years ago.  They stopped carrying it.
1;NOTHING;I took this stuff and nothing, maybe a little bit more alert other than that , No energy, And let two friend's try it. For them NOTHING also.
5;Healthy Snacks;These crackers are healthier for you than most, and yet are very tasty and light.  I really enjoy them.
5;Nice and thick;"This is a 30"" window box planter tray for the Akro-Mils flower box. I got both this and the Fiskars one and in comparison this one is nice and thick."
2;Item is great but very concerned. . . .;First I want to say that this company has fabulous customer service!  My item was originally lost/delayed in the mail due to no fault of the seller's.  They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.
5;Good Dog Food;I'm not sure what has twisted the tales of other reviewers, this is fine dog food.  I was worried I had missed something and checked the contents of other dog foods I trust- namely Kirkland Signature adult dog food (some say Diamond makes it for Costco).
2;Just does not taste good :(;I have bought Artichoke Bruschetta spread at Costco and I have made it myself. I love the stuff.
4;Great cup of coffee;I have enjoyed this coffee right from the start. Quick, easy, and great tasting.
2;What happened???;When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.
4;Crisp and refreshing;This water tastes clean, crisp, and refreshing. It's filtered, so it doesn't leave an aftertaste and doesn't really taste like anything-in my book, that's good water! It's also supposedly infused with electrolytes, but I don't know how you'd notice that since it just looks/tastes like normal filtered water.
4;tried this new cat food;We only buy grain free cat food. we thought the ingredients and ratings would make this a nice option to try for the sake of variety.
4;Great formula, easy to use -- wish it was available through subscribe-and-save;We discovered after trying to use a dairy based formula that our daughter had a dairy sensitivity. My sister-in-law suggested alimentum and it worked wonders.
5;Midnight;Midnight loves gravy and this is about the only product that has near enough to satisfy her. Therefore I am happy as long as it continues to have a lot of gravy.
3;Not your best bet if you want smoky paprika - try another brand;Well, I ordered three tins of smoked paprika, one each of sweet, bittersweet and hot.<br />I love the smokiness and flavor it imparts to dishes, and wanted to try some other<br />strengths.
5;K-Cups from Amazon;The convenience and speed with the shipping of these k-cups makes you hardly notice you ever ran out. The cups are free from damage and easy to open and get to when received.
5;vet recommended;My Boston is 12 yrs old. Two years ago, he developed a skin condition characterized by flaking, excessive itching and bald spots on his coat.
5;My dogs love this.;These are easy to use, break into smaller pieces much more easily than other like products.  Tasty and yet not too pungent, my dogs are very happy to see me reach for them, and want to do what I ask more quickly with these as rewards.
3;A tasty meat snack;Jack Link's makes some of the best meat snacks around and these were no exception. Very tasty and surprisingly a good deal.
5;Lower cost, great quality;Tried this as an option as the traditional plastic cups concerned me. The design of these cups reduces the amount of plastic substantially - probably by 80-90%.
5;Love these;Not nearly as clunky, heavy, and hard to eat as a Clif Bar, these are a great source of fuel during a long bike ride. And they taste great - not too sweet, but just enough flavor unlike some other fuel sources.
5;good coffee;this coffee is excellent and the price can't be beat the cup looks different from most kcups but it works perfect and is really good coffee.I have it on auto shipments and that makes it even a better buy.
5;Love this stuff!;Unlike the medical establishment, I have come to believe that fats in general are NOT harmful OR fattening!  There are so many different types if fat, they should not all be lumped together.  Avoid the long chain saturated fats (animal fats), but short chain saturated fats (like butter, palm, and coconut) are fine.
3;Taste kind of strange....;To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili.
5;Loyal Earths Best Customer;I absolutely love Earths Best foods. They have the largest variety of organic foods at the best prices.
5;Cafe D'Vita SF Mocha Cappuccino.  I love it!;What a great sugar free treat.  Also tastes great with no sugar added vanilla ice cream.
5;Great value product that is full of protein;We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones.
3;Coffee is okay....not great.;Recently ordered some Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-cups and found the coffee to be only okay, not great.  There is very little hazelnut flavor and the coffee is on the bitter side.
5;Yummy;This granola is sooo good. It is great on yogurt!!! You will not feel deprived with this, as it is as good as any granola on the market.
5;YUM;OMG YUMMY!!  really! So good, it's like sugar free magic in a bottle.  I was hesitant thinking it may be chalky like many similar products, but it is simply devine.
5;Great for my Miniature Schnauzer;"I bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and I feed her a heaping cup everyday. Also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills <a href=""http://www."
5;Great cereal bars....at home or on the go...;Handy little tasty goodness for go-lunches for adults or grab something easy at home with coffee. Boxes arrived in good shape and bars are nicely moist.
5;Great Stuff!;"I have used this product for years but this is the first time I have purchased the sugar free. I make ""frappuccinos' by adding ice, sugar free chocolate syrup, and put all in the blender."
1;Tastes like coconut water from a fresh coconut stored in a plastic jug in the trunk of your car for a few days!;I've spent at least a hundred bucks on the old Zico boxes.  Those were metal lined, the juice was not from concentrate.
1;Gross!!!;It tastes absolutely horrible..
3;Good flavor but shy on lobster;Overall this soup is good, however sadly we found the lobster, corn and potatoes to be almost nonexistent. The flavor itself was good
5;Thai Coconut Ginger Soup;"""WOW"".."
5;Yummmmmm;This biscotti is graced with a thin layer of limon (lemon) frosting sweetness.  Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min.
5;Very nice coffee blend;I started drinking coffee only about a month or so ago, but I was interested in trying some finer coffees.  This blend was very nice, with a nice rich coffee flavor without all the bitterness you would find with cheaper coffee.
5;Best GF Granola!;I thought I was going to have to give up granola once I went gluten free.  The other granolas I tried, well, let just say they tasted like they should be 'good for me'.
2;Do not tast good;I do not like this cereal. Added milk and sugar and still no good.
3;Was just alright.;Didn't blow my mind, but was good for being made with stevia.  Could definitely be used in cooking, but it wasn't very soft and didn't bring out the essence of the dark chocolate along with the touch of sweetness.
5;Great Flavor;These have a superb flavor for a low-glycemic product. That's 'low-glycemic' if you pay attention to the standard serving size, which is a generous 10 chips.
5;The Best  Brand Around!!!;Annies is the best brand of Mac and Cheese. We always keep some on hand.
4;These are a little unusual but tasty.;I was looking online to find out if these were sugar free. The wrapper didn't say that.
4;What's not to like?;Judging from the prior reviews, Mallomars have apparently been around for a while. Which is strange, because I have never seen nor experienced them.
5;It's surprisingly good!;I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing.
3;Not the best;The tea is ok but the tea bags are better. I think you need to brew tea longer to have it taste the way it should.
5;Perfect Breadcrumbs=Perfect Food Everytime!;I love these breadcrumbs.  They make everything taste great.
5;Quality product, cats love it, but the smell is very strong...;My cats love this food but the smell of the ocean fish and tuna is awful. Be sure to feed it in a well ventilated area! The strong smell might be a plus if you have a cat without much of an appetite, it seems to smell very enticing to cats.
5;My favorite boxed pasta;"The delivery man laughed when he shook the box and I told him it was ""macaroni"" but, oh, yes, these are worth ordering online.  They are toothsome and flavorful."
4;A very good sampler if you are giving a Keurig as a gift;It's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.
3;Kills Dogs;I have Not tasted It, I think Its comes from Mexico or something, when I bought It I was looking for something different more natural the closest I have found Is Ghirardelli and even Its Not very good It does Not taste as good as Nestle hot chocolate but does Not have all that unknown stuff which may be made from Animals with mad cow disease but still have to microwave It to kill the bacteria. My yellow lab that was always hungry and a scavenger just like My Cat tore open a can and died a few hours later, I do Not understand It I have had Dogs and Cats before and Never had a problem feeding Them.
5;Skinny, Picky Poodle has gained a pound on this stuff;I was able to add a full pound to my skinny, 15yr old toy poodle with this.  He loves it and looks forward to dinner again.
5;Good price;I ordered 8 cans of Earth's Best Organic formula and I got them in time as scheduled. We have been using it since my daughter was 2 weeks old.
5;Going in circles;My dogs love this treat, I buy it all the time.<br />One of the dogs spins around when he sees that<br />I'm giving him the Dingo treat.
5;SUPER!;I really enjoyed this Maple Syrup and recommend it highly. I will purchase it again.
5;Great Amazon baby subscription service & great product;Our daughter loved this formula. We used this formula for the 6 months or so.
3;An OK off the shelf product;As at least one other reviewer has noted this product is a bit difficult to review given the fact I have not eaten any. Thus, I dont know for sure about the taste, etc.
2;Nothing new.;This product is a mix between honey o's with flavor bits stuck to them. I'd rather go for plain o's or something with a bit more flavor.
5;Incredible;I'm from Seattle and moving overseas where coffee isn't  so available.  I like my mochas in the morning.
5;my dog loves these;My dog has always loved these, but because they were cheaper and available at the local market - for a while I was buying her generic biscuits.  Well, it turns out the poor dog has major food allergies! Now these are all I get for her.
5;perfect;This a a perfect solution to my creamer needs. I do not have to refrigerate it.
4;When they work...they are great!;I've had years of experience pilling my various cats. I always swore by a combination pill gun and fill-em-yourself #3 gelcaps.
4;NICE EXTRA FOR THE PARTY!;"I USED THIS AS A ""PROP"" AT MY MOTHER'S 68TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.  IT ADDED A NICE TOUCH TO THE TABLE."
5;All your essential amino acids in a little seed!!;I love Nutiva Hempseed!!  Not only are they a delicious whole food, chock full of raw nutrients, but these little seeds are so versatile - you can use them in so many dishes.  Sprinkle them on fruit and vegetable salads or soups, use them in smoothies, create a creamy dressing with them by blending with water and your favorite herbs and spices or just simple blend with water and strain for nut/seed milk.
5;No high fructose corn syrup.;I never grew out of eating peanut butter nearly all the time as a kid and now I've got no reason to. Between the lack of high fructose corn syrup and a list of ingredients I can pronounce and about which I know a thing or two, I'm quite pleased.
5;How do I get cooking like this at home?;Seriously, this stuff actually looks like something humans could eat.  When you open the can, it looks and smells like real (canned) food, not pressed and formed mystery meat or worse, meat paste.
4;Low calorie alternative;Finally got my shipment today and was very anxious to try PB2 due to all the rave reviews.I found it to be pretty tasty but found it to be lacking the true pb and chocolate taste.
5;Always fresh!;These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work.
5;So unbelievably delicious;These cookies are a chocolate lover's dream.  They do not taste like packaged cookies at all- and I can't even tell they are gluten free.
5;Simply Outstanding!;I love a balsamic reduction, but find it too time consuming to make very often. For everyone who may be like I was a couple of years ago, this is balsamic vinegar that has been simmered until much of it evaporates, making it very thick.
4;Cant believe its decaf!!;I am a strictly caffeine free coffee drinker. I have tried many different brands.
2;Did not last!;I bought this product for my fiance for Easter.  It was gift to get her excited about up coming trip to Quebec.
5;great product;Could not be any happier with this product! I love putting peanut butter on a banana for a filling snack and now I can have it for a whole lot less fat and calories. Raw energy.
1;The bags were damaged with holes and stains.;The chips were great..
3;Real fruit, yes  -  but real sweet, too.  No, I mean REAL sweet;The biggest selling point for Florida's Natural Fruit Nuggets is that they actually contain fruit.  Faint praise?  Not for me
4;SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style;Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.
5;Great price for a good product;The product always arrives on time and is well packaged to prevent damage.  I am set up on automatic shipments to save additional money.
5;Great Snack!!!;When I first purchased this pouch, I didn't realize how good it would be. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!! Got hooked tho had a hard time locating it here in LA so I googled it and found it on Amazon.
5;Great flavor!!;Fantastic flavor, robust with a slightly smokey taste
5;Will buy again;Taste great. Will be using it for tea and mixing ACV.
1;Nanas Coconut Chip Cookies;I was disappointed when I opened my first cookie that was ordered from Amazon.  Although I am still eating them, they were stale.
5;Great for my older Border Collie;"Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on ""Subscribe and Save"" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain."
5;Unbeatable flavour and taste;"You know I love my English Breakfast (see my earlier 5 star review of Twinings English Breakfast) -- but my greatest delight is Earl Grey tea -- with its deep, smokey, heavy (but not burdensome) mysterious wonderful flavors that linger hauntingly on the tongue and bring sublime moments of joy into a grey day (no pun intended). Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a ""Chai presence""!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again."
2;Betty Crocker Warn Delights;I would not buy them again, but if you are desperate for a dessert and don't have anything else prepared, it would probably satisfy your cravings.  Don't plan to serve it to guests though.
5;Delicious;This stuff is delicious.  People are comparing it to Nutella, but it was far superior.
5;The only food I will feed my dogs!;I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.
5;Chiclets gum;We bought this product for special treats for the grandchildren.  My wife and I grew up with Chiclets (full size) and when we found this product on line at Amazon, we just had to have it.
5;BIG On Peanuts! BIG On Taste!;"My family & I tried Planters Big Nut Bars for the first time.  My 15 year old daughter absolutely hates any type of granola bar and/or those so-called ""health"" bars - associating their products to an icky blend of what she'd imagine cat litter blended with sawdust would taste like."
1;Surprise 1  It's different...;Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.  These chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty.
1;worst decision ever;I thought this was going to be a great product but once I received it, it was broken.  Dave's Gourmet said this is something that commonly happens with this product.
3;Mixed results;Maybe I just don't have a green thumb, but I can barely get these things to grow, let alone stay alive for any decent amount of time.  My cat won't touch them after about a week.
5;Excellent cat food;My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.
4;Not Scottish At All, Just Good English Tea;The last time I visited Scotland was 1999 when I led a couple of my Birmingham wrestlers to the Isle of Bute to participate in the Scottish Highland Games.  What I remember most besides wrestling upon slippery wet grass was drinking the best cup of hot tea ever!  So I was keen to relive those bone-warming memories and recently bought a box of Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast Tea via Amazon.
5;How can so little work SO WELL?;I recently purchased the multi-pack of pomegranate 5 Hour Energy shots for a driving trip, because I know that after only an hour on the road, I tend to fall asleep at the wheel.  When I have eight hours of driving ahead of me, that's not the safest place to be.
5;YummyEarth...Yummy in your Tummy;Can't say enough good stuff about these delicious lollipops. All the flavors are YUMMY and the kids LOVE them.
1;Very disappointed. Tasted very stale compared to when purchasing directly from company.;The roasting date was very old resulting in stale tasting coffee. I love Kicking Horse Coffee but this was a bad batch.
5;hot cocoa;I ordered this as a christmas present for my Daughter and Son in law. He tried it the day after Christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.
5;TRIPLE THUMBS UP!;"Reviewed by a true-blue Singaporean living in the US, this is a must have treat for those who miss the authentic flavors of south east asia! Tried the other more ""inexpensive"" version by Asian Home Gourmet but it was no comparison. The Prima Taste laksa broth is definitely alot more authentic and taste just like the morning/lunch hawker fare in Singapore."
5;So convenient!;I love with this boxed tofu I can have it on hand at anytime and not risk spoilage (or space) in the fridge! I've used it in soups, stews, stir fries, pan-fried and deep-fried tofu dishes. It's a softer than the fresh tofu in the store but does the job! I go through phases where I eat lots of tofu or none at all, so the long shelf-life factor has been really important to me.
5;The best I have used.;I was first introduced to Cytomax during a half-marathon in Nashville, Tennessee. I was impressed then by its performance and I continue to be 18 months later.
5;Excellent natural popcorn;Natural, butter-free microwave popcorn is becoming very hard to find.  Thank goodness Newman's Own follows its usual high quality with this product.
5;Great Price.  Free shipping!;My kids love the cooler version of Capri Sun.  What made my purchase a great experience was that it was cheap and included free shipping, which is a huge deal because 4 boxes of Capri Sun is heavy.
5;This stuff is kitty crack;The BFF line is great
5;I love these;very good ..
4;tasty coffee, with additional novelty value;"These coffee pods are probably intended for use in one of the  single serve  coffee machines. There were no instructions anywhere, they do have ""This side down"" on the pod but there was nothing on the box, outer pouch  or in the product description that indicated that the pods were not  the (identically appearing) coffee pods that are directly immersed in water."
2;No taste or flavor;I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required.
3;1 seed;The kit was ok not expected when it came in the mail. The seeds looked damaged and the potting soil was horrible.
1;Worst Shipping EVER;I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable.
5;Great tasting pistachio nuts;I often eat these as a snack before or after dinner. The pistachios are nice and meaty, not dry, lightly salted (just the right amount) and most are easy to open.
5;Excellent Cookies;
3;Falls a bit bit short;The packaging is exceptional. I really did like the re-sealable bag.
5;Great for a gift;I ordered this for my cousin while she was at summer camp to surprise her. I ordered it as a gift so it had no indication as to who got it for her.
5;Good;I don't understand why so many reviewers are being so negative about the product. I mean anyone can tell by doing just a little research these are dry and tasteless on their own and many tell you to add topping.
5;Stash Meyer Lemon Tea;Stash tea's are a quality tea.  Meyer Lemon makes a wonderful iced tea.
5;Sparkling Ice;Love this stuff. What nice alternative to soda and/or plain water
5;How do you do Nutella?;I toast a cinnamon raisin bagel, slather with peanut butter, add Nutella all around but just along the outside edge..
4;Flavorful Product but Gianormous Packaging;I agree with the previous reviewer that the packaging of these grilled eggplants is a bit overwhelming, but there are other, smaller packages available (from the same manufacturer) that make removing the eggplant slices easier. And they are delicate, but that's what grilled eggplant is, and if you are careful, the pieces will remain intact.
5;I like 'em;They are salty (but not too much so) and crunchy and have a sufficient amount of nutrition. I don't waste them on salads--just eat them right out of the bag.
5;Great taste.;Rich, great tasting dark coffee. Not bitter at all.
4;Very good;It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal. I'm a little torn on what I think of packages like this - I am glad they are BPA free, and they are convenient for when we're out and about, but in general I prefer glass containers that we can recycle or reuse.
1;Very surprised by all the positive feedback...;I don't typically eat processed foods but I was sold on their mission statement of offering convenient, healthy, delicious meals made with only natural and organic ingredients (100% Natural, No MSG, No Preservatives).  I bought several to keep at my office, unfortunately, these Noodle Bowls are just barely edible in my opinion.
4;Saeco Vienna Espresso Maker;I received this espresso maker as a gift. Although I like the look and style of the machine and how easy it is to make a quick espresso what I don't like is that the espresso is never hot.
5;Celebrate;Third time I have ordered this product and it always arrives quickly. Love this candy, wish I knew where to pick it up locally to prevent postage, but so be it.
5;My 2 yr old's favorite treat!;My 2 year old gets so excited when I give him one of these, you would think it was candy!  Travels extremely well.  Has never made a mess.
5;Great treat for your best friend;I am sure my dog could do a better review but seeing as he can't type, I will try to translate.  My dog(Welsh Terrier) is actually a very picky eater and only likes a handful of things.
5;Great value and fresh product;I forgot to review this when I got it. What a great deal! I use alot of celery seed in different things I cook and am very pleased with this.
4;there super fun;not the best smoking tool but works..
4;Cranberry Chutney;Very tasty.  My wife, Jeanie, loves the tartness.
1;Tough Cardboard Crackers;It is not my intent to write a overly pessimistic review but, I can't believe these crackers got past the marketing department. They literally taste like cardboard that got wet and was dried.
5;Milk Protien Allergy;My 13 month old has been on Nutramigen since just about birth. She is unable to digest anything that has a milk base
3;Medicinal Taste;i essentially wanted honey as a sugar substitute for Tea, this honey has a medicinal taste and alters the flavor of tea. if you are looking for a healthier sugar substitute in honey get the white gold honey instead.
5;My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff;I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish.
1;DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT Eeeeew;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Mediterranean Oregano is simply the best!;This is excellent oregano and the only kind I like to use for my Italian dishes as well as Mexican, Spanish, Portuguese etc. 'Mediterranean' dishes.
5;I love these chips.  They are thick and crunchy!;These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.
4;Melitta Ground Decaf Coffee;This is the best ground decaf coffee I've found.  It's too bad it only comes in small cans.
5;Pretty good dark roast;I wasn't expecting much of this product given that I generally don't like Green Mountain Coffee, but to my surprise this was a very good tasting dark roast. It has a strong flavor and nice aroma but not too bitter or watered down.
4;Soy-less protein bars that taste good...;I was looking for some protein bars that taste good and were soyless. These come close (soy lethicin is still listed).
4;Keeps Cats Out!;I use Critter Ridder to keep cats from using my garden as a litter box.  It works, though it requires liberal sprinkling over the first three feet of the border which gets expensive (thus, 4 stars).
5;Wellness Chicken Stew;The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.
5;The best nonfat sauce EVER.;I can't get enough of this stuff, it's hot but mildly so and goes on just about anything. This is basically the asian version of ketchup, but 10x better.
3;Tastes horrible;I never drink energy drinks since i don't really believe in them but tried the Wild Berry flavor because it was essentially given to me for free. Tastes atrocious.
3;Wellness Core adult and kitten food;This is indeed a much better alternative to the mainstream dry cat food. No dyes, (which is more and more the cause of vomiting in cats), no significant carbs-a key cause of feline diabetes which is on the rise also.
4;My Cats ate them...says enough!;My 14yr old orange tabby Rusty had to have a tooth pulled so we've been looking for treats to clean my 3 cats' teeth vs having to brush their teeth for them as recommended by the Vet. Rusty's not one for the brushing thing.
1;Whoa fish;"I am always looking for ways to get in Omega-3's and find a lot of pills to incur those ""fishy"" burps hours after taking them plus the routine of remembering to take the pills daily.  I love tea both hot and iced so I was quite excited to try this one."
4;Awesome product. But CRAZY expensive.;My dog LOVES this stuff. He wasn't eating his regular food and I got this and crumbled one burger on top and he attacked it! Also he is a nervous stomach kind of dog but there was barely any upset when I introduced this food.
5;Amazing Grass Green SuperFood, 60-Servings, 17-Ounce Tub;LOVE the product. GREAT price.
5;My Cat Has Enjoyed Petite Cuisine;Naturally this review is based upon my cat's intake of Petite Cuisine. She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that.
1;Crazy k cup sampler;Was advertised as coffee sampler. What I got was mostly tea.
1;newmans own canned cat food;3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this.  Pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat.
3;Good stuff, but not worth the price;This stuff is straight-up delicious and with 0 calories what's to complain about? Well, the cost for one. These are like $4 each at our local walmart and even more expensive on amazon.
2;Mini Chips are NOT little cookies;"I saw the chocolate chip cookies on the image, and I wanted gluten-free dairy-free chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />The problem, is that these ""mini chips"" are miniature chocolate chips."
5;Yogi Pom Green Tea;This is my favorite tea. Sweet and a bit tart, delicious also as an iced tea.
5;LOVE THIS ICE-CREAM!!;I have an ice cream maker at home, which has been gathering dust for a while.<br />I came across this product and thought to give it a try.
5;Incredible and Incredibly Addictive!;I love these Cashews.  However, they are evil!  I can not open a bag when I am alone because then I end up eating the whole bag by myself in one sitting.
5;Paper bag instead of plastic;Previously when I had ordered this rice it came in a fully sealed plastic bag. I loved the rice and that is why I ordered more.
3;'it's okay' about sums it up;A bit ambivalent about this drink, as it has its pros and cons.  The fruit punch has a nice flavor to it, not too sweet but about what you'd expect for a flavor enhancer.
3;NOT as good as the ones in the tins;"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness."
5;You say tomato, I say amazing;What Hope said, lol. This sauce is amazing, the 16-oz size is perfect, and it's great for so many recipes or just plain with some nice pasta.
5;Delicious!;These are really-really good! Take it from a person who tried all the best sugar free stuff there is. It's so good,you won't regret the pricey shipping even.
5;Addicted;Love this stuff. Have tried other brands and the refrigerated brand but Coffee-Mate Vanilla caramel beats them all.
4;Good but could have been perfect!;The chocolate are absolutely delicious however when they arrived, they were somewhat melted.  It should have been packed in some sort of temperature cooling packaging and sent overnight.
5;Furniture Saver!!!;We bought one of these when our corgi Faye was teething. She was chewing on everything, the couch, dvd boxes, the windowsills! She took to the Chilly Bone immediately.
5;My dog loves this!;As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy.
4;Delicious!;My wife is diabetic.  On a recent ospital stay, she was served these cookies on her tray.
4;Gave them a whirl and they're all right;I didn't want to buy them in bulk before trying them out. I've been sorry before.
4;Good combination of  healthy ingredients;This granola is very fresh and tasty.  I liked the idea that it had walnuts, quinoa and chia seeds.
4;Good snack;I'm pretty happy with these snacks.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the bags had more air than anything-else.
1;aweful;I must be genetically able to taste a chemical in this product that the people who gave it stars can not.<br /><br />This substance tastes like screaming death.
2;Where's the jazz?;I found this coffee to be very blah and boring. I gave away most of the box and would not order it again.
5;Great snack when on the go;My kiddos have always turned their nose up at fruit leather but love this.  I love to keep these in the car for a quick healthy snack.
4;a-ok;We need this for a recipe my wife is interested to trying.  However, we<br />have not gotten around to doing it yet.
2;This should be more appealing to dogs... duck please!;Can we please get these soaked in duck blood or something?  My yorkie won't touch these unless I tickle her fur in an irritating manner so that she wants to bite it..
5;I really like Folgers Instant Coffee, and it's Good Cold for Ice Coffee;For instant coffee I think this is the best brand out there.<br /><br />I see one of the 3 star reviewers wondered if the 5 star reviewer realized they were reviewing instant.
3;The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.;The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.
1;Tastes funky;"We bought this as a fake non dairy, ""natural"" creamer for coffee, just tastes wierd, I'll leave it at that.."
1;Dangerous food;I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.
5;The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?;"The ""Jalapeno Smokehouse"" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers."
3;Love the Idea But Not as Great in Practice for Us;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Tucker was nervous about this toy at first (as you'll see in the video) but really warmed up to it quickly and has enjoyed gnawing on it.  However, this has not worked very well for us as a treat dispenser."
3;Banged up cans;Product arrived on time, but about 6 of the 24 cans were banged up pretty good.  Nothing spilled, but tough to drink.
3;Yeah, I can't use these...;Receiving coffee pods was a first for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to do with these.
3;Okay;This isn't a bad lunch, but a bit lacking in flavor.  Be sure to use boiling water and leave it well covered for the full five minutes.
5;Excellent Sercive;Received my delicious order of pretzels and chocolate in time! Communication was excellent and the product was fantastic. As long as she sells them I will buy them.
1;Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame,;Maybe they're an acquired taste. I don't know, but I'm working on it.
5;A little pricey, but ohhhhh so good!;I get these every year at Christmas to go with all the usual home-baked goodies.  These are very thin crisp spicy cookies, with tons of flavor in a small size.
5;Delicious;It taste great! It has a great smokey flavor and taste great on burgers,chicken,pork and fish.  And although the container is small, a little goes a long way.
3;GOOD but not Great;"The reason I bought this "" besides the three 5 star reviews "" was my wife and I love fresh Wild Nova Scotia Canadaian salmon in a dairy package that we get in our local supermarket. We thought this would be similar with the convenience of a spread in a small can."
5;Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic K-cups;This is the best K-cup coffee we've ever tried.  My husband and I like coffee - not colored water - and this definitely fits the bill for us.
5;Nonshim soup;My husband is crazy about this soup.  Hard to find where we live.
5;saved my Keurig;I was so disappointed when I tried my new Keurig.  The coffee was weak and some of it tasted like bad diner coffee.
5;mm mm good;we have a hard time finding this wonderful soup in our local stores, so i went online and found it, even had $.99 shipping.
3;Tastes like strawberry chalk;I bought this 24-Count box of Extreme Berries over six months ago to liven up bottled water for my long stays on campus. I didn't really consider the purported health benefits and I think I snagged them when they were discounted.
5;Awesome with some grilled chicken.....;If you want to add a little kick and lots of flavor to your chicken then I recommend this.  Yes it can be used with other meats, fish, and veggies - but personally I think it was best on grilled Chicken.
5;YUMMMMM!!;Ok, I have to admit when I opened up the box..
5;best feline cat food;My cats love this food.  They pick at other brands or won't eat it at all so I decided to try this brand.
4;Great chips, but...;I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn.
5;Get Rid of The Sugar;Excellent product.  Low glycemic index.
5;Stash Christmas Morning Tea;I love the flavor of this tea.  It's wonderful for the whole year, not just Christmas time.
5;Stunning Flavor and Antioxidants Too;Flavorful and full-bodied, this tea is made from green tea leaves flavored with a hint of pomegranate and raspberry.  It is caffeinated but does not bother me at all the way caffeine in coffee does.
5;Love these!;The flavor of these is definitely what stands out immediately to me. Most healthy snack bars have either an unappetizing or bland flavor.
3;Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.;We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip.
5;A very good buy;The 6 bottles of white wine vinegar in the case arrived in excellent condition. I use them to make herb vinegars and each one is perfect for making one bottle.
5;Outstanding Quality - Complements from the Carnivores!!;I looked all over the city here in Portland, Oregon and could not find a good tasting veggie gravy mix.  Then, a friend suggested Hain Brown Gravy Mix.
5;Excellent;I am a sardine lover from way back, but have to eat them sparingly as my wife often threatens to throw me out of the house if I eat them when she's home.  However, in a fit of weakness and husbandly sneakiness I ordered these based on the previous Amazon reviews.
5;Very tasty;For fans of black licorice and Ouzo/Oghi, this candy is for you. Very natural tasting and a nice and interesting change from the usual mint.
1;Mango Macadamia - Strange taste;This bar just tastes plain weird.<br />There.
5;Very Good Cat Food...;I have been using this particular cat food for over ten years.  I have NEVER observed one of my cats (2) throw-up a hairball, nor have I ever seen a hairball in the house anywhere.
2;no quality consistency;The first time I ordered this it was heavenly.  The beans were dark brown and oily, smell divine, and the brew was caramely, smooth and perfect!<br />So, I splurged and ordered another bag and claimed that it would be my weekend coffee.
5;Great tasting;These are super high quality wafers. I have had many kinds and this brand is the best I have ever had.
5;Amazon vs. Starbucks;1. I love Starbucks coffee.
4;Nice chocolate;I bought this for my husband for valentine's day. He said he liked the chocolate and the packaging was nice.
5;Excellent and Safe Transaction on Amazon Marketplace;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Best quality & taste ever!!!;Canned peach is one of my favorite foods. I have been eating these for a long time.
4;Bold, rich coffee but not as advertised;The coffee itself was great, and at less then $15 for over 3lb's it is a incredible bargain. The main thing you should know if you buy it though is that although it is categorized under whole bean coffee, it is ground.
5;Surprisingly Awesome;I was a huge skeptic when this first came out but no longer.  I can't get over how good this instant coffee tastes.
2;"Not a big fan, a bit too watered down (though it is a ""larger"" cup)";I like my coffee somewhat strong, so maybe this is a bit unfair, but this seemed a bit too watered down (and I'm comparing this to other lighter-regular blend coffees I get on the street other than Starbuck$..
3;Fun gift;"I really hope people out there don't think this is a replacement for actual water. As it states in the product description ""Great novelty or gag gift item that others will talk about for years to come"" please don't be fooled into thinking this will hydrate you."
5;Too good to be true!;If youv'e never tried these, I feel for you!  These are THE best snack you can imagine!  They are good for you, chocolate coated and they taste terrific!<br />There's nothing more really to say except, order from Amazon and not direct from the company.  Better price and customer service.
3;Not too bad, not that good -;They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor.
4;Pretty tasty!;I ended up picking these up by accident, thinking that these were unrolled anchovies that I could throw on a pizza & eat. (My fault for not looking more closely.
3;Meh;"We have a pair of boxers and decided to give these a shot.  While they are 6"" - 7"" in length, as advertised, they are much skinnier than the chews we get in the pet stores, and not much of a bargain to justify the difference."
5;My Dog's Favorite Snack!;I was first introduced to this snack at my dog's training classes at petco. He really enjoys them! The pieces are really tiny but you can tell that it is made from quality ingredients (it also smells really bad), but my dog loves it.
5;Best cookie ever!!!;This is the best cookie I have ever had.  The shipping was prompt and everything was packed very well so it all remained in tact.
5;Healthy and delicious!;My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic.
2;The product is good--the price is ridiculous;I feel kind of foolish that I've been buying this Nori from Amazon for a while now.  To be fair, the Edozen Nori brand does taste great and is easy to work with when making sushi rolls.
5;Wonderful Flavored Brew!;I'm not the biggest fan of flavored coffee, because it's rare that I get one that I actually like.  But Starbucks Natural Fusions Cinnamon is my exception.
5;Lots and lots of gum!;Very large sized package.  Well worth the money.
5;Yummy;Shipped quickly.  The candy was fresh and tasted great.
3;Candy;This wasn't the best candy I've ever had but it was OK.<br /> The delivery was good and fast.
1;not a good idea to order too many;My son loves these, I ordered 1 box of bananas (12 bottles), 1 box of pears, 1 box of apples and blueberries.  To my dismay, it arrived as 2 boxes of bananas .
5;Love this stuff!;The office can't go go without this or the grapefruit flavor.  It is low in sodium and doesn't have all the additives of some other sparkling water products.
5;Similar to Frank's Hot Sauce;This is a much cheaper substitute for Frank's Hot Sauce. The tastes are very close.
5;A flavor for all occasions;Although expensive, I like the idea of being able to try products from different companies.  In the future I will order only those I liked from this variety pack.
5;Old Fasioned Sodas Made With Cane Sugar.;The other day I purchased a 12-bottle case of Vintage Soda that I found at Costco and reviewed it. The selling point was that each of the four brands (Dad's Root Beer, Bubble Up, Nesbit's Orange and Nu Grape Soda) are made with cane sugar, rather than high fructose corn syrup and, as such resemble the good old fashioned drinks we used to enjoy.
4;Coffee tastes very good, price is lower than supermarket brands;This is an excellent bargain.  the coffee tastes good.
4;Cute, but No Instructions!;I sent this to my Mom as a gift and she called to gush about how cute it was.  Unfortunately, the box contained the bonsai tree and nothing else.
5;caviar anyone?  Amazon.com to the rescue;This is a delightful little treat and I look forward to it's delivery.  It's a nice everyday caviar that seems to be enjoyed by all ages.
5;Great Milk Choclate, Hot Cocoa;I love chocolate everything and have purchased and used three brands of hot cocoa, from Amazon, in our Keurig K-cup brewer which was a 2011 Christmas gift. The best milk chocolate flavor consumed was Cafe Escapes followed by Grove Square and totally unacceptable Green Mountain Coffee, Hot cocoa, which went to our local refuse hauler.
5;I mix 4 decaf green tea bags ..delicious;I use this Vanilla Sleepytime and the decaf green tea bags.  I put 4 of each in a 2qt pitcher of water at night.
5;Popular at my house;I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house.
5;An amazing tea!;I am an avid tea drinker & this one tops most. The aroma alone is enough to make me want to steep a cup.
2;Not the best Larabar;I really like Larabars in general and was stoked to get blueberry ones, but these don't taste like blueberries at all. They're more like unsalted cashews that have a weird sweetness to them.
5;A mommy must-have!;A 1% milk that does NOT have to be refrigerated?  I first started buying these when I was pregnant 5 years ago.  Then, I continued to buy them for my daughter (great to take anywhere, no need for juices or sodas).
5;Pretty good;Well this plant came in a ziplock bag and the roots was wrapped around a moist paper towel so don't worry abt ur plant dying or anything and alot of I guess sphagnum moss in the box , it also came with a little black with holes pot , small. The plant has alot of little I guess traps and the tentacles are very red and they look healthy .
5;Gustafs Licorice;Yum!  They may have changed the packaging, but the product is still wonderful.  I can't wait to order more.
3;Chewing gum;The bottle was much smaller then I expected. The gum itself is OK, but too small and way too expensive for my plebeian tastes.
5;Cat goes nuts for this stuff;My cat goes absolutely nuts for Wellness Chicken & Herring!!  It is grain free and high quality.  I've thoroughly researched cat food and this is the best quality at a decent price.
5;Great Spiace;This is a very good spice to add primarily to beef but can be used on other items such as chicken as well.  Not hot but tasty.
5;Great for when you want to make a single glass of Kool-Aid;I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it.
5;My Cat Loves Them!;My vet turned me on to these years ago.  Since brushing my cat's teeth is not an option, I give him one of these every night before going to bed.
5;THE BEST Turkey Jerky;SnackMasters Teriyaki Turkey Jerky has the best flavor of any jerky I have eaten, and the texture is perfect -not too soft, not too chewy.  The teriyaki flavor has the best balance of salty and sweet, and the 1 ounce packages are just right for a snack.
5;It works!;I have used this product for quite some time on and off.  It is easy to use, drink a cup before bed and<br />excellent results in the morning.
5;Excellent Gift to Yourself and Others;This cheesecake is the best.  I sent several orders to all my family all over the country for Thanksgiving and even ordered one for myself.
5;Great stuff!;I love all kinds of rice, and this is my new favorite one. Cooking rice is not rocket science.
4;Greta Kit Great Price;This was a very good kit and my brother -in-law who is a brewmaster give me some tips on how to enhance the flavor by reducing volume and increasing oxidation. I can honestly say that the wine made from this kit tasted way better then some bottles I've spent $10 to $12 on in the store.
4;GREAT STUFF;My dog is allergic to almost every edible food, including treats. I was looking for something that could be a treat that wasn't manufactured and it wouldn't affect him, so I bought them.
4;Simply the best dried Ramyun you can buy;If you like spicy ramyun give this a try, be warned people might think you're cooking up tear gas because it is very..
2;Bitter taste;I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.
5;Love it!;My Dad introduced us to Skinner's years ago. We are now three generations and extended family fans of this cereal.
1;feel like i was dupped.;saw this online as a deal. ordered some thinking I would receive 20 individually packed bars.
3;Not really to my taste;Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice comes in several flavors, and I chose the Apple when placing my order. Being neither a physician nor a connoisseur of fruit juices, I can't say much about the health aspects of this drink, only its taste.
3;It's Fun to Say;If you are here - you probably already know if you want this product or not, so here is a basic review for your reading pleasure.  Shake `n Bake is an old school classic.
2;Weird after taste, sugar substitute;there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.
1;A BIG MESS!;I just got these today and they had almost all leaked. Every box was soaked with juice.
1;love it to death;It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail.
5;Frescobaldi first pressing 2011.;The product is of the highest quality.  I couldn't find one better if I tried.
5;I should move to Sardinia;Didn't really like sardines much till I found these. Now I eat them all the time with salad and walnut oil dressing.
4;good syrups;These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties.
2;Not that great;Something about the flavor just isn't right.  I have purchased and consumed lots of macadamia nuts, including honey roasted and other sweetened varieties.
5;Awesome;Perfect gift for my Mom who's been looking for lime infused oil for over a year.  Tastes great, smells even better.
5;Smoothest coffee I have ever tried!;Looks like I finally found my favorite. I have tried new coffee for last few years looking for something I really liked.
5;Strawberry Fields Forever;If you LOVE strawberry Twizzlers..
5;Lovely tea;What a lovely and light taste.  No bitterness.
5;zoo crackers;A great tasting treat like the old fashion animal crackers. No after taste like many brand made now.
5;Delicious;Delicious, delicious, delicious. Turns a hamburger into a gourmet meal.
5;Yummy coconut oil!;After being refered to this product, I looked everywhere for it.  This is a wonderful thing for the body, both outside and in.
3;Gift idea--olive oil instead of a bottle of wine?;I decided to do something different and give small bottles of olive oil instead of wine.  I bought several different flavors.
5;An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet;"A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed ""Bircherm&uuml"
4;Works fine, looks nice, shipping pricey...;This kit made a nice gingerbread house with everything included.  It's not too hard to make something as nice as what you see on the picture.
1;Fooled after all  these years.;I have been drinking Penta water for more than five years. The only water I would drink and ordered two cases each month.
5;Best cereal EVER!!!;The title pretty much sums it up.  :)  Not too sweet, and just absolutely delicious.
5;taste's great;If you like popcorn, you have to try this. We have an counter top popcorn machine and it work's great.
2;Can we say stale;Wow  thought this would be a Fun mix of candy. Boy was i wrong  90% stale.
5;Nice beans;"I was making the ""Marinated Gigante Bean Salad with Shrimp"" from Gwyneth Paltrow's Cookbook (""My Father's Daughter"") and needed some large, white beans.  I wanted to use the Gigante Beans from Navarro, but they're a bit pricey for a small jar."
4;Great Tasting Kernels;The cotton candy popcorn has a bitter taste at first but overall, it is a great tasting popcorn.  I would buy this again, just in a different flavor.
4;One Spoiled Can Spoils the Batch;Initially my cats loved all three flavors of this Fancy Feast product. Then I got a box that had one badly deformed and bulging can
5;Best White Wine Vinegar!;This spring I purchased a bottle of this vinegar in San Sebastian, Spain.  I was excited to find it online and have just  ordered a couple of bottles.
5;YUMMY PIZZA AT LAST;Gluten Free Pizza has been a real disaster for me.  I have tried many mixes as well as making my own.
5;Amazing I can't cook without it!!;I have been using Johnny's Garlic Spread for years now and the family loves it. Use it on Garlic Bread, add it to tomato sauce, add it to anything you want to spice up.
1;Marshmallows;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1;Reese's minis;The packaging was totally insufficient to mail chocolate candy.  I have ordered candy before, from other retailers and believe me there is a difference.
5;so happy i found this!;This Mac and cheese is great, especially if you cannot have the regular kind. This is the first rice pasta we have tried and it was every bit as good as Annie's regular Mac and cheese.
5;Bentley's Teas Woodgrain Tea Chest;I had purchased a few of the tea chests as Christmas gifts for my neighbors. I thought it was so beautifully made that I purchased another for myself! The wood chest is really pretty and the tea variety inside is great.
4;This is a good tasting coffee!;This coffee is a good, medium tasting coffee. It doesn't have the bitterness and it doesn't leave that awful after taste in your mouth.
4;Very convenient and pretty good;We received this order in perfect condition. I purchased this product for my mother-in-law.
4;Not bad;What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it.
1;snow's clam chowder by bumble bee;i am a long time fan of snow's condensed clam chowder and found that the bumble bee company has obviously changed the original recipe. i was disappionted in this product and hope bumble bee will strive to get this product back to it's name sake's quality.
4;spicy;this can can add a little pick me up to your foods.would reccomend to anyone.
5;Dogs love these!;We normally don't buy expensive treats (tend to stick to dry biscuits), but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a huge hit! Our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these.
5;Convenient form;Stevia is great stuff, and this effervescent tablet form is both convenient and inexpensive.  Each tablet is roughly equivalent to half a teaspoon of sugar.
5;Excellent product;I have been beyond thrilled with these products.  Palouse grows great products, and the flavor is there to prove it.
4;DOG FOOD;The 4 stars ONLY because it did not agree with my toy poodle. She loves this BUT it gives her gas so we had to discontinue it.
1;not good;The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.
5;Good Value Great Color and Flavor;I buy these crystals instead of the teavana german crystals.  I like the color variations equally well and the flavor even better.
4;Healthy food for cats;My two cats loved these Petite Cuisine chicken flavors, and that's where the rubber meets the road in cat food. Happily, the food itself is very healthy and does not contain garbage byproducts.
5;My favorite Organic Tea;Choice Organic Celtic Breakfast Tea is my favorite tea.  It has a nice strong taste but is not bitter and it's organic.
5;Best Instant Hot Cocoa Ever!;This cocoa is rich and flavorful, nicely chocolately! I only wish I could get the flavors in individual boxes. I love most flavors offered, but would love to be able to get my favorites on their own! I like to give packets as Christmas gifts to people I work with done up with a cute package and winter poem.
3;Buyer beware on taste and shipping;I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.
1;MiNi is too small, Terrible Value per OZ. = about 100 Calories @ a High Cost;"Yes, KIND Bars are a fantastic product - while the mark up on the whole foods used to make them can put them out of reach,  =  making raw unsalted almonds and dried fruit from Trader Joe's a more cost effective road to adding more 'Lightly Processed' foods to your plate.<br /><br />Boy, this box feels MiNi when you pick it up, and if Amazon wants to take over the world with the 'Amazon FRESH' wave, for home delivery, then they are going to have to develop more ways for us to ""FEEL"" the products in our hands before we put them in our carts."
5;Money Saving!;This product is awesome if you do a lot of jam like me.  It certainly saves money and creates a very nice, fresh product.
3;It's OK.;This gum is too hard and the flavor is good but doesn't last long. I wanted to try it because it doesn't have any artificial sugar.
5;Excellent price and quality vanilla beans!;I keep these in the freezer to keep them fresh.  I use them for baking and I keep a running amount of vanilla sugar going too.
5;Delicious green tea;The trouble with many mint teas is that the minty flavoring overpowers the underlying tea leaves. Too often, mint is used to make inferior tea taste palatable.
4;Great for picky eaters;My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product.
5;Happy!  Would recommend to anyone!;Item arrived when promised and works as described.  Using for popcorn seasoned with Flavocal - I am now eating popcorn that tastes EXACTLY like movie popcorn.
5;Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!;Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness.
5;Keeps labradoodles busy!;I have two strong chewers and this product keeps them busy for two days. Best long lasting chew I've tried.
5;The Best Canned Cat Food;Wellness food is the best cat food to keep your cat healthy.  My cats love this flavor but any flavor would be a healthy choice for your cat.
5;how did they do that?;just the same great tasting Miracle Whip that I have used for years, but how did they develop this new bottle that empties completely? No kidding..
4;SO GOOD!;i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious.
3;Not bad, but I'll probably stick to my usual.;I love English Breakfast tea, and robust, full-flavored, almost malty without being bitter is how I'd describe the ideal blend.  Sadly, while the Higgins & Burke blend isn't the worst, I wouldn't say it's ideal.
5;Paleo Pup;This dog food is an amazing quality and with no grain! We eat a paleo diet in our house and so does our dogs. They have much more productive digestion and get full nutrients without added filler.
1;Do not buy this product!;I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.
2;Offensive gas producer!!!;I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer.
5;Great and oddly bacon-y;Out of the many varieties of McDougall's that I've tried, I think I like this one the most for everyday eating. It has a ton of substance to it (16g of protein, 40% DV of dietary fiber) while keeping the calories low, and it tastes great.
4;A no brainer meal for picky eaters.;This was a very good, easy and tasty meal for my fussy eaters and all done in one pan, which is important when you don't have much time on your hand. Directions were easy to follow and came out nicely.
4;This little tree is still alive.;I bought it thinking we would kill it. Nope it has been a couple months and it has not even lost a leaf.
3;BPA in the lid?;I like their variety package, but also heard that there is BPA in the lid. I will switch to other BPA free products.
4;Rich Cappuccino without the Calories;Caf&eacute
1;no customer service;The product was ok. I like that it has no dairy, as I was unable to find any that my son, who has a dairy allergy, could have.
5;Wonderful cookies -----;When Mother's Cookies was bought out I was devastated.  So many of their cookies are wonderful.
3;Trying this product for the first time;I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.
5;Tasty and Good for You!;This is the perfect morning perk me up.  The tea brews nicely and has just a hint of jasmine flavors (not overpowering at all).
5;Jasmine;I love this tea. I used to buy loose jasmine green tea but this bagged variety is much more economical and tastes almost as good.
5;My Cats Just Love This;My Cats truly love Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Variety Pack. They love the variety.
5;Guilt-free treats;Both dogs love these - my anything-is-delicious-Lab and my picky no-one-knows-what-he-is little mutt. The Lab gets a whole heart at a time, the lil one gets half a heart at a time.
5;Be aware that the photo is NOT what you will get;I finally received the color that I ordered - there was a mixup on the seller's end, but they did<br />get right on it and send out the right color.  I have not used it yet - I bought it for special cupcakes<br />for an event in a few days.
1;disappointed;These little beans are Way Way too salty for a snack. They worked in a soup with alot of water.
4;yummy;I was afraid this might be too strong for hubby's coffee (I use stevia myself), but he likes it.<br /><br />We made chocolate chip cookies using entirely this sugar for both white and brown sugars.
5;Old Mother Hubbard treats;I can't say how good it is because I never tried them myself, but both of my dogs love it! It's one of the few ways I can get them to come on back home when they are out in the back yard. I just yell that I have their chicken treats and they come running.
5;My little girl's FAVE flavor of TOT HappySqueezes;I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.
5;Excellent bonito soup stock;Most chefs would probably prefer to make their own soup stock. However,if you're in a pinch an instant soup stock can be a life saver.
1;Chalky taste;This xylitol in packets is very chalky in taste.  I hate it!  So far, I have bought Now, Epic and Natrazyle xylitol, and the Now has been the only one not worth buying again.
3;Good candy...;I like these candy blocks. As it's stated in other reviews, the picture is misleading, there are no purple or white blocks.
5;The ONLY product that helps my cat with hairballs;My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system - he never spits them up.
1;Try a sample first;Just like other reviewers, my cat also went on a hunger strike rather than eat this food. I DID gradually switch foods and yet when only the Wellness food was left, he would refuse to eat it.
3;Good steaks, Delivery was a little delayed though..;Good steaks, Delivery was a little delayed though..
5;Awesome!;Great taste..
3;Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish;"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated""."
1;Tastes like awful;If awful had a taste, this would be it.  Truly horrible.
5;Buy At Your Own Risk;
5;My Go To coffee!;I have been tasting beans for a while looking for an everyday coffee.  This is a great midway coffee.
4;Does Double Duty;It seems, having a look at other Voices' reviews, that I'm not alone in discovering that Quaker Oatmeal Squares make an excellent snack all on their own (and in fact, with the exception of one bowl with milk, this is how I consumed my box within a very few days). However, that's not to say that they're not good with milk.
5;A taste of home;What can I say?  I grew up in Texas and drank this all my life.  The flavor is indescribably unique and refreshing.
5;THIS COFFEE IS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!;Blueberry coffee..
4;Irish Breakfast Tea;Taylor's of Harrogate Irish Tea is very good, great flavor.  My only complaint and surprise is the individual packaging.
5;My favorite black tea;I have a family member currently living in Herrogate, England. He sent me some of this tea and I was immediately in love! I have been drinking tea my entire life and consider myself fairly schooled on teas.
3;Cider House Carmel Appl;Hey Tara Lee, was excited that someone had a review for the Cider House Carmel Apple Cider mix in the nifty packets. Hope by know that you've tried it and can let us know what you think.
5;great.not dangerous;how can u say its not safe??????its great because they are hard,my son chews on them,they melt,yeah messy but..
5;Nestles Fat Free Hot Chocolate;It is great..
1;BUYER BEWARE;This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix.
5;No carbs, loving my Ketostix!;I can tell such a difference in the performance of a low carb diet when using this product instead of powdered packet sweeteners!  Using Ketostix, I get a much faster, darker purple result, and return to purple quicker after deviating from low carb, when I used these drops instead of blue or pink packets.  I love my coffee and tea to be sweeeet, and several packets of sweeteners add several carbs per cup/glass.
5;My best beauty secret!;I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, & this is really gentle & soothing.
5;Our Cats Love It!;We have three cats, and they all love Petite Cuisane - every flavor. Every time we empty a can into their feeding tray, the cats fight like mad to get their chops on the tasty meal.
5;Great coffee, less waste in packaging;This coffee is a good selection if you like a dark, full-bodied brew to chase the fog, and dislike the waste inherent with the convenience of a Keurig K-cup brewer. Works great, less material waste and less packaging waste.
5;awsome;no complaints, awsome, cheap, can not find it for better price anywhere else. highly recommended, its like hazelnut, work well with k cup machine.
5;Good garlic kick!;Oh! So Garlic! will offer a well rounded garlic kick to whatever you are cooking. One of our favorite ways to use this seasoning is to add a good shake of Oh! So Garlic! to 2 tablespoons light butter.
4;Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue;****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.
4;you won't miss the salt;"I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order ""with added salt."
5;My kitten loves these!;These are the only treats I feed my 4 month old kitten. I usually give him 3 treats, 3 times a day.
5;HAPPY HIPS MAKES A HAPPY HEALTHY HUSKY!;What a wonder healthy treat we have discovered! I never would have imagined that Teecos Niceah Misty Blue would eat bananas!!! Happy Hips also aids us in our training. Niceah is a certified AKC registered Pet Therapy Dog and our patients have enjoyed giving Niceah her Happy Hips Chicken and Banana Treats during our visits.
3;1 of 5 Kups Breaks;Great rich flavor. Long time user but a 25%<br />breakage rate-never had cups do this before.
3;Great for new users;
1;SEVERE VOMITING;I have two dogs and both react very badly to these.  The two times my Labrador got one she vomited severely both times.
5;Best mints out there;I discovered these while in Costa Rica, bought them at a local store when my mouth was dry. Couldn't find them in the stores anywhere here, not sure why, so now I buy them in bulk on Amazon so I always have a supply.
2;This product is vastly over rated.;The idea behind buying this is to have a natural pick-me-up in the morning.  The problem is they have doses of things in it that are too high.
1;YUCH!;Impressed,as always,with Amazon's expedient delivery. I perused customer reviews before ordering and felt comfortable with my choice (I was going to get the Emeril Bourbon Street blend , which I love) as reviewers gave this a great rating.
4;Really salty, but good.;The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.
5;Tasty, a nice quick meal option;My partner and I both work from home, and so we often need quick-fix meals for lunch in the middle of the day. So we gave these a try, and were quite pleased! The pasta softened up very well, and the sauce heated up with no problems at all.
5;Love &lt;
5;Replaced Starbucks as my all time favorite!;When I got my Keurig, I couldn't wait to get my favorite Starbucks coffee in K Cups. When I saw this, I liked the design of the cup and the price is much better too.
5;Entire family LOVES this ketchup;Ketchup isn't something I had given much thought to, in the past.  The sad truth is, we had run out of ketchup in the dead of winter and I could get it from Amazon faster than I was going to get to the store.
5;Nice packaging, great teas!;I got this set when it was offered as the goldbox deal. I absolutely love it.
5;My cat's favorite dry food;I have a very picky older cat. She is probably extra picky because she's old and has trouble digesting some cat foods.
5;Mmmm-mmm!;When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception.
2;Too hot for me.;My title for this review says it all.  I like the Stonewall's Jerquee products, but this flavor is just too hot for my mouth.
5;A great, xylitol-sweetened snack!;I heard about this product through the author of the Body Ecology diet, Donna Gates. I ordered all 3 flavors immediately and quickly discovered my family likes the Berry flavor best.
3;Frustrated;Why does amazon not put the stats of the product on their page? It's a shame that you have to navigate away from the site to find out exactly how much Fiber, Protein, Sodium, Potassium..
2;Weak Stuff;The Melitta Creme Brulee Coffee is bland and flavorless, despite its flavored nature.<br />Whether drinking it black or with a bit of creamer, I was hard-pressed to recognize<br />this product as coffee at all.
5;Perfect 100 cal Packs!;I LOVE salt and vinegar flavors.  Always ordered the chips when picking up lunch, but now I know these are waiting for me at home.
5;Worms!;Nine pounds of gummy worms is a lot.  The worms were packaged to me in two non-resealable unlabeled bags.
5;Wow!;This company is great, they shipped super fast and the vanilla beans were plump, fragrant, and tasty. I've always seen recipes that just casually called for a vanilla bean or two and just looked at them longingly, since in the store just one will set you back seven or more bucks.
5;Best of Three;The Sumatra coffee is my favorite of the EkoJava blends [I've tried French Roast and Honduras House]. It has a nice bold flavor and the packet size is great for the re-usable k-cups [solofill or my k-cup type].
5;Tastes good in coffee;This is really good in coffee.  I bought several flavors from the Capella company, and this is my favorite so far.
5;Great liver treats-extra benefits for white dogs;These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them.
5;My Jimmies Remain Unrustled;It also taste like crunchy corn pops and it's really good. It has a very calming effect on my Jimmies.
3;whahappened?;I've been buying these for years and my dog loves them. They make a great reward treat and they're easy to carry .
5;My FAVORITE Coffee!;I am so excited to discover that I can get my coffee on Amazon -delivered for free using my Prime account. I love the medium blend of Community Coffee, but for some reason my local grocery store stopped carrying this blend.
4;Mmmm mmm good;If you have been out to Philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal. They are organic and made of honey.
5;Proof that Gluten Free can be GOOD!;"Living gluten-free for several years now, it's been a while since I had any ""real"" chocolate chip cookies.  But, I don't remember them being even close to as good as what comes from this mix."
1;not fresh..  bad taste;Taste not the original one.<br /><br />Flakes werent crispy.
5;Why such a dramatic price increase?;I order these quite allot and they last me for a few months.  My last order was March 4, 2010.
5;YUM!;"For someone who is allergic to corn, soy and wheat the Original Pop Chips are a must have for the pantry. I can finally have nachos! I think they taste much better than the traditional ""chips""."
5;Best baby food maker ever;"I love this little machine.  I worked as a professional nanny for years before having my own baby and I made a lot of baby food during that time (lucky kids :)  This machine makes home made baby food a cinch!<br /><br />Here is what I love:<br /><br />Smaller batches - unless you are living your own version of ""baby boom"" you just don't need to make gallons of apple sauce<br /><br />Fast!  I can have baby food in about 10 minutes, so if I run out, it just takes a few minutes to make something fresh<br /><br />Great puree - really smooth and creamy, or as chunky as you wish<br /><br />it's small - not a space hog in my cramped kitchen<br /><br />Looks cute - so I don't having it out all the time<br /><br />If you are leaning towards getting the device, or registering one for your baby shower - DO IT!  you will love it, promise."
5;Safe product with no chemicals;I have bought Organix dog food and these treats for several years because they have no chemicals.  My dogs love them.
5;A kick in 20 grams;Very delicious, sweet enough for sugar lovers with enough caffeine to keep you awake. Taking these packets for travel abroad since they are so inexpensive yet effective.
4;Great product;We can no longer find this product in the store. It is nice to still be able to get it.
2;no lime flavor I could find;This is just green sweetener.  While there's nothing wrong with that, I was hoping for something with a strong lime flavor.
2;Not K-cups;These are not K-cups which is a shame because there are no Lavazza K-cup option.  I got a refund even though they wouldn't take it back as it is food.
5;Great pricing;I use this product exclusively for my toy breed dogs.  My dogs all do very well on the product.
1;Don't buy this! bad bad new recipe!!!;Lindt changed the recipe and it's completely blend, sweeter and leaves a greasy texture in your mouth when it melts. What are these people thinking? That their customers are dumb or what??? I'm so disappointed.
5;Good buy! Good taste!;I bought this coffee for my honey. He has his own ideas about how coffee should taste and this one has been satisfactory.
4;A nice tea;I like rooibos tea a lot and this tea is no exception. It's fragrant and smooth.
5;Great Hot Sour Soup Mix;I bought Mishima Hot sour soup mix from Walmart. It set in the cabinet for a while until I finally tried the mix.
3;Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee;This review is for Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). The packaging for this shipment was appropriate, as was the actual bag containing the ground coffee, which included a way for re-sealing to maintain freshness.
3;Meh;They weren't awful but, as another reviewer said, I wouldn't buy them again. The heat was actually pretty good which I don't find a lot in things that are supposed to be hot.
5;Highly Recommend this Dog Food;I don't usually review items, but I am highly impressed with this dog food.  After much research, I decided to go with Blue Buffalo based on very favorable reviews of the ingredient list.
5;Ki Almond Plus Cranberry and Almond Bars;"I think this bar is exceptional because it contains such large pieces of nuts, even whole almonds, and cranberries.<br />This is a great ""take along"" snack as long as it is kept somewhat cool."
5;Cincinnati-style chili -- close to the real deal;For those of us who long for Cincinnati-style chili but who do not live close to a chili parlor that serves it, these cans make a darn good substitute. Be warned though, that is not in any way a southwestern chili! It was created by Greek cooks (who knows why), and the sauce is thin and flavored rather like the meat sauce you might find in some Moussaka recipes.
5;My dog loves these healthy treats!;My dog has many food allergies, so these treats that are free of wheat, egg, and dairy are great for him.  Equally important, the treats are made in the USA, so there's no worry about China trying to poison our pet.
3;SOY??? WHY?;Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and..
5;Best Water;Does it make me smarter? Nope. Does it taste fantastic ice cold? Yup.
1;STALE;i have previously tried these from Whole Foods so i knew exactly what to expect.  however, when i opened the first bag, they were STALE, which made them taste bland and disgusting.
3;Ok snack, but I won't buy again;These pecans have a salty sweet glaze and are very rich. I usually have a hard time stopping when it comes to praline pecans, but I haven't felt compelled to open up a second bag in the same setting.
5;A great way to drink water;I have been using this product for over a year now.  It is a great way to get the recommended amount of water down each day and it tastes good.
4;Warmed up it tastes great;This has a really good apple flavor and when it's warm, it looses that medicinal after taste.  I use it in place of the pancake syrup for a different taste.
2;Not minced, this is ground beef;Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.
5;Just like vanilla oreos;These cookie and the chocolate version are the best gluten free substitutes for Oreo cookies on the market. Filling very creamy and cookie is nice and light.
5;So good and good for you!!;This is my new favorite cereal! What makes it so good? Well I'll tell you! First, the flakes are very crispy and they hold up in milk. The blueberry clusters are a great addition with the blueberry having just the right amount of flavor.
5;Great snacks;I first found this snack in an airport. The price was outrageous, but the taste was great.
3;Sherry Vinegar Bust;I love sherry vinegar but this product was very harsh and rough tasting. Not at all what I want in a sherry vinegar.
2;Crushed box;Received the producy in a crushed box. I ended up finding it less expensive locally on sale.
2;Crumbs;These crackers taste great and we like that they are organic. However, the texture is too soft to make it through shipping.
5;yummy;I was buying these everyday for almost $2..
5;Great Coffee, Great Price;Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase.
5;Great tea!;Great tea to boost your immune system, it also works as stress reliever, the tulsi or holy basil is native to India. This herb improves resistance to stress and has a normalizing influence on blood pressure and blood sugar imbalances.
5;DOGS LOVE THESE;Bought these after speaking with a Blue Buffalo rep inside a store.  The ingredient list is amazingly good, the product is MADE IN AMERICA, and my dogs go nuts for them.
5;The BEST! Kettle Baked Cheddar Chips;My husband and I went to Kauai  in Feb. of this year and we tried these chips for the first time.
5;Great Way to Make What You Want;I bought these for a couple reasons.  First to have the option to use flavored coffees that I have been using for years
5;We love the garlic flavor!;My kids love these chips. We've tried all the flavors (sea salt, salt and pepper, rosemary) and find these to be the most enjoyable.
4;Lose the acid without losing taste.;I used about 2oz of this ground coffee in my Bialetti espresso pot to make a 12oz cup of strong, good tasting coffee. It certainly does not lose anything from the removal of acid
5;Why so expensive?;I also love this seasoning and have been using for years.  However, I think that this vendor is over-charging in a major way.
4;Wonderful coffee;You should get this in any Indian grocery..
5;one of the best K-cup coffees out there;Great coffee and one of the best k-cup coffees I have tried..
5;A little more than a snack;My Amazon shipment of Lowrey's beef jerky came lightning fast. Anyway, what I like about Lowrey's is that it is tasty and satisfying without having to give my jawbone a workout.
1;Earl Grey should not contain lavender;The quality of the tea in this blend is probably fine.  However, the lavender is so overbearing that one can taste nothing else.
5;Great for canned soup !!!!;This soup is so good. Good for low calorie lunch.
5;Great product;If you are looking for a great quality all natural royal jelly in a honey base product..
2;Must have gotten a bad batch :(;I must have gotten a bad batch, Both the roast and the cup quality were poor.<br />2/10 cups so far have failed and dumped grounds into my cup.
1;Bags do not compost even in a year;I have a very active compost bin, complete with red wriggler worms.  I bought a set of these bags, some kitchen size, some leaf size, and dog waste size.
5;Nutiva Coconut Oil;I got this because I had read on another website that this product was great for using in place of butter and for skin care. Well, I don't like using it in place of butter.
5;Coffee like no other;"Since we moved from Alaska, we have not been able to find coffee that meets the standard of Ravens Brew - Deadman packs a punch and leaves you wanting more. We have a stash we take on vacation with us to keep our ""good"" coffee within reach."
5;How to hook a cat;I gave these a try with finicky, picky Emmy, only because everything else--Pounce, Friskies, the gourmet little cans--had pretty much failed. (I have no idea what she lives on, because she's determined to show me she's above eating anything I offer her.
4;Plastic container??;A little disappointed that this quality product came in a cheap, plastic container. Do the words leaching, BPA, wasteland, etc.
5;One of my favorites;I love this flavor.  I like trying different coffee flavors and this is ranked one of my fav's.
4;Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats;****<br /><br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health.
5;Great Skippy Reduced Fat Peanut Butter;This is the best reduced fat creamy peanut butter I've tasted. My whole family loves it.
5;So far, so good!;My dog has eaten this food for 19 days. So far he has not gotten an ear infection, but still shows redness on his paws.
5;Love the flavored grind...;While I think this coffee could be a bit more finely ground for my taste, I also think that it has great character and flavor.  The vanilla, while noticable, does not overwhelm the coffee.
1;Broke my dog's tooth! Buyer beware! Sharp edges, too.;If you look at my reviews, you will see that I love buying treats for my doggies and recommend many great treats. However, these were way too hard and sharp! I was a bit worried when I gave them to my doggies, and it turned out that I was right to be worried, because my terrier mix broke a tooth which needs to be extracted now.
5;Lavazza Crema e Gusto Coffee;Lavazza crema e gusto is the best coffee. When you sip it, you can really tell that it has the true flavor of a good coffee.
4;Texture & Taste;I thought this product had great taste and texture. It is exactly what I expected from a supplement bar.
3;Coffee taste alright;This is my first shipment for this coffee.  I'm on a subscription basis.
5;Really good everyday coffee;Tried this coffee and think it's a really good flavor.  Reordered the pack of the variety coffees and all of my guest say they really like it.
1;Not quite was depicted;For starters, it comes in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark glass in the picture.  Then there's the ingredient list:<br /><br />Water, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, natural and artificial flavors, Phosphoric Acid.
5;Great flavor and texture;A big fan of kettle-cooked chips since I was a kid, I tend to go around buying any and all brands and flavors I can find.  As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.
5;best salad dressing ever;This is the best salad dressing ever with tons of flavor and not that many fat calories.  it's reasonable if you are on a diet or watching your fat/calories.
5;Very tasty - maybe a little too rich if making with milk;I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.
5;Hangover CURE;This handy dandy drink-a-doo is the hangover CURE. I figured this out when I purchased this product at a gas station on the way to a weekend get away.
5;CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS STUFF!;Have used TORANI syrup for at least 30 years, probably more - wouldn't be without it!  Baking, cooking, drinks, coffee . .
5;Dogs love them!;My dogs can not wait to get this treat everyday.  I think the glucosamine helps my older dog's joints.
5;Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants;Delicious bar! I love it.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.
5;excellent caffeine free chai tea;Teavana's teas are always delicious - this is no exception. It is a nice chai tea (not too strong) that is caffeine free - there are few caffeine free teas that are also chai teas, and this one is excellent.
4;Delicious falafel mix!;We love the OrGran products. They are good quality.
1;$40.00?;I placed an order for this on 4/18/2011, and it was $28.59.
3;Seaweed snacks, Wasabi flavor;"Be aware that these are the type of thing you probably either really like or really don't like, and if you don't care for sushi you probably won't like these. Yes, that sounds like a ""Duh"" statement, but they really are sort of fishy."
5;Can't decide......;I spent over an hour trying to decide which of these GF Bakery On Main Granola mixes to order next.  I tried the Apple Raisin Walnut, and LOVED it.
4;Delicious;I enjoy Coconut Manna very much.  I  add it to my oatmeal instead of sugar or maple syrup or have a teaspoon of it plain and it satisfies my sweet tooth without any sugar.
5;Nice alternative to peanut butter;I still like the taste peanut butter better, but Barney almond butter is a nice alternative that is growing on me. Great on Saltines or Ritz crackers or on apple slices.
2;...;While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee.
3;Quite pleased with the transaction and the product;Fast shipping, quality product in durable bag with ziplock. Good quantity and cheap.
5;good light coffee flavor;If you like a light-flavored coffee, you will probably go for this one for convenience as well as flavor.<br /><br />It is in coffee bags (like tea bags) so you never need to make more than one cup at a time.
5;I use this tea for menstral cramps;I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.
5;What a melon! (tea);"There are few things in this world that scream ""summer"" to me like watermelon. Unfortunately, they're one of those rare treats as my father is allergic to it, so I only had it at other people's parties when growing up."
5;KCUPS COFFEE;THE DONUT HOUSE LIGHT ROAST COFFEE IS VERY GOOD.  IT WORKS WELL WITH THE KREIG COFFEE MAKER, AND THE COFFEE HAS VERY GOOD FLAVOR.
5;Delicious!;This soda is great for those dieting, but wanting a rich, chocolatey taste. Very yummy! I remember this from years ago and so happy to have found it.
5;Dachshunds love this toy;Our Miniature Dachshunds love this toy. It is a favorite to grab as they run by with the other dogs chasing them, play tug of war with, or just give it a good shake.
1;Manuka Honey;I must have had too high of expectations. If it wasn't for the laxative effects I would have sworn I was taking a placebo.
2;Office Grade Coffee;I am a fairly big coffee drinker that brews my own pot of coffee pretty much every morning and then after lunch will buy a cup at a either SB, Pete's, or if I am lucky enough to be around a Blue Bottle seller.  I admit that in a pinch, I will drink some of the sludge we have in the office (caffeine addiction is sad thing).
5;Fabulous taste!;"I made ""from scratch"" Almond cupcakes from a recipe in a well known cupcake book (Hello Cupcake) and inadvertently used twice as much almond paste as the recipe called for. I frosted them with almond frosting and topped them with coconut."
5;Good price, great taste;Love Stash Chai Spice.  I think it is the best tasting version out there.
3;Fresh Apple it Isn't;The CytoSport energy drink is a helpful sports supplement. It does give a noticeable boost to help power through intense hour long cardio classes such as Spinning, Cardio Kickboxing and Zumba.
5;way better than the cherry ones;these are so much better than the cherry flavor. I first bought the cherry ones, and they tasted GROSS! I bought these, and these actually taste like apple and not a nasty tasting cough drop.
4;the un-wimpy chocolate;If you're not used to dark chocolate, Ghirardelli 72% takes a while to get used to because it's flavor is stronger than most others in the 70-72% range. I used to like Lindt 70% (before they changed the recipe), but Ghirardelli's flavor is more unadulterated and stronger, with a bitterness and 'bite' that I like.
5;Miracle product;I hate when people throw around the words Miracle Product about anything.  It sounds so douchey.
5;More expensive than grocery store but not too bad;I like to have shelf stable whole milk in the pantry for cooking. I tried drinking it but it gave me indigestion, however for cooking it's great.
5;Smoked Perfection!;Sent this to my parents last Christmas (entering their 80s) and they absolutely loved the taste and portions.  Dove into a portion and froze the rest in the handy clear packs.
5;All time favorite;This is my go to coffee when I need to pick a favorite.  Just a hint of cinnamon but enough to give it a good flavor.
4;Curried Lentil Soup;This order of soup arrived in good condition and on time. It is a delicious soup and makes a hearty meal.
4;it works;i bought this product because of a recommendation and the reviews from amazon. It helps me regulate my weight but has not noticeably helped with my pain from muscle spasms and tight ligaments.
3;Great candy but...;I've been a subscribe and save purchaser of this Nerds item for almost a year and this last batch is just awful, sour and bitter. Not sure if it is spoiled/old or what, but I'm probably going to end up tossing out most of it.
5;fresh, fragrant and so much better than what you find at the grocery store.;I ordered several whole seed spices and was very pleased with their freshness. Grinding just what you need only takes a minute and the payoff is worth the effort.
4;Excellent coffee for the price;I'm a casual coffee drinker who is more likely to like McDonalds or Duncan Donuts coffee than Starbucks, which I find too burnt. I also like sugar and milk so I'm not obsessing over subtleties of flavor.
5;Good stuff;This is a great product..
5;Excellant health benefits;I just got into drinking Matcha and have been fascinated by it. This is an excellant product for a reasonable price.
5;Great tasting coffee;Best tasting Hazelnut coffee I have found in a k-cup.  Wish it was sold in an 80 pack, instead of 50.
5;Hard to Find Item;This item became hard to find in my local supermarket so I decided to search Amazon and found it easly there.  I sent some to my Grandaughter, in Florida,  who also was not able to find it in her local store.
5;The Good Oil;I have been using this oil for two years and refuse to run out of it.  I like the overall well being that I feel when using it daily.
5;Great Oil but.......;Love this oil. Use for everything from cooking to cosmetic use.
5;gophers' bane;If you have pocket gopher problem, get this trap.  Set it up correctly and you will catch your enemy.
5;It's a sweet thing.;Wanting to cut back on sugar my family tested practically every artificial sweetner on the shelf and decided to go with Sugar Twin. We like it because it is sweet without a bitter after-taste and because it is inexpensive ( at least though Amazon ).
4;Gone in Two Days;I bought this for my husband and he must have liked it, because he ate the whole bag in two days. Shipping rates were really high.
5;Salt and Vinegar addict;I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.
5;Never get enough!;I guess when you go to bed dreaming about your next cup of coffee that means you really love it. That describes my relationship with Maxwell House International Coffee's Cafe Vienna.
5;awesome tasting cookies;We tasted these cookies in Florida, came home and ordered a case of them, they are the best tasting, buttery crispy like waffles. but they are cookies, very thin and crispy.
1;Diarrhea;Stopped giving this product to my 9 yr old lab mix because she developed really bad diarrhea. Now I have her on probiotics and scheduled a vet appointment.
5;OUTSTANDING! A must have for raman or noodle fan!;I get these at Walmart (in the Asian food section) for .49 cents each.
5;Great Taste;This popcorn tastes great.<br />Its so easy, just cut off the top and pour in the contents.
5;Easy way to get dog to take medications.;Great price on Pill Pockets.  Our one dog does not like cheese or peanut butter (imagine that!).
5;Wabash popcorn oil;We have try other kinds but they cant  beat Wabash Vally Farms real theater popcorn popping oil ..
5;How we keep the cost down on this great product;"I would echo what many others have said about the Greenies being heaven-sent. Our two chihuahuas get a mix of bitter-tasting herbs/supplements, and the Pill Pockets have proven to be the easist, most effective (and most fun!) way to get them to take their daily dose (powders/tinctures which I mix up with a little coconut oil, divide into pea-sized ""pills"" and freeze)."
1;"A Very ""Vanilla"" Sampler Pack";The selection of K-Cups was not as pictured.  Out of 34 cups, I received 13 vanilla and 6 hazelnut.
3;not the best, certainly not the worst;this is as close an item as i can find to the can in front of me..
5;Himalayan Pink salt;Great product.  I think this has been about the best salt for the value that I have purchases lately.
5;Yummm Sweet Potatoes;My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. Great job ELLAS I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself.
5;Great taste and low glycemic impact;Greens Plus Chocolate Energy Bars taste great, are filling, and don't bounce your blood sugar.  No shakes and no being hungry in an hour.
5;So much lavendar!;The lavendar is so fragrant, I could smell it on my front step when it arrived. There was a bonus sample of rose buds included with the shipment as well as information and recipies for the lavendar.
1;Not impressed.;Old, dry beans.  I was not impressed.
5;If you love Strong Coffee, this is your Choice;I'm the type of guy that fills the filter to the rim in order to get as strong coffee as I possibly can.  Jet Fuel is very close to drinking Expresso in flavor, highly recommend it.
4;Dog Approved...Owner;My dog loves these treats!  I like to split them into 4 pieces to maximize my dog's love.  She'll do anything for these treats.
1;Broken cookies.;We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition.
1;Not good;I picked this up at my local Rite Aid. It was only a dollar for an 8pk, so I decided to try them.
5;The best tasting almonds!;I love these almonds and have a hard time finding them where I live. I was so happy to see them on Amazon.
5;great for training;The dogs love them! Even the picky eater obeyed commands to get one. Small enough that it doesnt fill them up, but large enough to be worth the effort.
5;Doggies love this food-even finicky dogs;I have two dogs.  One of them, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has a very sensitive stomach and Newman's food is the only food that agrees with him.
4;Mango Madness;This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.
5;A Tried And True Favorite That Stands The Test Of Time;The 25 cent slim jim that has been around for what seems like forever is just as good as ever.  Great bang for your buck.
3;Tastes Better Than Most Energy Drinks;Most energy drinks don't live up to the buzz.  They taste awful and the energy boost never<br />equals the hype.
5;Love this salt!;I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.
5;wish I'd started using it 5 years ago;I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.
3;Expected More...;I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free..
3;it's organic;I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor.
5;I don't actually like normal coffee, but I love this!;As a very health oriented person I've never really been very interested in normal coffee, but have at various times dabbled in different coffee alternatives.<br /><br />Although many of the other coffee alternatives aren't bad, I can't really say that I was all that interested in them.
4;Yummy Taste of Sunshine;This cake was ordered for my husband's birthday, and despite warnings to order early and snowstorms in the northeast where we live, it arrived in ample time..
5;Best tasting 5 Hour Energy drink yet!;I consider myself a connoisseur of the energy drink world, and by far the 5-Hour products have been the best of the best.  For various medical reasons, I can't drink coffee or tea because of irritants/acids that naturally occur in them.
5;Delicious!;I find this Gluten Free pasta to be the best out there. This one you do not want to overcook.
4;Boston MA;Arrived in a day - ahead of expected arrival day.  Strong ginger taste.
5;extra good spices;My spices arrived a lot sooner than I expected. Very neatly packaged with enough insulation so nothing would get broken.
3;Doggies don't like! :-(;I bought this and a case of the canned to try out on my aged Border collie and young Toller-because my sister in law uses it for her Lab pup and the dog looks great-the best coat I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it was a bust for us, because neither of the dogs will eat it.
5;Great for picky sensitive dogs;I have two English bull terrier with bad allergies. One of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that I bought.
5;Favorite;This is probably my favorite tea, it tastes so fresh and fruity. My kids love it too and it's very good iced and warm.
5;Great Product - Great Value;My cats REALLY enjoy Kitty Kaviar sprinkled on the wet food! It is hard to find at the pet stores. This was a really good price.
4;Drinking water has never been this enjoyable and satisfying;I am now a huge fan of water enhancers. The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch certainly adds delight to this never ending ritual which is so vital to life.
5;Eden Organic Dried Wild Blueberries;These dried blueberries are absolutely the most delicious by far that I have ever tried before and I have tried several different brands. I choose Eden brand because they are sweetened with apple juice rather than cane sugar.
2;Very Small;Opened the box and could not believe how small this was. The picture is very deceiving.
1;These are gross;I only ate 2 bites of one of the bowls and gave the rest to coworkers because they literally taste like carpet. Stick to the Nong Shim brand, I liked those 100 times better.
5;Moo Bully Sticks;Excellent product!  I've brought home different bully sticks and these are by far the best.  They do not smell, they do not stain and my dog loves them!  Seller was excellent and shipped quick.
5;One of my favorites;This is a wonderful cup of coffee no matter what time of day you drink it.<br />It is so smooth, and not bitter.
5;The best coffee ever!!!;I am a coffee drinker..
5;Yogi tea never disappoints me;I've tried several Yogi tea flavors and this has to be one of my favorites. When you drink Yogi tea, you know the taste is going to be out of ordinary.
5;Great tasting Senseo Dark Roast Coffee;We love the great taste of this coffee. We use one pod to make 2 cups.
5;Excellent Taste!;The cookies have an excellent taste and texture. I took them to a friend's house and they had no idea the were sugar free until I told them.
5;Beyond Delicious;Gives sauces, stews, soups, etc. intense flavor of FRESH COCONUT.
5;Very good;These are very addicting! They have a great dill pickle flavor and are not too salty. I highly recommend them if you enjoy sunflower seeds and love dill pickles.
5;Bought This for My Son at College;This is so handy if you lead a busy life. I bought this for my son at college.
3;Dented Cans;Love the mushrooms but half the cans arrived badly dented.  Wish they could fix this issue.
5;A richer roast than either Bustelo or Pil&oacute;
5;Too Good!;It's true, you do get hooked. I bought this being curious, and found that it's freaking delicious! It's perfect for those mornings on the run, or those days you just feel lazy and don't want to mess with the coffee maker or walk to the local coffee shop.
4;"A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either ""Blazin'"" or ""Buffalo Wing.""";I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting.
1;Awful purchase - not as described or pictured - DO NOT BUY;This assortment was AWFUL.  I received 10 of the same flavor of holiday flavors (I ordered after the holidays) as well of 5-6 of other flavors.
3;Not bad.;These tartlet cookies are cute. However, they're really hard, so I can't really break them into smaller pieces for our Pekingese.
5;Love!;I'm not a big coffee drinker as I hate the bitterness.  These k-cups changed the way I think of coffee completely.
1;"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips""";These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.
1;Wow, I cant believe how expensive a bag of corn is!;No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this.
1;Dog snout doesnt fit!!;Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.
1;Have to agree this is not cranberry juice;"Reading the label it says this is ""27% cranberry juice"" and a bunch of other fairly innocuous stuff, but it is not real cranberry juice.  Yuck."
5;Vegan dish served in Buddhist monasteries;The food label Companion sells a line of vegan foods made of wheat gluten and tofu, many with vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, baby corns etc., seasoned with soy and/or chili sauce.
3;Not Bad, Not Great;The single serve packaging is convenient, although there does seem to be just a bit too much coffee in each pack (as other reviews have noted).  The coffee itself is not bad.
5;Tastes great and great for you!;First off let me say that I have been eating vegetarian and soy made meals, burgers, and other concoctions for nearly half my life, from the really great tasting to the not so great tasting. So when I stumbled on this burger mix in my local bulk foods section I jumped on the chance to taste this stuff and am VERY happy I did.
4;"These are worth an ""8 ears up"" rating, almost.";All four of my dogs, ranging in size from 30 lbs to 85 lbs absolutely love these.  As soon as they hear the crinkly sound of the package they come, sit, and intently watch me with all their ears up and alert (the 8 ears up rating) until they get their chews and then go off to enjoy them.
5;Redbull works;Redbull energy drink sugarfree rocks. I would like to thanks Amazon for sale it cheap.
3;Low-cal lunch needs something more;I bought these as a quick, low calorie (around 320 for the can) lunch for work.  The soup isn't bad tasting
2;"Not sure why this is called ""Turtle"" flavor...";Sooo bland.  Was excited to try this but sadly was disappointed.
4;Quite Yummy!;These are quite yummy!  They don't quite rank up there with a coffee that you get at a coffee house..
5;ldh;Purchased the tea bags for bridal shower favors.  I stuck on a customized sticker on the tea bags, and everyone loved it.
5;Not What I Would Expect From Son Kite.;I was first introduced to Son Kite back in 2000. I was going through my psycho trance phase and decided to give this group a go after a native of Sweden recommended the duo.
5;Mild and Very Edible;If you hate fishy tasting fish like I do, but want to try sardines for the health benefits, try these. I had tried but given up on sardines before due to the heavy, fishy taste.
1;Pass on this one.;I tried this for the price. I thought the different style cup was why it was less expensive.
1;Yikes, what a rip-off;Twelve six-ounce packages equals 72 ounces, or 4.5 lbs.
5;Purrfectly great!!!;The Purrfectly Fish and Chicken food line is great - I have a very finicky cat who has to eat because of health problems, so letting him go until he's hungry enough doesn't work. On top of that, he has a real preference for dry kibble, which he can't have anymore.
5;Absolutely Delicious;ORGANIC!<br />HEALTHY.<br />Amazing price.
4;Great Coffee;Very good coffee if you like yours on the stronger side.  I usually like coffee on the weaker side, but I like this one and love the packaging.
1;What a rip-off!!!;These boxes are very small! Each is 1.2oz .
5;Mango is really mango-e;"If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an ""organic"" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the ""essence of mango"" you would smell from an air freshener."
4;Want some Booty?;This is a remarkable product.  An amazingly long expiration date for a preservative free food, a great cheezy flavor, and you should not fear to buy this product in bulk, especially if you really enjoy it.
5;Great tasting;The price was as fantastic as the taste. So convenient to make and no messy powder  that is hard to dissolve.
5;The best corn chips out there;Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.
5;Great;This hot chocolate does not have the strongest flavor, but it is incredibly creamy and smooth. Definitely worth the price for that much.
3;Dented Cans AGAIN!;I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).
5;Great raw food that dogs love...and grain free!!;We have loved ZiwiPeak for a few years now, when it was introduced to us by our local pet boutique.  (which is now out of business, unfortunately) It is available in venison, venison-fish, beef.
5;Great Rice or Pasta Substitute;My family enjoys eating quinoa as a tasty substitute for rice, or pasta.  If you like those and couscous, you will probably find you like quinoa, too.
4;Attention AMAZON:;"I think Amazon is doing a disservice to Wellness Dry Dog Food by mingling all the reviews together rather than separating the opinions out, based on the particular type and ""flavor"" of the Wellness food being reviewed.  I was researching the food for SMALL BREEDS and zeroed in on that particular type, but the reviews were all over the place talking about many of the other varieties."
5;YUM;I'm doing the HCG diet and am trying to be good about what I put in my coffee.  This is really good!  Very vanilla flavor and no after taste that I got with the plain stevia I ordered before.
5;Good stuff;Back to buy more.  Love this tea!  I have had a lot of different green tea, jasmine green tea is my favorite, and this is my favorite jasmine green tea of any that I've tried.
5;Stash Green Tea;I bought this tea for my husband because he loves tea..
2;Not very happy with product;I received the chestnuts and my family was quik to open one however the taste of chestnut tasted bad.  I took the bag and the smell was wrong.
5;Doggone good!;Due to our dog's  intestinal issues it was suggested we give him a couple tablespoons of pumpkin with his meals. Not the pie mix, but pure, organic pumpkin.
4;Has mostly cleared up our vomiting problem;My 5-year-old kitty has always eaten Science Diet (first the kitten formula, then the Adult Indoor formula), and has always been very healthy with a gorgeous coat and lots of energy.  A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.
5;My kids love this stuff!;I originally bought this on a whim at my local Minnesota Walmart on clearance because I love Mango.  This stuff is really good with great mango flavor.
5;wow, I'm impressed;May not so creamy as ghiradelli nor milka, but texture and taste is so sublime. Very impressive quality at all.
4;Maybe not that filling, but healthy - variety pack;If your child is picky take note:  the apple and pear look the same but the strawberry & banana are in tiny pieces and are red colored.  For some reason, my 2 1/2 year old did not eat those.
3;A little bland;I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour.
1;Terrible...And Not Cheap;"I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away.  The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to ""thick."
5;Bland? Yes. Amazing?! YES!;Okay, so everyone knows the crispbreads aren't the most flavorful thing in the world, but so what? They are offering you a huge percentage of your necessary daily fiber intake. They honestly aren't bad topped with peanut butter (I use Jif natural) or cream cheese.
5;Excellent;This coconut oil has a nice smooth texture at a reasonable price. We use it for homemade oil mixtures and for message.
5;Great Salami for the price;This is a great deal for 6 packages of salami. This has a great taste, a little oily but what packaged Salami isn't?  A great buy to have for potlucks and last minute sandwiches.
4;Stash Irish Breakfast;This is a great loose leaf tea.  A very fresh taste for the first cup of the morning.
4;Good food, good price;Got this for my lab, who is far from a fussy eater.  Wanted to get her something healthy and not break the bank.
5;Great coffee;This is a rich but not bitter coffee and the price is great.  I love it and will buy more.
5;Superbly delicious;If it wasn't for the price I would've eaten this everyday. I can't stop! It's just really good.
3;Doesn't taste as good as I thought;I had originally thought that this Starbucks coffee will taste as good as the ones they sell at their stores. But it is not as good.
5;Great Sweet, Fresh Taste in a Handy Size;I love the taste of fresh sweet corn. That isn't always possible.
5;I love it;It's non-carbonated so its easier to drink and it tastes great. It goes great with almost any type of meal unlike red bull or most carbonated drinks which taste terrible.
5;The Most amazing body cream EVER!!!!;I wish this would come in gallon bottles..
5;Love it;My doggies loves it.  Didn't take her too long to figure out.
4;Guar gum for the gluten intolerant stomach;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;very hard to chew;lots of junks in it, many fats, lots of chicken wastes and mix with spices. only the spices is good, but i don't taste much beef in it.
5;Kitty is in love!;This stuff looks disgusting, it really does. It's like meat soup that has been pureed.
5;Great Stuff;I ordered this on a lightning deal so I got a great price. This jerky is tender and delicious.
5;My dog loves these;My dog loves these. They've been great for house training, leash training, and especially crate training.
5;Delicious and Filling!;These Stilia bars are wonderful. They taste great, are only 100 calories and my whole family loved them - especially the rabbits.
5;Very Nice Hemp Oil;"This Hemp oil is great! It has a unique ""nutty"" flavor that, should I say, is very good. I usually mix it in with my salads along with some Italian dressing."
5;Gin.Gins;I really like the taste of this candy, just the right amount of ginger.I have to take a fair amount of medicine in the morning after I eat breakfast.
5;Good product, great deal!;Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can
5;Great Coffee;Good flavor, I got this for my fiance, and I started drinking it too.  Definitely a seasonal coffee as you will get sick of it after a week.
4;Very good;Very good flavor, only a bit of alcohol away from being perfect. Freezing some of it makes great flavored icecubes for drinks.
5;Short and Sweet!;Hungry but can't cook? Eat this.<br />Hungry but want to snack lean? Eat this.
2;Original PopChips;Bought the Original flavor from the store and just tried them tonight. They were very greasy and salty.
3;Not one of my Favorites;I don't know, people seem to like this k-cup, but it just did not do it for me.  Maybe I got a bad batch, as it was simply overpowering for me.
5;I wake up thinking about this coffee!!;I have been using a Keurig for a few months now and have tried lots of different K-Cups. The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast Coffee is my favorite! It has a wonderful aroma and a deep, rich flavor and color.
2;Surprisingly tasteless;Sadly, this has very little flavor, and is definitely creamy to the point of almost being watery.<br />It does not really taste like almonds at all.
5;The best apricots;California dried apricots are the best available.  They are much better than Mediterranean ones, which have an unpleasantly bitter taste that may be due to the over-use of sulphur as a preservative.
5;Tastes Like Kool-aid;And I don't allow Koolaid in my home because of all the sugar.  This is a great alternative for me and the kids.
4;Freeze dried liver as dog treats;My little pupster loves these things. She is not exactly Ms.
4;Picky Shih-Tzu eats it mixed with canned food....;I was surprised when my picky shih-tzu, who won't  eat dog food snacks, ate Beneful Original Dog Food. Granted he only eats a few pieces when I put it on top of his canned food serving, but he does eat it.
5;Savory sure-fire chicken spice mix!;I'm an avid cook and enjoy trying commercial and homemade spice mixes.  Like most people, I'm familiar with the 'Pride of Szeged' brand from their bright red tins of zingy-tasting Hungarian Paprika.
1;Not to myy liking taste wise that is...;Let me start by saying that I love tea. I love Numi's teas the best as they are organic and also fair trade products.
5;Dr Oz recommended!;Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically).
4;Great stuff, fast lunch!;If you're like me and get tired of packing lunches, be sure to grab these! They just make it SO much easier and it's easier for the person who's eating the lunch as well.  They taste great too - I like this one better than the regular canned version.
5;An Easy Way Eat Healthier;I usually add these to the chocolate smoothie we enjoy in the mornings.  Raw milk, organic cocoa powder, banana, ice, peanut butter, some turbinado or stevia, and a handful of these nibs.
5;chew on the dog!;Classic Tim Burton, Micheal Keaton at his best, and the movie that introduced me to Winona Ryder. I love it.
3;Just ok;I am a dark chocolate lover. These chips have too much of other things in it like vanilla and soy lecithin and too much sugar.
5;Delicious Light Spicy Flavor;"I came across this particular flavor at a local store quite by accident. If you are a bold/strong coffee person, it may be too light on ""coffee"" flavor as cited in some of the reviews, but if you accept it on its own merit instead of expecting a bold coffee flavor, it's a delicious light spicy flavor."
5;Energizer Bunny... ur, uh, Gel;I've used this gel for years now for my long distance running.  Easy on my stomach and I love the taste of the plain.
5;I plan on buying more of this salt;I like this salt with its own grinder.  I use it myself and also have put it in gift baskets.
5;Delicious;Who would've thought a snack that is not bad for you, could taste so good.  Both my husband and I really enjoy these.
2;Heartburn.;I have made several shakes with cocoa powder, whey, agave syrup, and non-fat milk (my normal mixture) and ended up with heartburn.  I have used another natural brand of whey with these same ingredients for months with no problems, so I suspect this brand might be the culprit.
4;Works well but too dense;"My dog likes to chew it but it's ""heavy weight"" even for this petite size. It's almost like 1/2 of her lunch."
1;Unpleasant taste;I tried this soup recently and the taste is less than desirable. It has a lot of what tastes and looks like beef bullion.
5;No Maltodextrin!!!;This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.
5;dogs enjoyed them;the chews arrove here, as promised.  My yorkied love them, and they are good for their teeth.
5;my son LOVES this stuff;An absolute favorite in my house. My son would drink ten of these a day if we let him! He even prefers them to the chocolate variety, to which my daughter is partial.
5;Great deal for quality tea;Considering you usually pay 5-6 dollars for a couple ounces in a regular tea shop, this is a great deal. I use it to make homemade caffeine-free chai.
5;Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle;**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.
4;Really nutty, but melts to the packaging;I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that.
5;A healthy alternative;These are a much healthy alternative to most chips and they taste great.  They have a great crunch and flavor and don't have that bad after taste that most baked chips have.
5;Great dog snack;Really like these treats for our dogs - a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  The snacks are grain free, the ingredients contains no list of chemical additives, just Salmon Meal, Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes, Vitamin E, and Zinc.
5;Delicious!;We had previously tried the Santa Fe fat-free dehydrated refried beans, and liked them a lot.  So, we decided to give these a try too.
5;The only thing that stops my mid day yawns;I own a coffee shop and can have a shot of espresso anytime I want. .
5;Great seeds;Fine seeds.  Before I bought these, I was getting robbed, paying too much even at Walmart, wondering how stores could afford to use caraway seeds in rye bread.
5;Excellent quality;This seller consistently provides high quality edibles for very reasonable prices, and this Fleur de Sel is no exception.  Extremely tasty, well packaged, and timely delivery.
1;I wouldn't buy any dog food made by Diamond (chicken soup is only one of many);Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.
5;pumpkin pleasure;I was very pleased with the organic pumpkin. It tasted like it came out of my own garden.
5;What a wonderful product!;My husband loves sardines, and so do I. The Crown Prince brand of Kipper Snacks is by far the best.
1;May not be totally gluten free;I ordered this for my mom, who has Celiac disease. She could not tolerate it, it gave her bad diarrhea, as if it had gluten in it.
5;Awesome Tea;I bought this Tea for my girlfriend who is ery health conscious. So far she is loving it and it tastes good too.
5;Our cats love these!;We have been buying these toys since our oldest cat was a kitten in 2004 and they are the favorite of all three of our cats (and many others that we've given them to).  They are safe to be left out but do eventually wear out and break (it takes about a year of our cats heavy use and us stepping on them occasionally).
5;Good tasting coffee;Have been using this bean to make the morning mocha's for about 6 months, its a good quality bean.  Makes a nice dark flavorful espresso with good crema.
5;Great alternative to poptarts!;My kids and I love these for a quick breakfast. They are good warmed up or straight from the box, and better ingredients that traditional poptarts.
2;Sticky mess...;As always, Amazon delivered quickly and as promised -- NO problems with Amazon packaging.  But, like many reviewers before have noted, the little creamer cups are haphazardly scattered in the inside box, which subjects them to crushing, opening and spilling.
5;delicious!;Like most people, I was very skeptical about purchasing baklava online. From my experience, if one leaves out baklava out for a long time, it tends to get extremely hard and the honey drips all over the place.
4;Best-smelling coffee ever!;Buy it for the amazing smell.  I opened the bag and was in love.
5;GREAT with or without milk!;"I bought these because they were on sale, and I am SO glad I did.  These are great with milk for breakfast, and even better dry as a ""midnight snack"" while watching TV."
5;My Experience;Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)<br /><br />Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve.
3;Smaller than I thought...;By the look of it, it looks like a round item.  It wasn't.
5;Excellent if you don't read ingredients!;These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.
5;If you love hazelnuts and nut butters, you must try this;I'm a devoted hazelnut lover. This stuff is basically the hazelnut analog of sweetened natural roasted creamy peanut butter.
5;Great Organic Baby Food;Earth's Best baby food really is the best!  I make most our of baby food but because of where we live it is very difficult to buy organic fruits/veggies..
1;Very Weak;If you like dark, bold and strong coffee, you will not like Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee.  The product is packaged in convenient one cup serving packets, but it's very weak and almost tasteless.
4;worlds best chocolate!;Hard to find in the USA, only a handful of cities have a leonidas store.<br />Only reason they didn't get 5 stars was that the chocolates arrived in imperfect condition after shipment.
1;Don't Buy Online!;Just to let you all know, this product is readily available at GNC for $5.49, same amount of bags.
4;Refreshing flavor, low carbonation;The Izze Sparkling Grapefruit is a refreshing, albeit sugar-loaded, soft drink that comes in a slender 8.4 ounce can.
4;My dog loves this food.;My dog loves this food, The meat pieces are soft and chewy with the green bean and potato accents for crunch.  I like the price through monthly ship program.
1;Yuck.;Maxwell House is by far the worst coffee brand. I am sort of a coffee snob when it comes to quality, but come on.
5;Delicious AND LOW Sat-Fat;These are delicious - crunchy, with a nice firm texture and only a faint banana flavor (the fruit loses its sweetness during the drying process, and only added sugar makes it taste like its fresh form).<br /><br />Other banana chips do tend to have a lot of saturated fat.
5;Great deal and a great meal;I really enjoyed this corned beef hash and the size of the can makes an extra large portion.  I found that the 25-ounce size is also a great price.
2;Alright but there are better bars out there;I find the Earnest Bars to be far too sweet, especially this bar that has so many raisins in it.  I can taste the almonds, but the sweetness is overwhelming.
5;nice smell;I hate liccorice but this oil smells good. I use it on my dog's bed after washing it.
3;tastes great but...;I will not lie. I love the taste of this cereal.
5;Excellent;When we visit Louisiana we buy this by the dozens. When we don't visit Louisiana, we order it online.
5;A favorite.;This is so far my favorite packaged curry. Its a bit spicy and goes great with rice.
5;My dog loves these.;After having 11 teeth pulled by the Vet, I had to find a convenient way to brush my dogs teeth.  I have used these for 6 months and he has not had any more teeth problems.
1;Over a dollar for a K-cup?;The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).
5;A delicious bribe;I got these for the dogs next door, who would bark like crazy every time I opened my back door! Not the peaceful idyllic life I had imagined. So my idea was to get them behave with treats.
5;Great taste & value;Decaf french roast is hard to find in the grocery stores here. Tully's, Peet's and Starbucks make it but their price is high and their grinds are too harsh for my taste.
3;Too Weak For My Taste;I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.
5;I've tried lotsa' EVOO, this is the best tasting!;I have purchased olive oil from all over the world, literally.  Spain, Italy, Greece, etc.
5;great for dieting;These crackers are crisp and filling and taste great with peanut butter, lunch meat etc.  They really fill you up and are high in fiber and low in fat.
5;Great pasta;Colavita always makes excellent pasta. Their olive oil is also outstanding for its taste and quality.
5;Amazing Flavor;I recently tried these at Expo West and they are amazing!  More flavorful than any candy bar on the market and full of healthy omega-3's, protein and fiber.  This is one product worth the price.
5;Walkers Shortbread Finger;Walkers makes great shortbread.  The fingers are by absolute favorite they are cover in fine sugar.
5;best chili mix ever;I've tried all the mixes you can get at the grocery store.  When they didn't satisfy, I began a process to come up with the ultimate chili mix of my own.
1;flavor doesn't last;tastes great for about 10 seconds, really.<br />Then, it is tasteless.
5;Best hot cereal.;Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain cereal is wholesome warmth for the morning.  I heat mine (1 cup water to 1/2 cup dry cereal) for 3 minutes in the microwave (generous size bowl to allow for boiling) and then mix with a carton of low-fat fruit yogurt.
3;Prefer the vanilla;This stevia is good, dont get me wrong, but the chemical taste is more prevalent as opposed to the hazelnut or vanilla flavor, which probably seems ironic..
3;Just okay...;Sickeningly sweet, and I'm not a fan of the fact that it contains soy protein isolate. It's convenient on the go, but a bit too high carb for my usual low-carb diet.
5;A simply fantastic noodle alternative;I would first like to thank all of the reviewers who mentioned the fishy smell. Knowing that it was an offputting smell did help me take the plunge in actually tasting the noodle.
5;Some of these reviews are ridiculous...  It's great - period;I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, nutrition freak, hippy, etc..
5;Excellent coffee, upscale packaging but lacking in description;Most attractive and functional packaging (individually foil-sealed pods) but while it wasn't hard to figure out the usage once I had them, it certainly was a mystery what exactly they were going to be prior to their arrival. Please note I would have expected the product description to give me some idea of whether this is produced for a single serve maker and if so, for which one(s).
4;Tamicon Tamarind paste;Good product for the price. Can be used in curries, chutneys and as a condiment.
5;Herbal Alternative to Caffeinated Beverages, A Different Rooibos;*****<br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush.
4;The slices are, um, greasy;This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet.
5;sweet tea  Wow!;I'm addicted to this tea. It is not to sweet I must have 2 to 4 a day.
5;Can't ask for more;Everything was in the box and all in date. They added a 10% off coupon for their site and I got the package 6 days ahead of time.
5;Greenies Rock!;I used to buy these at Petsmart - not anymore!  Same exact product considerably cheaper.  I usually tack them on to other orders to take advantage of free shipping.
5;Tastey and Timely;"These Petits Fours have become a holiday tradition.  For at least five years, my now-seven-year-old granddaughter has looked forward to selecting a ""cakey"" after dinner."
4;good water;I like the bottle that this water comes in, it's a harder type of plastic, so it doesn't crush in your hand like many of the other brands.  I gave it only 4 stars because of the sodium content.
3;Good flavor but a bit tough;I really like the flavor of these but they are a bit tougher than I am used to.  I dont think I will be buying them again.
5;I'm with the crowd. Best all purpose sauce ever.;I use this in and on meats, fish, poultry, vegies, all purpose dip et al. It's cheap and very very special.
1;horrible synthetic taste;I absolutely love the plain Zico Coconut water - I drink at least 1 or 2 of the large tetrapaks a week.  I have also enjoyed some of the other brands Mango flavored coconut water (O.
4;sharp cheese;Good sharp cheddar. Liked the fact that it can packaged as two separate pieces.
4;Good gravy - mild taste;I enjoyed and plan to buy more of this product.  So far I've only tried the savory herb.
5;Great food topper for my dogs;I have been feeding this to my 1 year old maltese and 4 month old chihuahua. I mix this in with their dry food and they both enjoy it a lot.
5;black english tea;Excellent tea and very enjoyable after a long day at the office.  also great on cold winter days and some R&R while crafting.
5;Healthy food that my dog loves;My dog LOVES this food. I have spent hours researching healthy dog food and my vet recommended Newman's Own.
5;Good, earthy black tea;This is a very tasty, black tea with an earthy, slightly malty flavor. Best for the morning.
5;Coffee Shop Taste;I Bought This To Try Because It Was Cheap!<br />It Tastes As Good As The Coffee Shop I Visit.<br />So Good, That It Is Now On, My Subscribe and Save.
5;Very good treat;I use these sticks for people treats and dog rewards.  I show my dogs and have found that they love these jerky sticks.
5;Raisin Bran Crunch pack of 4;We couldn't beat the price on this subscribe and save deal. Raisin Bran Crunch is one cereal every age will eat at our house, and we go through at least a box a week.
1;Taste like plastic;I recently purchased this item on behalf of my sister. She has several chemical alergies.
5;Delicious!;Delicious, healthy beans with BPA free lining. They are great on salads, in hummus, or just alone.
5;Wonderful full bodied flavor no bitterness.;Our favorite coffee is Donut Shop by Coffee People and we were curious with this new type of Kcup. Although not the same as Donut Shop this coffee has a wonderful flavor.
5;Great buy;These are great and the price is very good. Try them and you will see.
5;Awsome Snack for Kids..and Adults;I first discovered this product in our local Food Lion grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.  I searched everywhere, because my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loved them.
5;Best Cayenne Pepper I've Found. Don't Let The Other Reviews Fool You.;I've used 6 different kinds of cayenne pepper so far, 5 of which were organic.  My uses include spicing up foods, as well as an ingredient in the lemonade made while doing the Master Cleanse (it's NOT a diet! :) (by the way, Shady Maple Farms Grade B maple syrup is the best I've found as well).
1;Made 2 of my dogs throw up each time they ate them;I bought these Merrick Lamb Training Treats from my local petco. I gave them to all three of my dogs and one threw up.
5;Perfect for training;My husband and I are vegetarians and we were looking for a treat we could use for our puppy's training sessions that wouldn't gross us out. We typically make our own peanut butter dog treats for our dogs, but they're too big and too crunchy to work for training.
5;bringing home a taste of texas;Those of you that think you've had the best croutons and never had Texas Toast style, you've been living a lie.  A cold hard lie.
5;Great Variety - Great Price;Researched the product line on their official website.  Really liked what I read about the ingredients, where/how it is all made.
5;YUMMY!;We made these for breakfast today and they were delicious!  The pancakes are very tasty, hearty and filling, an added bonus, both of our kids LOVED them.  I've tried a variety of gluten-free products and mixes and believe I have now found a company that makes some of the best-tasting products out there.
1;Does not work;Does not have any effect on puffiness or dark circles.  Used it twice a day for thirty days.
5;Great caffeine laden tea;I've been drinking this Stash jasmine blossom green tea for the past 5 years because it's loaded with an unexpected kick of caffeine.  It's a good afternoon energy boost if you're not into coffee past 12PM, like me.
5;Great treat;As always Jelly Bellys are the best. I bought a different assortment for each of my kids for Easter.
1;Why you list this item if you don't have it.;Ive' waited 2 weeks, and it still said will ship 3 weeks later.I don't understand, why you need to list this item if you don't have any stocks.
2;Not enough truffle flavor;The oil does not have enough truffle flavor.  The price is good, but I would try a more expensive oil in order to get more essence of the truffle.
5;Colman's Mustard Powder;We love this powder.  Just add a wee bit of sugar and salt to about 1/2 cup the powder.
5;More Fast Food Flavors AT HOME!;Fewer trips to the drive-thru and more preparations to make a variety of at home meals possible is the goal. Tacos and Fajitas are fast food favorites.
5;Happy Bellies Organic Baby Cereals with DHA + Pre & Probiotics, Brown Rice, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6);I found this a good introduction to solids for our first daughter. So it was an easy decision to go with this again now that our first son is almost 6 months old.
5;Great as training treats!;I took my golden retriever puppy to obedience school and these were the treats that they recommended for all the dogs for training! I break each treat into about four pieces so that after she does something right she gets a quick reward. My dog doesn't go wild for food/treats but she will do absolutely ANYTHING for one of these.
2;Were Great From Amazon;
5;Good Stuff;a very good, bold coffee. Rich & Bold.
1;Incorrect Product Description;The product description reads:<br /><br />..
3;Very drinkable alkaline water;"Without wading into the controversies surrounding the use of alkaline drinking water to improve body chemistry, I can share with you that this water is very drinkable in that it is largely indistinguishable from our tap water notwithstanding its ""ionization"" and the addition of electrolytes.  It did not upset my stomach or cause any other physical reaction, as is sometimes reported when using other alkaline water products."
5;The best wasabi peanuts out there!;I first had these at the Aloft hotel chain, and from there was on a mission to find them for personal consumption. The shipping was very quick, and the wasabi peanuts were fresh in a resealable bag, and stayed fresh for the month that I munched through them.
5;Smart Fries- Best snack ever!;There are not many things that taste good that you can eat an entire bag for 1.5 grams of fat!  This product is great for diets and an awesome alternative to chips.
4;Tasty pulpy juice;I was surprised at the taste of this drink. I was expecting a sweet tasting drink but it turned out to be kind of tart with a sweet aftertaste, kind of pleasant.
4;Lipton Cup-a-Soup, Spring Vegetable;I didn't rate this product 5-stars because of its high sodium content (a drawback it shares with most convenience soups).  However, I recommend this as being unusually tasty!  When I use this for lunch (unaccompanied by sandwich, etc), I often mix in a few spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce in order to make it slightly more filling.
3;"Don't buy because its ""green""";Don't buy this just because it is a natural product, buy it because you want healthy food in a convient (but extremely wasteful) packet.  Taste is terrible from my perspective, it is pears, broccoli, and spinach
1;so disappointing;I ordered 3 boxes of 18 each..
5;Quality food;My cat was pulling his fur out and gnawing on himself until he would bleed, so I switched him to this food. He stopped that day.
5;Tastes great;I bought this because I thought it was the same as white sweet potato flour. I was disappointed but then after I baked cookies w/ it, they were actually good.
1;TASTES LIKE TURPENTINE!;DISGUSTING!!!! I really don't know how there are reviews about this product being good. I bought this product because I didn't have any homemade amchar left and would have to wait for someone to go the distance to acquire some more.
5;Good results;This is the second type of dried mushroom I have used so I am not an expert.  They were clean and free of grit but I did rinse per the instructions.
5;Excellent;I have three different types of oatmeal at home: rolled (the old fashioned Quaker), a blend found at Costco, and this steel-cut from Country Choice. I also have a box of instantaneous oatmeal for trips, but I do not consider it at home.
2;Experimenting;A few drops of MiO caused the water in my glass to turn brownish red. I tasted it.
5;Love it!;My dog loves this food, and our vet and trainer both highly recommended it.  His coat is shiny and healthy and I like the fact that it is grain-free, which is good for dogs with allergies.
5;Great training treats!;Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.
5;Great Treat;My dogs love this treat. I use it to train them and just for fun.
4;Genuinely good cookies for a variety of dietary restrictions;"Jo-Sef Square Cinnamon Cookies, Gluten Free<br /><br />Genuinely good cookies for a variety of dietary restrictions 4*<br /><br />Though the package highlights the ""gluten free"" aspect of these cookies made with rice and soy flours, they will also provide a pleasant treat for those with a variety of other restrictions:  they are ""processed in a dedicated gluten-free & nut free facility,"" lactose/dairy free, casein free, egg free, wheat and corn free .."
1;Mislead thinking only 2 ingredients.;I was very disapointed that it states only 2 ingredients and find to my dismay it also contains salt and oils.<br />Mislead or misread of advertisement.
5;If you want to know what espresso is suppose to taste like this is it!;Best espresso. Illy is the real deal.
5;Tasty;I decided to purchase these KCups because they were priced right.  The flavor is very good.
5;Seriously Delish!;WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet.
5;Almost  as good as fresh!;"The convenience of these fruit cups cannot be overstated.  And a great help if you need to exert ""portion control"" as well ."
1;Disappointed.;I thought that this would be great way to buy snacks for the kids lunches. Try it out.
3;great product, not-so-great packaging;i love these freeze-dried strawberries.  my toddler loves them too.
2;Tasted like cardboard with salt;"The following ages in our household tried these ""french fry"" sticks: 44, 37, 18, 10, 5 and none particularly liked them.  They were just very bland and did not really taste very potato-like to us."
5;Best American-made Italian Marinara;This is one delicious sauce! It's one of the few marinara sauces one can pour straight from the jar on the most simple thing and have it be turned into a gourmet meal. Pour over ravioli, tortellini, use on pizza or as a dipping sauce, and you are ready to eat! So easy and good.
4;would recommend;three main complaints, otherwise happy. The plastic used for construction is very flimsy and I fear breaking it every time I use it.
3;cookie fingers;The fingers were good but got very dry quickly. They were very much like baklava.
5;When you get tired of searching...;Living in Florida near the water resulted in lots of shrimp in the freezer last fall. We enjoy our fried shrimp lightly coated, and this cracker meal is one of the best.
5;Good for you and great taste;Decided to try the steel coat oat meal for health benifits and was really impressed with taste and texture. The oats come in a steel can, which is different.
3;Not bad, not great either.;I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down.  This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.
5;Excellent variation of the Ginger Chew!;I bought these as well as the Chimes brand in this flavor..
5;THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!;"I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days.  Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the ""drop"" afterwards."
5;Great Vibrant Orange Flavor Tea;I've had lots of hot and iced teas, and this is one of my favorite teas.  I prefer iced tea and this is really good for iced tea.
5;It is well worth buying it!!!!;This product is great it isn't drying, it leaves your skin baby smooth and hydrated I definitely can see a slight difference so far. The only thing is that I thought that it would be bigger, it is really kind of small, but a little goes a long way.
5;great bears;These are great, soft & all the different flavors are fantastic.  I put a jar of them at my work & everyone raved over them, even people who say that gummies stick to their teeth really liked these ones.
1;Yuck!;I respectfully have to disagree with the other two reviews.  These olives taste disgusting to me.
5;Stuffed Bread;This stuffed antipasto bread was better than expected.  The outside is crusty.
1;"It says ""6-pack"" but I only received ONE jar";"I think this product listing is clear-enough - Both the title and the product image read ""6-pack."" The delivery arrived at my door in a box large enough to fit a microwave oven."
5;great;They are so good i eat the whole bag in an hour LOL i don't know if that's a good thing ..
1;50% to 10% Juice? New Rockstar Juiced Fails to Rock;Been drinking Rockstar Juiced since it came out. I hardly noticed the 70% to 50% change in their formula, but the new 10% forumla is horrible.
3;Strange tasting;"I do not know what it is exactly but this is a strange mix of ingredients. Perhaps it is the ""? garlic crackers in it, but I get a stomach ache every time I eat this."
5;Yummy and Healthy;I bought this at the health food store and read up on the benefits of this product.  Its nice to know that I'm eating something that will benefit my body instead of something that will make me ill.
4;Cheaper at Fred Meyer!;I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.
1;Why is this no longer available through Amazon prime;Watch the price on this.  You can buy in the Grocery store for less now.
3;Sliced Hard Chicken Hot Dogs for Cats!;"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
5;I love these.;I've tried just about every knock off, wanna-be slim jim there is and nothing comes close to the original. These are perfect snacks if you are on a low carb diet.
5;Revised and Yummy;I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.
5;Great product;I live in Puerto Rico and cannot find Thai food here, let alone ingredients.<br />I bought this and the red curry paste too.
5;the best tasting turkish delight;I ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious .I took it to my parents house for my sister's birthday among her gifts which I also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this Turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and I told them amazon go there they have everything,amazon thank you as allways bringing us International flavors without leaving our homes.
5;fantastic tea;Tea is good delicious.  You would never know it was green tea it is so mild.
5;Yummy, Full of Fiber and a Good Value;This extra large size of Frosted Mini Wheats is an economical, tasty way to get a whole bunch of fiber into your diet.  Mini Wheats are a great deal like Triscuit crackers, only the biscuits are sweet instead of salty.
1;I think that I got a bad batch or they changed the ingredients;I tried an envelope from two different boxes and both didn't taste good to me at all. I've bought this in the grocery store before and always liked it and other betty crocker potatoes but either I got a bad batch from amazon or they changed the ingredients.
5;LOVE this stuff, on my 3rd order!;I totally love this stuff.  It's water after all, so it shouldn't have an intense flavor, but I'm still disappointed in all the negative reviews.
1;Don't buy - Quality issues;I bought two boxes of these at a local Target and both boxes had cookies that had moldy spots all over.  I contacted the vendor and told them about the issue and they responded that it was probably nothing more then an isolated incident.
5;Crunchy, salty, sweet...finally, a Superbowl snack that scooores!;These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.
4;We like this Italian Blend;Me and my wife like this particular coffee flavor for its mildness and taste. We don't like super bold coffees that leave bitter taste in your mouth.
5;So good - tastes like sushi without the fish.;I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.
5;Lavazza coffee;I bought this coffee for my husband who loves his expresso machine.  He gave it rave reviews and he can't wait for our next shipment.
4;Great Value but It is Just Coloring;This is a great value you what you will find elsewhere.  Yes the packaging is terrible but it is a box within another box.
5;PERFECT Single  Serve  Size!!  Great for kids at COLLEGE too!;In contrast to the one star review here, I love these little cans of bean dip!  Same great product that's sold in the chip aisle at the supermarket. They are perfect for a single serving size and doubly perfect for my sons away at college.
5;Great afternoon tea!;Wonderful hard to find black tea with the bold smokey taste of Ancient China. Great as an afternoon tea especially on a cold day.
1;A rip off;I thought I was buying 10 lbs for this price. Shame on me for not reaing.
5;YUM!;"I'm a such sucker for sweets. So when I saw these ""candy bar alternatives"" at REI during their labor day weekend sale, I just couldn't resist! I snatched up a few flavors (honey graham, smores, and rocky road) along with some other bars to try out."
5;Always a hit;I've served this spread many times and people can't get over how good it tastes. I like it with wheat crackers, but it's also great with gingersnaps.
5;Grapenuts like cereal without the mouth injuries;I love this cereal!  It reminds me of what I remember grapenuts tasting like, but without the sharp texture.  I've been GF for 7+ years so I can't swear its exactly the same, but it certainly hit the craving.
5;A Stomach Saver  - and tons of fun!;"When we adopted our dog, she had a variety of medical problems, ""intestinal turbulence"" chief among them.  She was a competitive eater, wolfing down her food in seconds, which contributed to the problem."
5;Great organic nutrition! My son loves it.;My son loves this product it is his second favorite meal. He always gobbles it right up.
5;As good as the real thing;One of the few gluten-free products I make for me that my husband is willing to eat too.  Betty Crocker has done a great job re-creating their regular devil's food cake.
5;These are good pastries;I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.
1;YUCH!;Impressed,as always,with Amazon's expedient delivery. I perused customer reviews before ordering and felt comfortable with my choice (I was going to get the Emeril Bourbon Street blend , which I love) as reviewers gave this a great rating.
5;A Must-Have Item;This salt is outstanding on everything!  It adds so much flavor.  I love the size of the granules and it is so much better than ordinary salt.
5;YUM!;This is just like what they serve in Germany for currywurst. It is light in flavor, not too spicy, but lots of good curry flavor.
1;Too salty to eat;These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top.
4;Not aptly named, but good.;Found this on clearance at the local supermarket, would not have bought it otherwise.  Eggnog tea?  It just sounds so weird.
5;quick fix for hunger;Excellent taste and excellent price. Easy shopping
5;Delicious!;Lemon Larabars are absolutely delicious. I can't stand overly sweet or artificial tasting fruit products, but Lemon Larabars taste like natural lemon and are rather tart.
3;Nonni's Biscotti, Toffee Almond;I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.
5;Bueno!!!;We tried and liked these candy bars when we were in Italy.  Could not find them in any stores in the USA.
5;Really good coffee;So far, this is my favorite blend of coffee. It has a delicious flavor.
4;"San Francisco Bay Coffee ""Decaf"" One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast";I've had the Keurig Brewer for a couple of years and the concept is perfect for my coffee drinking needs, however most available decaf coffees for this brewer are very mild and watered down tasting.  I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the San Francisco decaf, it was bold and rich tasting, definitly my favorite prepackaged decaf for the Keurig brewer.
5;Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic k-cup;I've been drinking this for quite awhile now and have not been disappointed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, I think you will like this.
2;disappointed;I ordered this Mocha Java because the Green Mountain brand was not available.  There is no comparison.
5;Perfect!;I put these rocks on a cake and it was awesome. The rock candy was a perfect texture and added to the flavor of the cake.
5;Great food !  My cat loves it.;This product has worked out very well for us.  And the delivery was a breeze.
5;wish I could buy it at my grocery store....;A delicately flavored custard that is wonderful hot or cold
5;delivery not acceptable;I've gotten these chips before, great price and they came quickly, but this second time ordering is going on a month and I have not received them yet.  I don't understand why?  I was never noticfied that they were back orderd, so what's up.
5;Pleased;I wasn't sure what these pepperoni slices would taste like, (since Bridgford isn't a brand I'm familiar with) but was pleased with the purchase.  Unlike the other review, there was no foul smell upon opening any of the packages.
2;Decent sweetness, lingering aftertaste;I'm using this to sweeten coffee
5;Great product and outstanding price;The tea is really good either hot or cold.  Makes the process so simple using the Keurig cups.
5;Great Cookies;I am on a gluten free diet and find most gluten free snack high in calories and fat.  These cookies are awesome.
2;So little for the money;For the price, there should of been a bigger boxes or more boxes. It isn't anything like I thought it would be or like the product at Universal Studios.
5;I love this stuff;This stuff is so delicious, I love it.  I've already ordered a second round of them.
5;Awesome flavor!;When you open the box the aroma just hits you and your mouth starts watering! And your tastebuds will experience even more pleasure. I have always liked Frosted Mini-Wheats, but there's nothing like this.
5;The only thing that worked;I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information.
1;Contains trans-fat, although the law lets them claim 500 milligrams = 0 grams;"The product is labeled as having ""zero grams"" trans fat, but it also has ""partially-hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel"" [sic] on the online ingredient list as of Nov 2007.  Note that ""Partially-hydrogenated oil"" is ""trans-fat""."
1;Don't taste good;These crackers serve the purpose of getting flax down, with what that does, but they do not taste good, to me.  I'm going to try some other brands and not get these any more.
5;Krinos;I ordered the Krinos Cracked Green Olives.  I enjoyed them a lot.
5;Best Texture in GF Crackers;These have the best texture of any GF crackers I've tried and a nice flavor, though like most GF crackers they're badly under-seasoned. Lightly brushing with water or butter and sprinkling with some kosher salt vastly improves them to something which resembles the 'stoned wheat thins' crackers from the grocery store.
5;Darn good and good for ya;This is a pretty good product. If you have it everyday you really start to feel pretty good.
5;Soft Cat Treats;I always bought these at Food Lion and they stopped selling them.  My cat loves these treat and I get them in Tuna, Caribbean Catch and Seafood.
4;Fresh and tasty!;I found this product to be fresh and tasty. They also sent me a free sample of some of the beef jerky that was the best jerky I have ever had.
5;A post for Ash...;Drain cleaner? HA! HA! That's funny. I'm sure some people would love to suck the vinegary goodness right out of that balsamic soaked clog.
1;Yuck;Even my 8 year old, who was super excited to eat bugs agrees.  These taste terrible, just disgusting.
5;Delightful Earl Grey Tea!;*****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea.
5;Good Stuff;Jet Fuel is good stuff.  Gets me up in the morning.
5;Delicious Spiced Tea (Chai);Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.
5;Wish They Were Organic;These bars are amazingly tasty.  Just the right combination of flavors.
5;Healthy Goodness--Superfood We Should All Include;I've been eating chia seeds for years, ever since I read the book Born To Run.  They are a traditional food of the Tarahumara Native Americans of Mexico and help keep them satisfied when they run long distances.
5;ADDICTED!!!;I cannot live without this coffee! My favorite cup of coffee ever. Without it, I feel like facing work in the morning would be impossible.
5;Works like a charm even for smart and/or finicky dogs;First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works..
5;Great cup of coffee;If you like a no frills plain cup of coffee..
5;My dog LOVES LOVES LOVES these;I could have sworn I'd written a review on these before..
5;Sweet, crunchy, and VERY peanutty;I really enjoy this cereal, but I prefer it as a mix-in to other things, such as yogurt. Alone, it was a little sweeter than I usually eat, but mixing it in balanced everything just right.
5;Great Natural Medicine!!!;To anyone looking for a natural remedie,this is the greatest!I have used other brands,believe me,in price and quality I find this one the best option.Wheatgrass and a healthy lifestyle is all you need to be in the best shape,of course with exercise,drinking water,etc.
1;DO NOT BUY;I bought these for my daughter who drinks decaf due to her heart condition.  14 of the 35 were not even decaf.
5;T H E......B E S T.......L E M O N......J U I C E......( P E R I O D );LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE, (here sold as) 12.5-OUNCE BOTTLES, PACK OF 12, tastes far better than my second choice, (Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice.
4;Why Did I Chose Light?;That, indeed, is the question. After sampling the milk I realized that a better choice would have been regular.
5;great cherries!;If you love tart cherries, these are the best!  Super delicious & not too tart..
5;Love It;This is always sold out at my stores. My kids love this as a quick and easy meal.
5;nice set;This is a neat coffee set for coffee fans. The package is aesthetic, and there are many different unique tastes from different countries that are fun to try.
5;Melt in your mouth explosion;These chocolates are absolutely the best.  I had a bunch of co-workers come by and have some.
4;Very good & very spicy;The delivery was exactly as stated and the product is just what we wanted.  This item is quite spicy, but if used with caution is a wonderful addition to almost anything.
5;The best;These are outstanding. I have made them a regular part of my diet
5;The ONLY flavor that makes sense...;This is just my opinion, but whoever thought to use peppermint as a flavor for menthol cough drops was a pure, simple genius! The peppermint compliments the medication so well, these not only WORK better than any other flavor, but they actually TASTE decent too - like a really strong breath mint.<br /><br />Cough drops, by nature, are going to taste minty one way or another, so why fight it?<br /><br />Usage suggestion: Smash one so it'll dissolve quicker and stir the pieces into some hot chocolate.
3;Nissin Can Do Better;I am a big fan of Nissin Chow Mein noodles. First thing, I got these from Wallmart for 88 cents.
4;Pretty good cat food;Our two six month old male DSH cats love this stuff, but I have to admit there isn't much they won't eat.  We alternate the Friskies with more expensive food in hopes of keeping them healthy and not breaking the bank.
5;good value;I shopped at all the local stores and the cost for the salt was outragous. This is a great value and the quality is the same as what is in the store.
5;Strianese San Marzano DOP tomatoes;Excellant taste and quality. I have been buying DOP San Marzano tomatoes online because I cannot find them locally in stores.
2;Too sweet!;We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.
5;The only wet food my cat will eat!!;I hope Whiskas never stops making Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree.  It is the only wet food that I can get my cat to eat.
5;Navy Bean Soup Mix;I love this soup. Great to put into the crockpot with some fresh onions, garlic, diced ham (or leftover bone from ham) and head to work.
3;Delicious, BUT it contains MSG!;"If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! ""You can't eat just one!""<br />It contains MSG and other ""stuff."" - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though."
3;Not for us;"Good enough for pre-popped I guess. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I miss that ""fresh popped"" taste."
4;it taste very healthy!;this is my second trial of nana's cookie collection.<br />first one was the sun flower.
5;Best Chai Latte EVER;This machine and the teas or coffees available amaze me. This chai latte has to be the best chai latte I have ever experienced.
5;Yummy Tea !;I have a glass of this tea every night before bed. It tastes great and is calming like most Twinings teas I have tried.
5;Worth every penny!;The only negative to this product is that they are very expensive when compared to most other snack options but it's definitely a case of get what you pay for.  We certainly eat other snacks and treats but the cost of these comes from the fact that not only are they organic but dye free as well.
5;Speedy Delivery;I got this product on time and it was packaged just as described. This cinnamon had a wonderful aroma and it is really a lot for a home cook.
5;Can't go wrong with Gerber;Can't go wrong with Gerber. A must have for those who simply can't make it to the store daily, or those who have extra storage.
4;quite good, better than expected;I gave this a shot and it turned out much better than expected.<br />For the price, it cant be beat.
5;Great!!!;These are a big favorite in my house. My 4 year old loves them, and ive gotten in the habit of taking a bag full to work to munch on throughout the day.
4;Not espresso, but a good, dark cup of coffee;I love dark, rich coffee. When I was in Italy, I brought back as much as customs would allow.
4;met expectations;Met expectations--filling, flavorful, one bag is very generous portion, non-greasy.  Flavors are not very distinctive.
5;Great For Celiacs!;This cereal is perfect to use for my husband who has celiac disease. I blend 2 boxes of this cereal to use for breading for fish and chicken or any time I need crumbs for a recipe when I have to substitute gluten free crumbs for wheat bread crumbs.
5;Amazingly good;At a buck a can, it's a luxury, but I can't stop drinking this stuff.  Wish it came in a 2 liter bottle.
5;Yummy peanuts;These peanuts are high quality and they have just the right touch of salt!  The best way to purchase these is in bulk.  Great price and wonderful shipment options.
5;5 STARS MUST BUY!!!;I have been wanting a bamboo plant for my house for quite some time, and I decided after reading the reviews, that I would purchase this one from 9GreenBox. I really liked the looks of the picture on here before I purchased, and hoped it would look the same when it arrived at my house.
5;Jakey loves it!!;"My sister was visiting with her 2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels when my dog Jake, a Golden Retriever Mix, had an opportunity to ""sample"" their Newman's Own dog food while they weren't looking, He loved it"
5;Pop Chips Original Chips;These are the best chips I have eaten. They are popped instead of fried or baked which makes them easier on the weight column.
5;Great product!;I have two dogs. One loved these sweet potato chews right away, while the other snubbed her nose to them twice.
4;Another great flavor from Kool Aid!;I've been drinking Kool Aid since I was a little kid decades ago. I wonder why it took so long to get to this flavor.
5;My dog loves these;My dog loves these and they are good for her too. She comes running when she hears me opening the container.
4;tastes like peanuts to me;These seriously tastes like peanuts to me. They leave the same dry feeling in my mouth.
5;Great Product!;I bought this along with the Nifty Drawer, it keeps all my k-cups I order in bulk in order. This product is for my teas, cocoas, and cider.
4;My cats like it...;I had to give this product a 4 star review because I have three cats, one loves it, the other is indifferent to it and the other wants nothing to do with it. Mind you the cat who wants nothing to do with it is not a finicky eater in any way shape or form.
3;Excellent coffee, price is too high;This is my favorite coffee - strong, delicious and bold. However, the price here is way too high, you can buy it much cheaper elsewhere.
5;Barf bagalicious!;I bought these for my daughter who gets car sick any time we go more than half a mile. Maybe it's my driving?<br />I don't know, but these do work.
5;Happiness in a cup;I don't normally write reviews, but my enjoyment of tea compels me. As someone who has been shifting more and more from bagged tea to loose leaf and delving deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of tea appreciation, I stumbled upon this item.
5;Delicious AND healthy! A pantry staple!;This is excellent soup. No MSG or other horrors as are found in so many standard store brands.
5;Good stuff;THe Cleansing tea helps me in many ways.  I do believe it helps in the health department.
2;Love the idea, can't stand the smell!;My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.
4;popcorn;popcorn is very good. but only makes about half of it.
5;Can't tell this chocolate is sugar-free;I bought this chocolate so I could dip fruit in it for my husband (who's diabetic).  This is the best sugar-free dark chocolate for melting that I've found.
5;soooo yummy;I love peace cereal, this flavor in particular is really delicious.  It's organic, vegan and 10% of profits go to community projects.
4;I like;This tea has a really good aroma and it is sealed in the foil wrap, which I think preserves the aroma and flavor better. It is very similar to the teas you drink at korean or japanese restaurants and I think they actually use the same brand.
4;Nut about Kind Fruit and Nut Delight;I received a box of Kind Fruit and Nut delight for Christmas.  I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.
1;Not as satisfied...package was diff when product arrived;I got sold on the product when I read the review and hope the only reason for the review was that people all over the world have different taste.<br /><br />The tea arrived in a package which does not match the picture.
5;This is not your Dad's instant coffee;"I lived on instant coffee all through college, and came to know its taste and texture all too well.  Because of that, I was skeptical about Starbucks ""instant"" coffee."
5;Peppermint Oil;"This peppermint oil is what I've used for years in my truffles. It tastes natural and not ""fake""."
5;Fabulous Shakes;These shakes taste great.  Many protein shakes are chalky but these are very filling and enjoyable.
5;Simple and Easy!  Love it!;Easy, simple and quick to use.  Very little clean-up.
5;Delicious!;I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty.
4;Not a Bad Cup of Coffee;I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the high priced K-Cups so I decided to try San Francsisco Bay French Roast coffee. First, the price is right.
2;Wrong item;I ordered fruit and nut gronila but received three berry instead.  Unfortunately I had it sent to a friend who was unaware of the mistake and was unable to return by the time I got the item.
1;KNOCK OFF;This is not the product that should come in this box.  I have had this tea from a local store which was excellent, very flavorful pellets.
4;Like it in coffee;"I do not like this for its intended purpose as a hot chocolate drink. To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of ""Double Chocolate Meltdown""."
5;Very Good Coffee;I got this with the purchase of 24 different bold coffee k-cups to find the ones I like best, and so far this is my favorite. It may not be bold enough for some, but it is not supposed to compete with the 'extra bold' varieties.
4;Tastes smooth;It has a smooth clean taste to it. I can drink a lot more of this water with out that bloated feeling I normally get from other water.
3;I think they're out of ideas for dog treats...;I received my Lickety Stik bacon flavored dog treat from the Amazon Vine Program, free in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I thought this product was a kind of stick, based on the name of it.
5;One of Their Best Flavors;Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.
5;MY SPHYNX CAT REACTS TO IT;My Sphynx cat loves the food but he has an allergic reaction to it. It makes him cough/choke intermittently over the course of a few days.
4;Good flavor, but not tangy;I bought this tea because I absolutely love tangy lemons, and wanted a tasty tea that wouldn't keep me up all night.  Based on other reviews, I knew it would have a strong lemony flavor, but the tea is lacking some tanginess that would probably make it perfect.
5;Delicious!!!!!;I eat a lot of granola and different kinds of granola. This is one of the best granola bars I've had.
5;Beats Zataraine Hands Down!;You cannot find this in grocery stores anymore, only the Zataraine Brand, which is not nearly as good.  With the Luzianne product you can spice it up to your personal taste, due to it having a separate red pepper package.
5;Really good chocolate taste;I usually make my own granola by Alton Brown, too, but this is decent.  My husband hates coconut so this is a good cereal for him.
5;seb@clarityconnect.com;The powdered Acai seems to be effective and easy to use. The price is better than some of the liquid ones.
4;Overpriced, but good.;I find the product overpriced, but ordering it online cut the price almost in half.  Good quality, good for seafood gumbo.
1;Boycott Kelloggs;I no longer will buy anything Kelloggs makes because they refuse to label their products when they contain GMOs. Not only that, they are spending lots of $$$$ to keep Americans (they label in the UK and Europe) in the dark about their ingredients.
5;Great product;I was so happy when I discovered dehydrated refried beans.  You can make a little or a lot.
4;Spicy, limey, popchips.;The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal.
1;Boardwalk Blend - Unimpressive;I purchased the Boardwalk Blend because it was described as being a flavor match with Newman's Own (which I like very much). It wasn't a match.
4;Excellent customer service!;UPDATE:  Customer service has been excellent!  They Sent me the container I needed to make the former machine work and an extra bonus for my trouble.  Given the kind of service I have received I would highly recommend their product.
1;Worst meat snack I ever tried;They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.
5;Great!;I buy Tastee Bite Indian meals on-line and at Costco and Whole Foods.  This brand is cheaper and tastes just as good.
4;quite good;I like this tea a lot.  We buy it in bulk.
5;Lipton DeCaf Family size teabags;These tea bags produce tea that tastes good and is great for big pitchers<br />of ice tea.  Refreshment without the caffeine.
5;Dogs love em;These treats are well liked by dogs, the right size and don't smell or feel too gross in your hands.  Not really sure what else to say about them except that if organic is important to you, then these seem to be one of the few options for dog treats out there.
5;Deep, dark, excellent;It's brutishly flavorful and I've kept a stash for years for preparing chocolate sorbet, frosting, anything that requires cocoa. Store in an airtight container in the cupboard.
5;Best Vanilla Ever;I use a ton (okay ..
1;Dog does not like;My dog won't touch these.  She likes almost everything, so I was very surprised.
5;Love the taste!;I just tried one of these, as an afternoon snack. I'm planning on trying one in the morning, on my 6 mile run.
1;Birds will not even eat them.;Um my mother described these as chips that went terribly wrong. Never again the taste was horrible!  The bag smells like feet.
5;Oui!;The most fabulous jam on earth! Heavenly chunky with full pieces of rich cherries. excellent on toast.
4;Kind Bars;We absolutely love this brand of bars and have enjoyed this particular item.  My daughter wont hardly eat breakfast and she swims.
5;Salt;My brother sent me a bottle of Artisan Salt Himalayan Pink Mineral FINE Gourmet Salt. Haven't used regular salt since receiving it.
5;My kitten begs for this canned food;I recently adopted a kitten from a local shelter and shortly after bringing her home she devoloped a respiratory infection, which I'm told is common in shelter cats.  When the vet examined her, her weight was low as she had not been eating well with all the stress and sickness.
5;Melt-In-Your-Mouth Peppermint Sticks;I love these AMAZING King Leo Brand Peppermint Sticks sold by Candy Crate. They melt away in your mouth, from the first stick to the last.
4;Liked it;Pretty high in sugar, but not all that sweet really (which isn't a great thing), but still has a nice coffee flavor and is a great pick me up.  It only has 100 calories so it's also not bad there.
5;Great Tequila;Bought it initially because the bottle shape and then found the tequila to be outstanding.<br /><br />Sadly, I actually wish Kah would sell a plain bottle for me to refresh my skulls because I am starting to grow quite a collection of Black, White and Yellow heads.
1;horrible;The Zico coconut juice in the old tetrapak was great the new in the bottle is the worst I ever had.Just poured 12 bottles down the toilet.
4;Hard;Great if you are cutting back on fat, they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. Extremely dry and hard.
5;This is really good hot chocolate and is easy to prepare;We recently acquired a Kurig B70 from Amazon, and were looking for various products to sample. We came across this hot chocolate, when it was advertised at $9 with free shipping.
3;Not Quite Bold Enough;I am not a coffee drinker, but my husband has a travel cup attached to his hand. This is his review:<br /><br />The coffee was okay.
5;YUMMMM;The oatmeal cookie was so soft and chewy. It really was very yummy as well as healthy.
5;addictive taste;The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.
1;Never had coffe this bad!;This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  Product was weeks from expiring when I received it.
5;best coffee delivered to your door;I dont' like the bitter taste of espresso beans and use this great tasting coffee instead.  It has a lot of flavor and makes the perfect morning pick-me-up-espresso.
5;LOVE this stuff!;Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t.
5;Yummers!;Three little dogs in my household -- and all three love these little morsels. They like the carob flavor too, but they really love both the yogurt and sweet potato varieties.
5;My KIND of Granola!;I have tried just about every type of granola that can be found on a store's shelf, but I must admit that I really like the Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  I ate it with almond milk, in yogurt and alone as a snack.
5;Jerky love;I think this product is a great deal for the price. It is tender & the flavor is awesome.
5;One caveat...;This tea is great! It is very sweet on its own- I like to alternate drinking it with sips of water, which makes the licorice flavor even more pronounced!<br /><br />Just use caution if you have high blood pressure or glaucoma. Licorice root can raise blood pressure.
5;Excellent pasta for the price and the organic quality.;We're a gluten-free household, and this is a staple.  Cooking tip:  Stir frequently on full boil and don't cook for more than 6 or 7 minutes.
5;Delicious green tea;The trouble with many mint teas is that the minty flavoring overpowers the underlying tea leaves. Too often, mint is used to make inferior tea taste palatable.
2;24 hours of chewing and licking but wont buy again;Our lab received this for Christmas. She loved the toy carrying it around all day licking or chewing on the treat cap.
5;Gluten Free On The Go;After being diagnosed as gluten intolerant, I tried Larabar as an alternative to breakfast bars.  I was instantly sold.
5;Get over to Ann's House...;Ann's House Soy Energy Blend is fantastic. First, a word about price: Costco carries Ann's at the moment, but you know Costco- that could change, however, at Costco, I think it's cheaper by about half over some of the sites I've seen.
4;Good Tasting Ramen;So I guess I'm the first to try this on this site. So I shall tell you my experience eating it! Only actual ramen i can compare it to is Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun.
1;Tastes like medicine!;At first, I was excited when I found this product, but that excitement wore off quickly..
5;Very god quality paste. Absolutely necessary for authentic Peruvian rotisserie chicken;Folks often try to make Peruvian style rotisserie chicken without this key ingredient, or substitute a combination of soy sauce and some other pepper in the paste.<br /><br />Trust me, there is no substitute for making the Peruvian rotisserie chicken that everyone knows and loves without this key ingredient.
5;Cappuccino Carmel K-cups;This makes wonderful ice coffee..
5;What I was looking for.;Our local Indian store does not stock this item any more, found this on Amazon, great Darjeeling Tea that I was looking for. We usually mix this with Red Label tea, and it is perfect cup of tea.
5;Hard to find item;I find deep river snacks everywhere but hardly ever find the cracked pepper and sea salt.  Glad that Amazon carries it.
1;Company ingredients not  worthy;I purchased a Bear Naked chocolate / peanut butter granola cereal first part of last year 2009. The Peanut<br />Butter recall came out.
5;Really dark and tasty;For the past few years, I've been buying either Hershey's or Trader Joe's cocoa powder, but I recently decided to splurge on the Nativas brand.  All of the Nativas products I've tried have been of excellent quality, and this one is no exception.
4;Works Well - Recommended;"This Clear ""Men Scalp Therapy"" is good at stopping dandruff and does leave our hair looking and feeling clean, but it also has a fairly strong odor that tends to linger. We are long time ""Head and Shoulder"" users and have been pleased with how well it works on dandruff, but it does not provide the body this shampoo and conditioner combo does."
4;Interesting Fiber Source;"I have to say this is a much harder item to review than I thought it would be.  I couldn't find another chia product locally for comparison, for one thing, and I've never eaten chia before, only watered it on a ""chia pet""."
2;Not as good as the chocolate fudge;I really enjoy the thinkThin chocolate fudge bars, so I thought I would give the brownie crunch a try.  I will just double up on my orders of the chocolate fudge from now on, because these brownie crunch bars are not good.
5;Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!;I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.
5;Best for my dog;We could never give my dog anything cloth like or soft because she would chew on it or take out the stuffing of her bed or blanket. With toys it was the same.
5;YUMMY!;When my daughter and I switched over to all-organic food, the price and lackluster taste of most of the cereals were a shock.  However, this cereal is truly great.
4;Best Energy Drink I've Found;I've tried quite a few different energy drinks and Redline is the one that works best for me. The only thing I would change is to remove the Yohimbine because it causes jitteriness in larger amounts.
5;Wellness is a great grain-free option;I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.
5;Feel good third trimester tea;I'm not a tea drinker, but I thought I had to try this and hopefully would help during labor. At first, i really didn't like the smell, but only after the 1st try, I started liking it! I easily got used to the smell and taste.
3;Attention Chocoholics!;Emerald Dark Chocolate Almonds has just enough dark cocoa to soothe your cravings.  Roasted into the almonds, the cocoa power is not the messy treat that other brands offer.
2;old stock;There was only one in stock--tea bags with strings.  The others were round bags without strings apparently the new style.
4;great pretzels;tastes pretty close to the real thing..
5;Super refresher, subtle flavor from Amazon;This drink is not only refreshing, but satisfying as well. Nourishment with a fabulous taste and reasonable price, conveniently delivered to my home-I love it.
5;Different, and GREAT, Coffee;I'm a big fan of Green Mountain coffee, and the blueberry flavor has been one of my favorites for a while. These K-cups have the same great taste that I know and love from the fresh ground version.
5;Buffalo Bills;These guys are great and provide an excellent product that they stand behind. I highly recommend ordering from them.
5;LOVE IT!;Lipton Green Tea To Go, Energize Blackberry Pomegranate, 10-count is the caffeine I need to make it thru my day without the sugar and icky stuff pop has in it.  I found this while looking for something to drink with caffeine in it - other than three 24-ounce Dr.
4;Delicious, though a bit on the small side.;Delicious cookies.  I actually thought I was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies, not the chewy, but definitely enjoyed these.
2;I hated Maggi seasoning.;I heard good things about the seasoning on the radion but when I tried it, I wanted to throw it out, the flavor was unpleasant.  I like a lot of different foods from different countries so I did not expect to dislike it.
5;Pop these chips...in your mouth!;Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.
1;Too sweet and old;I know this is supposed to be frappe mix so it is going to be sweet but it was way too sugary and it smelled and tasted like an old sweater. I was really looking forward to making green tea frappes at home but I'm just going to throw this stuff out because it is so disgusting to me.
1;Amazon Should Clarify if these ARE NOT San Marzano Tomatoes;I placed an order for these at the beginning of this year as a treat for myself.  I have grown San Marzano tomatoes and am familiar with what they taste like.
5;Best unsung home remedy;I never liked the flavor of this tea initially, and had a box sitting in the back of my cupboard for over a year, until I discovered its use as a home remedy.  It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.
4;a fine tea;so far i have bought the ran and meda watte varieties, as well as the supreme ceylon, several other Dilmah over the counter teas.<br /><br />it is very light and not the least bit tannic.
3;Contains Cinnamon;My kids hate cinnamon (I have no idea why!).  These cookies have a very distinct cinnamon flavor.
1;Some kind of a soapy substance;The instructions on the package say to wash this first before cooking it into something. It really needs the washing, because there is some kind of a soapy substance that comes out when you do, and, judging from my reaction to cooking it, it can cause gastric upsets.
3;It's Really a Cookie!;These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories.
5;Biggest, best Beef Jerky ever!;This is such a delicious bag of Peppered Beef Jerky. I love having a big bag of it to snack on whenever I feel like it.
5;Great Northern Premium Yellow Gourmet Popcorn 12.5 Pounds;I bought an air popper at walmart for cheap and needed some popcorn kernels.  I originally brought walmarts 2 or 3 pound bag of popcorn kernels, but I go thought popcorn like water, so I decided to buy a larger bag.
2;All packaging and tea bags are plastic;This green tea is decent, however, every single tea bag is in its own plastic pouch.  Further, the tea bags themselves are nylon, which they claim enhances the tea somehow.
5;Fantastic salt and such great flavor;This salt is just wonderful.  It has such a great truffle flavor and a higher truffle content than most salts.
5;Five stars for the tea itself;Words cannot even begin to describe my love for this tea. I was looking for an authentic unsweetened tea that contained a substantial amount of antioxidants.
3;Not much blueberry;This is just like many breakfast cereals like Honey bunch of oats at the supermarket.<br /><br />This one is in a resealable plastic bag with a ziplock style closure.
3;You get what you pay for;I was hopeful about these. They taste ok, and certainly are acceptable in most dishes flavor-wise.
1;Warning: Contains Menadione;According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects.
4;tasty;A tasty snack, but a little too sweet.  Don't leave them in a warm car they get horribly sticky.
5;The best coffee;My husband and I were so disappointed when they discontinued Starbucks coffee discs., after reading the reviews on amazon and trying several different coffees, finally found this one, it's the best coffee so far and my husband is very pleased ! I didn't think its possible to find anything to replace the Starbucks coffee but this is it.
1;fruit crisp;i bought asian pear, peaches and fuji apple and was very disappointed.they had no flavor, just like eating cardboard.
4;Great for kids traveling;I am very happy with this product because it is healthy and keeps my kids happy.  The advertising that I found has  the following brief description of the product GoGo squeeZ is the first squeezable, re-sealable, no-mess, all fruit, no sugar added applesauce snack for kids on the go in the US.
4;Good supplement to fresh fruit;"I prefer fresh organic fruit over anything processed, even if the only ingredient is ""organic peaches"". That said, sometimes it's just not convenient (when you're traveling) or possible (winter) to provide good fresh fruit for your kids."
4;Good source of protein;I dont eat red meat, sea food gets expensive, and chicken just gets boring all the time.<br /><br />I purchased nutiva to get a greater variety of protein.
5;Excellent;I highly recommend these from Omaha Steaks. They taste fantastic and no grease like most other burgers you can make yourself.
3;Convenient but Bland;This simple boxed dinner, a Hamburger Helper for the celiac disease market, has one major virtue and one major flaw: it doesn't taste gluten-free.  But it also doesn't taste like much of anything at all.
4;Stinkier than Cadet Bully Sticks;Our dog loooooves bully sticks, and they are great for keeping him occupied when we need to get work done around the house.  These bully sticks seem to be high quality and last as long as other brands.
5;Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee;I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with.
5;Great, tasty, healthy!;It's a great substitute nut butter when your family can't eat any other types. Tastes great, does not have all the junk added to some of the products, stores well.
3;A good way to try the other flavors;I loved half of these flavors, liked one, and dumped the one down the drain. I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three-pack of one of the flavors I didn't like.
5;The greatest rum cake ever.;I fell in love with Tortuga rum cakes during a cruise many years ago.  It is now a tradition for me to ship cakes to my family for Christmas.
4;Good but Short Lived;This gum is a big hit with people who remember this gum from years back, or those that have never seen it.  The fascination of 5 different flavors in a single pack of 17 sticks of gum.
5;Great product, great price and great, fast devliery.;McCanns Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal is difficult to find in stores in my area.<br /><br />As followers of Dr.
3;Not Quite Feeling the Love;These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.
5;Low in Sugar, Carb, and Calories and NO artificial Sweeteners Woo Hoo!!;I am so impressed with this product, I just had to write a review..
5;Doesn't get much better than this;Hands down the best cocoa I've had in a long time.  Kept searching for a decent replacement since my stores stopped carrying this.
5;Everything I expected;For those of you who says this cereal is dry and hard to chew or any similar comments, and for those of you planning on buying this cereal, you must remember that you HAVE to soak the cereal in your liquid for at least 10-15 minuteS! (up to overnight) Whether that liquid is milk of any kind,yogurt, water, whatever. The rule for servings is a 1:2 ratio of cereal to liquid.
5;She Eats 'Em;A picky 14# Westie likes 'em so much she ripped open a bag by herself and ate it all!<br /><br />I like to cut up a piece and stuff it in her Kong..
5;Great;I'm really weird about where I buy chocolate cause so many times I've gotten old, melted, stale, etc products. For some reason, I decided to give these a try.
5;Great cat food;"My cat has had health issues in the past and the vet recommended ""wet"" cat food and specifically this brand.  There are no additives or fillers."
4;Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod;Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.
1;Almost worst jerky I've ever had!;This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all.
5;I'm a convert...no more Cheetos for me!;I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time.  I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.
2;Not Lab durable...;My 7 month old lab mastered the toy in about an hour.  He managed to chew through the rope and render this toy about as useful as a gatorade bottle with no top.
5;Greenies;Received as promised. What can you say about dog treats? I personally haven't tasted one! lol Shipper was prompt for delivery.
5;happy to find this product;I've used this yeast for years but it recently disappeared from the stores.  I am not sure why Fleischmann's is discontinuing this product in favor of versions with additives.
5;Excellent Food!;I have a portly beagle, who is beyond cute but 2 lbs over weight. However, keeping her weight down as she gets older was very important.
5;Fabulous;My dogs LOVE this food.  They had a lot of intestinal problems before we started feeding them this food and all of those problems seem to have cleared up.
5;Delicious pasta;My whole family loves this pasta that is hollow and slightly bigger around than regular spaghetti noodles. I cannot find it anywhere locally, so will continue getting it from Amazon.
5;Great Xylitol candies;My grandson eats these like..
5;Great Deal;I have been taking these pills because I am breastfeeding and wanted to increase my supply. The price on Amazon.
1;too high price for hostess twinkies;this item sells for about $4.95 in most supermarkets when its not on sale.
5;PG Tips in the Pyramid Bags;Once we started using PG Tips, we could not go back to other teas - even if they were easier to find.  PG Tips is the best tea for me in the morning.
5;No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas;My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild.
1;from concentrate! tastes horrible! yuck!;I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket. I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package.
5;Nothing Less than the Best!;Sensational mustard.  My all-time favorite (for its great taste and uniqueness).
5;Vocalist says it is the best thing ever;I do a lot of singing at school and during the 2010 Fall & Christmas choral season a friend who is a professional vocalist recommended this to me before a big performance.  It is the best thing to hit my tea collection to date.
1;STALE Tasting!;"don't be fooled and misled by believing these chips are ""healthier"" or ""better for you"". Same fat grams and calorie content."
4;My mellow afternoon beverage;"This is one of my two ""afternoon"" black teas (the other being Twining's Afternoon Tea.) It isn't nearly bold enough for my morning palate."
2;Too Sweet;I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product).
5;So good!;"So, going through Starbucks one day, not wanting a coffee, I came across their ""Passion Shaken Tea."" I plunked down my money, and found the best drink I've had in a long time."
5;Great Deal, Great Product, but Confused About Auto-Ship Ordering;I put my OCD to efficient use in researching the best organic cat food at the best price and this is what I found, and with which I am utterly delighted, BUT for one thing (there's always a thing) -- when I signed up for this auto-ship service it stated that I would be able to change the frequency and duration of my auto-ship order at any time.<br /><br />I LOVE the auto-ship service as it saves 15% and you receive free shipping but I DON'T love doing errands.
5;Dr Oz recommended!;Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically).
5;Wonderful, delicate Rosemary flavor in a Bold Parmesan Crisp!;"Have tried both the Rosemary-flavored and the Italian Herb-flavored Parmesan Crisps.  Definitely prefer the Rosemary!  The Italian Herb-flavored variety is a little ""busier"" to my taste."
5;Yummy gluten free cereal;"It evens says ""snap,crackle,pop."" Not only is it delicious, but it is very filling."
5;Strong and delicious;We brew this and keep a pitcher in the fridge. It's great for iced coffee because it's very strong.
5;Great gum;I love this gum and it's hard to find in stores.  There's no sugar and no nutra sweet, just great taste and a chewing gum that's actually good for you.
3;Average queens new york  made Bagel;Yes, that is correct. This type of bagel sold through Amazon,  you could get in the local supermarkets in Queens, NY.
5;Altoids cool honey;I found these mints to seem more lemony than tasting like honey, but I like them even more because of that--that they taste unique compared to other mints. And they have that strong, cool aftertaste that's characteristic of Altoids.
5;Love Hemp!!;Love this stuff! I make hemp milk with it and use it as cereal. Found another site where I can get the 5lbs bag for a lower price.
1;Very Disappointed;The product doesn't look worth the price I paid for it
2;Not that great;"I am a a vegetarian, and this is my least favorite ""jerky"".  The texture is sort of slimey and after a couple bites, I had had enough."
4;The bags not contain only 8.1 ounces;Like the chips
4;Works well for 1 gallon compost pail;We bought these to work with our 1gallon stainless steel countertop pail, I was worried the size would be a problem, this is not the case we simpy fold the bag on the outside of the pail. we have something to grab and tie te bag when the pail is full.
1;Peach Cobbler mix;Calhoun Bend Mill - Peach Cobbler mix..
5;New Formula is fine, still Really helps my running!;Some people mentioned a Different Taste, and the inclusion of Stevia. This is a natural plant based Sweetener, and doesn't effect the taste for me at all.
3;Egg Protein;Although it is very high in protein, I thought the vanilla ice cream flavor was very bland. I would not buy this again as it was not tasty enough.
5;LOVE these chips!;I have been a long time seeker of junk food substitutes to help maintain my weight. I will never again, and I repeat, NEVER, buy another baked chip again.
5;My dogs love this!;I've found it difficult to find the 15lb bag at either Petco or Petsmart in Chicago. I've got two small dogs (shih tzu and hava-malt) who go through food pretty quickly so it was great to track the big bag down online and order it.
4;Not quite what I remember.;The product arrived in the condition as described by the seller and before the expected arrival date.  I thought I had these when I was younger and really liked them.
1;Stay away from this company;We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.
5;Great tasting & Nutritious;These hemp seed are very good tasting. They are kind of nutty yet buttery in the same sense.
5;I LOVE LOVE LOVE Choco Milk!!!;I grew up on Choco Milk.  My dad used to make a morning breakfast drink with milk, banana, egg, choco milk and ground cinnamon blended until smooth.
1;The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?;I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered.
5;This tastes good.  Try it.;There are several good recipes on the web for quinoa.  It is very mild tasting, and the texture is soft.
4;Actually really good snack bars;They seem to be very healthy and they are tasty as a snack bar.  My only negative is that whatever seeds are in the snack bar, should be ground prior to the mixing process.
5;Yummy!;These bars are more like candy then energy or nutrition bars. They do have a hefty amount of nuts and fruit though that sits atop a dark chocolate bed which is then drizzles with more yummy dark chocolate.
5;My cat won't eat anything else... that says it all! :);I received TWO (2) 24-pack boxes of this product
1;YUCK! NOT SWEET! NOT SWEET TEA --  Just light citrus flavor and hint of  tea. Do not expect any real tea flavor.;This is just plain awful. It tastes like you went to a self serve bar in buffet and filled you cup with 1 tea to 3 waters.
5;Can't get enough of these!!;Barbecue has to be the absolute BEST variety of Popchips.  (I've tried them all.
5;Nutiva -  Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 oz. solid;I have used a different brand of this product previously.  But had I not, it would be helpful to have information on what the product is beneficial for.
1;dented;These cans keep arriving dented even though the boxes they come in are fine.  I believe we are intentionally being sold dented cans without any type of disclosure.
5;Tea;This is the best tea to use for peach iced tea.  It has a good peach flavor that is fragant and tasty.
5;Hot and Wonderful!!!;Awesome stuff..
5;Great coffee, but the Hyper may just be hype;Probably just as strong as French roast Starbucks coffee, but you can't beat the price for the 3 pack.<br /><br />Works great in a drip maker or espresso pot.
5;THIS IS GREAT AND A GOOD DEAL!!;We use lots of pepper..
5;Tasty!;I just tried this mix for the first time today, as it took awhile for me to remember to buy buttermilk. It's quite tasty, but you can really taste the salt! I made it on my Villaware Belgian wafflemaker on setting 6, using 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup oil (recipe calls for 1/4 oil), and it came out dark-brown and crispy on outside and very moist on the inside - just delicious.
5;Good fuel...no more bonk;I discovered I had a Gluten allergy and had to switch from my former product (which I loved). Gu's Roctane works even better.
4;Good Taste but Expensive;I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.
4;Tastes ok, good for ya!;This tea was surprisingly hard to find at the health food store, so I bought it online. Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one.
5;useful at office;Works great to have at office (no refrigeration) to keep on desk to put in coffee and tea. (Much better tasting than powder creamer of course!) Although it is 1% milk, it reminds me a bit like evaporated milk in that it is a bit richer tasting, so it is just fine and not too watery for this purpose.
4;Very delicious;I was really surprise about the taste. It was very delicious.
5;Cats seem to love it;Overall I really like it.<br /><br />The container is fairly nice and between the tin and the bag it keeps the catnip very fresh.
5;exactly as described;The product arrived exactly as described. It was just what I wanted and they are delicious! If you like this product in the store you'll love them from this vendor.
5;Excellent!;These are perfect for when you'd like to have that chocolate chip cookie and you know you shouldn't.  Its crunch, crispy with just the right amount of chocolate chips to satisfy your craving.
4;This stuff is fabulous!!  You gotta try it!!;I first heard about this product on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network and ever since then I have always wanted to try it.  This stuff is great.
5;Good quality food ! My GSD loves it.;My Dog A Belgium Malinois- aka Belgium Sheppard loves the food.<br />The Austin German Sheppard rescue- where Dante came to Us from<br />told me is the best they recommend, Dante has been here with me<br />for over 2 yrs, healthy coat,runs and is a very happy dog.
3;Not as good as expected...;Gritty/ crystalized texture like I'm biting into sand at the beach. Too sweat.
5;Bouncy Bone a Big Hit;This Premier toy can be loaded with the Gnawhide treats (see my Gnawhide Treat review). We don't really play bounce with it
1;Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer;I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good.
5;Cats love them;Cats love them - both the chicken and salmon flavors.  They also offer a glucosamine chondroitin product (for cats with joint pain) that is much less expensive than some alternatives.
1;It made me fall asleep;I drank some to try and keep me awake for an essay, I fell asleep about 15 minutes after drinking it. I don't feel it did anything for me.
5;Very tasty;I love this item, the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor, rather than eating plain pork.  A butcher recommends this to his customers.
5;chocoholic heaven;I've ordered Yamate sugar free dark chocolate sweetened with maltitol for years now. My most recent order had samples of Coco Polo in it.
5;Love Love Love;The picky beagle absolutely loves these treats. I give them to her crumbled on her breakfast as well as individual treats throughout the day.
5;memorable!! .;i've brought all of the decades of candy, except for the 90's..
1;EW!!!;Oh my gosh, these are gross. I bought them because of Hungry Girl's glowing recommendation.
5;Tastes good;"I recently found out about these products and I love this breakfast sausages. I have tried the other product: <a href=""http://www."
5;Great with water or as a mixer.;Wonderful, delicious stuff.  Add to ice water for total refreshment.
5;The only review you'll ever need;Works as advertised. No balancing issues even if one side is full of kcups and the other side is bar.
5;Best flavor for Licorice lovers;I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.
5;KIND Bars = Yum;These are delicous and gluten free.  I found these at Starbucks.
5;GREAT!!!;My dog wouldn't eat the expensive stuff the vet sells (liver flavored).  In fact I had to grind it over his food and hope he would get enough glucosomine.
4;He likes it (and licks it) but sticky ball;Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.
2;Cats are obligate carnivores;Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal.
5;Great Product;I've recently switched my cats to all grain free food. (if you still feed your cats (or dogs!) with grain filled food, especially if you have had a problem with bladder or kidney stones, I implore you to look at the reviews and research of grain free food.
5;Beetlejuice is a greatmovie, but they cheated you on the dvd;Just to warn you. when in trying to trick you in the widescreen format, the company made a mistake by also including the full screen version with it.
1;hermits are nasty tasting.;these cookie are nasty. these are a cross between a fig newton and a bownie.
3;meh, just OK....;I think that it depends on whether you get fresh cans that were stored properly. Mine were sort of dry and tasteless.
5;Great product, Great Price;My 13 year old Lhasa makes the title Prima Dona seem tame.  She is so finicky, we're at wits end.
5;This is a great product;I was introduced to Robinson's Lemon Barley Water by a friend that grew up in the U.K.
3;Good deal but close expiration date!;I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.
5;Very Good Tasting Hot Drink Mix - Highly Recommended!;"Alpine Sugar Free Spiced Cider mix is a very good tasting hot drink mix that is perfect for those looking to cut calories and carbs. I am a Type 2 diabetic and am always happy when something tastes just as good as the regular version (my wife likes <a href=""http://www."
5;Wow!  ..A Scrumptious Exotic Treat!!;"I initially found these little gems under the ""manager's special"" section"
5;Must have for kids but go for on sale;I got these when they had a sale on amazon. So I got them for even less than the off-brands.
5;BON APPETIT WINE COUNTRY GIFT BASKET/AMAZON;I ORDERED THIS AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND RECEIVER WAS DELIGHTED WITH EVERYTHING.  WINE COUNTRY DELIVERY WAS FAST AND TRACKING WAS EASY.
4;Nice Price But Not Quite The Same Thing;The expensive Silver Needles White Tea comes from the Fujian region of China and has a very light and kind of grassy flavor.  If that's what you're looking for, this Tao of Tea product is not that.
4;healthy, happy snack;I wanted to really use the treats a few different times and such to make sure they didn't upset donny's stomach and be able to give a more detailed review. :) Thanks for sending me treats - Donny (and now Bella) love it.
5;keurig review;I bought this for my mom, a coffee addict, and she only has positive things to say about this flavor. I do, however, reccomend buying a variety unless, of course, you don't mind having 50 of one flavor.
5;Love them. Yummy combination of flavors;Cocoa and a little spice. Well, might be a ,little too spicy for some.
5;Very Good Iced tea too;I did not like any of the brew over iced tea flavors so i tried this and love it.  Would definately recommend for iced or hot tea.
5;Long lasting and tasty;This product is moderately expensive (for salt) but I got a jar and it has lasted for several months. Just a little goes a long way.
5;great stuff;Tastes great. Seems to have slightly less fizz than a regular soda, but with none of the harmfull stuff.
4;Great for Gluten Free and No White Sugar;I have Celiac Disease, and I try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum, and I was suprised by how good these are! The light crunch is a shock at first, but is tasty. It is a tad dry, so I am only giving 4 stars.
5;love it;I've only tried a few different brands. But I keep coming back to Lucid.
2;Too many broken cups!!!;I was so excited to see that I could get flavored coffee creamer cups in bulk. They came in the mail at a decent time, but I have thrown out way too many broken cups that have leaked all over the other cups.
5;Price gouging at its best;This item sells in supermarkets for only 5.99 and you got it listed for how much.
5;My fussy Min. Dachshund loves the taste!;I just ordered this, came today and thought I would just try it, well to my amazement,My little Daisy ate it and wanted more.My little Dog is just 8 yrs but has trouble with Flare-ups with her pancreas, I have to avoid fats and corn with her and she needs more fiber.
5;Yum!;I have tried several flavors of Larabar and I like them all well enough, but the Ginger Snap is my absolute favorite. It is delicious and satisfying.
3;Does Not Contain Crack Cocaine, Just Seems That Way;These cookies have one small flaw that makes it difficult to give them five stars, they are almost literally addictive.  If you open a package of these cookies and do not eat them all at once, then I bet we can count the hours they will last.
5;THE BEST COFFEE ON THE MARKET;THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE COFFEE, IN THE U.S.
2;OK;I LOVE reg click and love vanilla but was very very disappointed in with this one.Right now I'm just trying yo use it up by adding a little into my reg Click.
5;Great Coffee!!;This is my everday coffee and I love it. Add a little non-fat creamer and a splenda.
3;Interesting crust--very sweet & light underneath;"I got mine at a local co-op for about half this price.  The ""crust"" of pollen, propolis, and beeswax is interesting stuff--kind of funky."
5;the best by far;after my daughter was born she was put on the similac advantage. she did okay for a week and then had violent gas pains.
5;Yummy!;Bought these with two other items from this seller.  Decided to treat myself to a little something sweet this holiday season.
5;Another great dog treat!;My dog is not the most discriminating when it comes to edible (or not) goodies.  Just about everything is good, but  'some treats are more good than others'.
4;tastes like real coffee but I don't like the smell;I feel good when I drink that herbal coffee,I'm not getting nervous like when I drink real coffee.It is good for every time of the day even the evening.
2;Disappointed;I also had a problem with it bursting all over.  I thought it had an artificial flavor and left an aftertaste.
5;HOTTEST I'VE EVER FOUND;I bought this for my roommate as a Christmas gift. He eats Dave's Insanity Sauce (black label) on EVERYTHING (including his breakfast cereal) in large quantities (more than a table spoon for a small sandwich) and says he longer feels a burn from it.
5;Don't let the malt scare you - wonderful mix !!;If you are expecting your waffles to taste like a malted milk ball then this is not the mix for you.  I dislike malt but LOVE this mix!<br /><br />It's super easy - container says add water, egg & butter.
4;Premium Gum - Good For Your teeth;I like orange flavor that is why I prefer this new Citrusmint from Orbit. Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two everytime.
5;Tastes good and the caffeine content serves a purpose...;I've been drinking this coffee for a few months now and it's not my first choice in terms of taste but it still tastes good and it's helped lower my caffeine intake which is what I am mainly concerned with.  I switched to this coffee after I found out I was pregnant and was told to have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day.
5;good stuff;I received the product quickly and it was fresh.  I am not sure there is much more to comment about the product other than those two items.
5;Delicious;These are my husband's favorite drinks.  They are low calorie and taste sweet (but not too sweet) with carbonation.
5;Our pet loves greenies;Our pet loves having greenies as treat, she gets crazy every time she hears or see us opening the package. Her breath also gets better after eating her treat.
5;Gin Gins Hard Ginger Candy;I found this product when I looked through a search engine to find natural ginger. I was taking a medication, that made me very sick to my stomache.
1;Want a red mess on your carpet?;My dog got an hour's pleasure out of a single bone. Thankfully she ate it on a towel that happened to be on the floor.
5;My cat is addicted!!!!!  lol;My 13 year old cat wants to skip meals..
1;BEWARE HIGH FLUORIDE;"FROM PFPC, the premiere fluoride information site:<br /><br />Over the last few years a new scam has emerged in Europe which is rapidly spreading across the world.<br /><br />It involves ordinary rock salt from the ""salt range"" in Pakistan being marketed as luxurious and healing ""Himalaya Salt""."
5;A nice option to olive oil and butter for cooking;We like organic coconut oil for some cooking uses, and I like being able to get it from Amazon (subscribe & save) rather than a separate site with separate shipping & handling. It's a good value and a good product.
5;INSURANCE WILL PAY for hypoallergenic formula!!;Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician.
5;Orgain Or Bust.;Orgain is delicious, all natural, organic and full of vitamins and minerals. Light tasting, it goes down easy and gives a nice does of protein and a bit of fiber.
1;Don't waist your time or money;"The bag should have been labeled ""Mice Ears"".  There wasn't a decent sized ear in the bag."
4;Great Classic Cookies;When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go.
5;Libby is quality product, and this was the best way to order;we ordered 2 cases because they were on sale, cheaper than local stores have been (Pumpkin shortage raised prices big-time). we did get a couple of dented cans, but I don't see how that can be avoided.
3;Good  - but beware - labelled incorrectly as dimmable on Amazon;"These lamps were at first look very good & bright as well as energy efficient<br />(I remember my old man would only use 25w light bulbs when we were kids as ""they saved energy and money"" - little did I know he was predicting a future path we needed to take so the hole in the ozone layer wasn't bigger than Australia)<br />Unfortunately I bought these for the purpose of using them in dimmable fixtures - to allow situation lighting as well as energy efficiency and reducing my carbon footprint.  They are labelled as dimmable on Amazon (still are as at date of this review!) and are in fact not - and as such they cannot be used in dimmable circuits without risk of fire or early failure (fire according to info I have read)."
5;Great product!!!;I was told by a friend to try this tea since I was going to be having twins. It has definitely been working for me.
3;Nice smell...;Smells really nice.  I wish it tastes somewhat as strong as it smells, but the flavor is very mild.
5;The BEST Hot Sauce;I found this hot sauce while honeymooning in St. Lucia.
5;Love it!!!;This is the first and only iced tea I have purchase since owning my brewer for the past year.  I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.
4;Quick Disappearing Bone;My dog chewed it up & made it disappear in about 5 minutes, while I was emptying the box. He definitely likes it but its a little costly to go so fast.
1;product GREAT - jump in shipping charge CRAZY!;Love this product.  recently moved to rural area & loved getting my rice milk delivered to my door (3 cases of 64oz organic / order) for our family of 6 -- we all love our RICE DREAM.
5;Really good coffee;This sampler pack of Arbuckles gourmet coffee was a great gift.  I tried one of each coffee sample and they are really good.
5;chai Latte at home;This is as good as the restaurant stuff!  Consistently great because it is pre-measured.  Easy to take with you.
5;Just what the doctor ordered!;We have a 15lb, soon to be 9 year old, chihuahua, dachshund mix who is by no means a chewer but he is an OCD licker. He primarily licks his paws and he also has a slightly elongated soft palette so he often just licks the air if you will.
5;A must have in my collection;My husband and I have become K-cup addicts since I bought him the machine for Christmas. This is my favorite flavor so far.
5;Great for sports;I play football competitively and during our training camps, we, of course, had three-a-days (three practices per day). I would take one (or even half) before each practice and I was much more energized even with less sleep.
3;Tastes vaguely like Apricots;Couldnt compare to Looza in flavor. Was watery and sugary tasting.
5;What a treat!;What a treat! It's like eating candy, peanut butter and an Oreo cookie all rolled into one.<br /><br />They are the same Oreo cookie bottom but with creamy rich peanut butter in the middle and a great tasting chocolate covering.
5;Soooo Yummy!;These noodles and the flavor are out of sight!  I just love them.  I add 1 squirt of Sri Ratcha sauce and it is just a fantastic snack.
5;For the Cuban-style espresso (finely ground, dark roasted) - this is it;If you enjoy darker, richer, full-flavored espresso - look no further. This is it.
5;Great product;I have dry skin and wanted a good thick cream to use at night. This cream feels good without being too thick or greasy.
5;Love It!;I usually prefer lighter and milder blends for my Keurig coffee maker, but I really love the Kona! It's medium bodied and not bitter AT ALL which I don't like about darker blends. I'll continue to keep the Tully's Kona on hand.
5;Rose extract to add a floral note to tea, coffee, etc.;This can add a floral note to tea, coffee, etc. and brighten up your day.
5;Blooming Tea;This was given as a gift. My sister had never tried Blooming Tea and love it.
1;not in jelly at all as stated on package;My 4 cats all refused to touch this. It is not in jelly, it is in some kind of sauce and was a complete waste of money as not one of my cats will eat it.
5;Makes for the best popcorn EVER!!!;Ok so I bought this product because I have been really wanting to make movie theater style popcorn at home for a while now.  At first I started making popcorn without knowing or reading up on anything, so I bought an electronic popcorn popper and just tried making popcorn with cooking oil.
4;Tasty;The fruit cake is very tasty and pricy (as all the good ones are). Glad I found it.
5;Yummy!;I just tried popchips for the first time and they were great!  I immediately went online to find them and order more.  Only 100 calories in the .
5;Not your average flavored coffee!;"I am not a fan of flavored coffees but ""raspberry chocolate truffle""?  Oh yeah!  It is very good and a little decadent.  I don't normally add anything to coffee but for this one I added just a touch of sugar to enhance the chocolate flavor."
5;Salt & Pepper Popchips - I crave these!;If you like hot peppery spicey food (and drink), you will like these.  I get a craving for them.
5;Love this chutney sauce!;This chutney sauce is perfect - exactly the flavor I expect when I go to an Indian restaurant. I bought some so I could get that same taste at home.
4;straws kinda suck;it's milk.  no big deal.
5;Great product, great value;"I was simply looking for a tuna product that does not contain ""vegetable broth"" when I discovered I could have that AND low mercury, low environmental impact tuna too.<br /><br />This tuna tastes better than any of the canned stuff (with or without broth) that I was buying at the local supermarket."
5;Coffee Purchase;Fabulous. fabulous, fabulous.
5;OMG, this is a heavenly snack.;Just tried this and it's my new favorite indulgence. The smoky chipotle flavor gives a rich subtle heat, the caramel is just the right sweetness (not sickenly sweet like other brands), and the crisp fresh crunch of the almonds all together make this snack a gourmet experience.
4;Celtic sea;Nice Flavor if you do not want things boring.  I have purchased other sea salts that were much more expensive, but I genuinely prefer this.
4;They lovbe it;They LOVE it, I give my kitties (Silki and Tuffy) half a pouch each as a mid day snack to keep thier bird terrorizing energy level up.I gave it 4 stars only because it's a little messy to tear open sometimes, and I don't use scissors because you have to clean them afterwards.
5;Great Oatmeal;I've had Silver Palate Oatmeal prior to this purchase and it is wonderful.  It takes longer to cook than other types (Instant or Quick), but the taste and texture are worth it.
4;Tasty and economical, wish it was lower sodium;I used to use the organic vegetable broth cartons but was looking for a lower sodium alternative.  Sodium is better then what I had been using, not ideal, and I like the flavor.
5;Kid Favorite;My children loves these quick fun little goldfish snacks. The quantity lasts my family of six for a good period of time.
5;Happy Tummy!;I love that HAPPYBABY has added DHA and probiotics into their cereal.  We used the cereal for my daughter and have mixed it with breast milk, water, and baby food purees.
5;I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.;If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.
5;Great popcorn;Glad I didn't listen to some of the bad reviews for this popcorn. We have a home version of the movie theatre machine that pops corn with oil.
4;Good deal;I believe that most reviewers usually balance out a product, with the naysayers usually spouting out more negative things that those happy campers.  I was a happy camper with this bag of coffee cups.
2;NASTY!!;I will never understand why they put Splenda into non-diet drinks but I can tell you that it was a horrible idea. So diet is undrinkable and so is regular.
4;Goji Gold;I decided to try the Goji juice on recommendation of a few people. I have tried it before, but with no regularity, so this time, I decided that I'd give this supplement a real trial.
5;So far the only cereal I eat;I've been eating this cereal for probably around 2 years and I plan on continuing to use this product.  One of these days I should try some of their other cereals but just haven't gotten around to it.
5;Long lasting lip balm;I've been using blistex for decades, burts bees for years and I just found this in the organic section at wal mart.  I like coconut and decided to give this a try.
3;its ok;i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day.
5;best coffee ever;i luv, luv, luv this coffee. too bad it's only a seasonal flavor or i would have it on autoship.
5;Good Food from Amazon;My kitties and I love this catfood. Had some problems with the boy kitty after neutering and he went off his food for over a week.
5;Mouth-watery cookies!;I bought these cookies as gifts. Once they are open, they don't last very long at all.
2;not as flavorful;The longer i receive the timothy espresso coffee decaf. the weaker it gets.
4;More good hair days;I love the way this shampoo makes my scalp and hair feel.  My hair feels fuller, bouncier (is that a word) and my scalp isn't as itchy.
5;Excellent!;These chocolate-covered cashews are excellent and the shipping was on time.  They are large and have great flavor.
5;Best Ramen Ever;Although, I understand that the Goreng part of the name means noodles without broth, I'll never stop calling this ramen (meaning noodles with broth). The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious.
3;An Aquired Taste;This is a decent product, but I have a lot of texture issues.  The flavor is light and buttery, but not as sweet as I expected.
5;Excellent, Strong Keurig Coffee!;"I've not been a fan of the Keurig coffee, due to the weak nature of the brew.  ""Strong"" setting just doesn't get it."
5;YUMM YUMM TASTY!!!;I love to do bodybuilding<br /><br />so my diet is very restricted..
5;Tone's granulated garlic;I am pleased with this product. The container is perfect with shaker or spoon openings in the lid.
5;Yum;I came across these granola bars as part of the Subscribe & Save program.  Much to my dismay, the subscription service option was discontinued.
5;Gluten-free and tasty;This is a tasty cereal.  My husband must have gluten free products and has been eating this for 5+ years.
4;If You Are Wondering???;Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.
1;Who knows what it is!;The good news is dogs like it.  Too bad it's made in China with no regulations!!!!!  So you will never know what's really in it.
5;In love with coconut water!;I am in love with coconut water, especially now that I am trying the flavored Zico. Passion fruit is nice and clean, mango was delicious.
5;Great Food;Love the price and the number of boxes you get. 4 boxes for around $5-6 is bargain price.
3;A candy favorite;The candy bar itself is one of my favorites. Has all the items that I would want in a bar except I would prefer dark chocolate to the milk chocolate.
5;Yummies for my doggie...;My yorkie loves these, we were first introduced to these at xmas by my sister-in-law and have had a terrible time finding these here in NY. Once in a while I can find these at an end-cap at Dollar General but that's about it so I'm very happy to find these on-line and they are the right size too, about the size of a quarter.
5;Awesome treat that keeps your dog's teeth clean;I used to buy these for my dog from the vet
5;Excellent Service;I was very excited to find this product as I had previously purchased it at a store in San Francisco and had trouble finding more elsewhere. I already knew the mustard would taste great, but what came as an awesome surprise was how fast it shipped.
5;Distance Runner in Love!;As a marathon runner and lover of long distance, I've found my match. Lemon-lime Jelly Belly Sport Beans are really one of the best electrolyte products.
1;nasty;I really liked the idea of having one handy kit to make a curry dinner.  I found this kit to be quite gross.
2;Figs are figs.;I can get fresher figs right here in America.  Still, they were good.
4;Pretty good tea;It's no premium Kukicha, but it's pretty good.  I steep it with boiling water until it cools, then I remove the bag.
4;Libby's Cut Asparagus Spears;These are good canned asparagus.  I used to get canned asparagus at my local Walmart, but they stopped selling them!  The price on Amazon with Subscription is a nice price and I love that they get shipped to me.
1;not really;I was really hoping this would be good.  Unfortunately it is not.
5;Effective and tasty;I've used the Gu energy gels for a while and have been happy with them. The flavor is tasty and it's nice that there's a little bit of caffeine for a kick during my long runs.
5;Good stuff!;This is good stuff.  I've always liked tea and I have a bit of a sweet tooth.
5;my number one choice for salad dressing;For years the only reason I'd never eat a salad is because of this particular flavor- Robusto Italian dressing with JUST the right amount of zest.  I'd especially make sure to cover up the brown lettuce with this type of salad dressing because I used to strongly dislike the brown part from a head of lettuce.
5;nuttzo peanut butter;This was on the Dr. Oz show, so I thought I would try it.
5;So Long Overpriced Coffee Drinks!;I love those Starbucks and McDonalds iced mochas, but they are so expensive!  I decided to give this a try and the rich, delicious mochas you can make at home with this syrup are, in my opinion, better than the ones you can buy out.<br /><br />Get some strong coffee, milk, whipped cream, and a couple of tablespoons of this syrup and you'll be good to go!  Delicious hot or iced.
5;Dogs LOVE these treats;Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Dog treats are delicious! Well, at least my dog thinks so. A great training aid.
5;Plant was in great shape;I had read the reviews and knew it would be small, it does say Bonsai, so that was what I expected. The plant arrived very quickly and it was in great shape.
5;Love these!;I was hesitant to purchase this at first because I thought it might turn out too thick and taste nasty. But I decided for a few dollars, it was worth giving it a shot.
5;My Favorite Bar of All;I saw this amazing combination in a healthy bar at Starbucks.  I am a mango fanatic so ANYTHING with mangoes rule!  I was not disappointed!  Mangoes, Macadamia nuts and coconut in 1 bar?  Heaven!  I turned on several of my co-workers to these and plus they have folate and calcuim, which were not in the bars prior.
1;Contains SPLENDA - yuck;"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this."
5;Not available in stores;Used to get this all the time but can no longer find it in grocery stores. Use it on all poultry and some sea food.
2;Not a sweet deal;Try the packets instead ..
5;My Kitty Seems To Love It;I don't know how I could say whether or not the cat food is tasty, but my kitty seems to like it.  My vet recommends this particular brand of food, so that's good enough for me.
1;echhhhhhhhh;I am anxious to find salted/cheese flavored snacks..
4;Well-rounded but weak;I've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of K-cups..
5;Hooked on this!;I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.
2;Where's the coconut?;This tea tastes more like spiced tea rather than coconut.  Try CS vanilla maple if you crave an excellent tea.
1;Expensive and dogs don't like it;Based on the Amazon reviews I purchased 2 of these for my 2 shih tzu's.  They sniffed if for a couple of minutes and then walked away from it.
5;So Good, My Family Can't Tell the Difference!;I love this pasta! It opens up a whole new range of food ideas while on a low carb diet..
3;Not Bad, but Not Great;I've been a coffee user to the point of roasting my own coffee beans for over a decade now, so I know good coffee.  I was a bit disappointed to see this product is made by Sara Lee (says so in very small print on the label).
5;It's black peppercorns;The quality is what you'd expect.<br />The nice thing about this item is the price.
4;Fresh ginger & mellow lemon;This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant.  It tastes to me like good real lemon, but not acidic.
5;Excellent;Being a Shredded Wheat fan since the 50's I tried this brand a year ago..
2;Tastes just like any other common honey you might eat;The description of this honey says it has a rich unique flavor. Mine certainly didn't.
5;Cat loves it!;When I adopted my cat they were feeding her science diet cat food. I kept her on that for only about 2 more weeks after before she was starting to refuse to eat the food and would go for my other cat's food that wasn't science diet.
1;NOT PLEASED;the product arrived brown and dying and infested with some kind of bug.  I followed directions, looked up on line, talked to people.
5;Great tasting coffee!;I love Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee for Keurig K-cups. It really has the taste of butter toffee and is not bitter.
5;Ariba Haribo!;I love Haribo grapefruit candies and have paid through the nose for them for many years.  This is the best grapefruit candy at the best price.
5;Excellent Pickled sausage;Totally happy with the Jack Links Screamin Demon.  The blend of great flavor and some pretty nice heat is a winner in my book.
2;A spicy little shell game!;This Zamouri berbere spice that i received did NOT have the same list of ingredients that are listed here for their Berbere. It contains no chili peppers even though Berbere should contain five (5) different peppers
5;My dog says Thank You;I always have these rawhide rolls in my house. My dog enjoys them and they last a long time.
1;Extremely disappointing - chips were made in 2007 and the oil in them was rancid;I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me.
4;Just Right for Me;As I've gotten older, I find that really strong coffee just doesn't agree with me any more.  I've searched for a milder blend that would work for me in the morning on an empty stomach.
5;Glad to find it;I have looked locally for this product. My family used to ship it to me from Germany.
5;Great Toy to get dogs thinking!;I have two rat terriers, and they did not understand instantly what they had to do.  They actually had to think and use their powers of deductive reasoning to figure out how to get to the treats.
2;Where's the chicken ?;I bought this stew a few days ago because I remebered how good it was when I was a kid, i.e, big chunks of chicken, big carrots and potatoes, and delicious flavor.
1;Green tea;I tried this green tea did not like it at all. I normally drink green tea but I found it to be kind of bitter.
5;Delicous!;"These were the hit of the ""Full Irish Breakfast"" my family had last St. Patrick's day."
4;Great Long Term Storage Snack;Good tasting bread. If you toast it and add cream cheeze then its hard to stop at one slice.
4;Gluten Free, Kosher and more;I have to eat gluten free, and a lot of snacks are just not very tasty.  These are excellent tasting, and the ingredients are some of the best foods you can eat.
5;Great smooth cheesy taste!!!;These were advertised as a pack of 4, but they were just one big box.  I am not sure getting the from Amazon is the best idea because they were pretty well smashed up by the time we got them.
5;affordable!;My husband thought I was crazy for ordering cereal from amazon. But much to his surprise this came packaged very well, with a shelf life of almost a year on it and was much cheaper than buying it from a grocery store.
4;Better than Cafe Bustelo;I make espresso on a Krups machine with Cafe Lavazza. In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.
5;Not a box of crap;My father in law tells my daughter that cereal is a box if crap.  This cereal is not!  It's one we all love and I buy it by the case.
1;Horrible pepper;This pepper was so old it made all my food taste like I put in ground chalk. All of the spices from this seller were old and useless.
5;Awesome snack;If you're looking for an excellent healthy snack, look no further. Buy the variety pack so you don't get sick of one type.
5;Great Summer Treat;I'm so glad to find this on Amazon. I've been buying it from the mall (30 min.
3;Not was i expected;I ordered this bamboo plant for my boyfriend as a lil surprise gift, so he didnt kno that he'll get it.<br />The shipping was pretty fast, but the vase is not dark blue.
2;Good Going In, Bad Coming Out;After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried.
5;It has SUGAR added as well as SALT;This is a good product IF you like sugar and salt in your peanut butter.  I like plain old peanut flavor in my peanut butter, so I have a choice to make:  either the oil from Smuckers or the sugar and salt from PB2.
5;Always fresh!;These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work.
3;Good taste, but difficult to get out of package;I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.
5;Slightly pink in color, but salt non-the-less.;Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff.
2;Season so bad that I washed them;The sugar salt combo season is so bad that I soaked them in water, washed out the canister and air dried them. Then and only then were they tasty.
5;Very Durable;This is a great toy for heavy chewers. I have a pit bull mix who has played with this toy for over a month now, and it is still in good condition.
2;Not loving it;I was so excited to find this Low-Carb Baking Mix and I thought that it would be of the same quality as all the other Bob's Red Mill products I've used.  Unfortunately that is not the case.
2;Trapped 1 fly in one month;Put the trap right where the flies were, but it only caught  1 fly in one month while the other flies hovered around.  It was easy to set up though.
4;A viable alternative;I gave up caffeine 6 months ago and it was only possible because of traditional rooibos
5;Perfect Tree;Not to long I receive my tree. I was surprise the tree I received is beautiful and strong.
1;Don't waste your money or your Keurig on this!;"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup."
3;It's ok, but I've had better drugstore chocolate;Smooth and creamy with nice toffee bits but only pulverized specks of almonds. I was duped into purchasing this (original logo said I'd be getting a 12 pack.
5;Best I could find for quality protein and grain free.;We had a 16 yr old tortie that developed an extreme vomiting problem.  I began to research and found that this can be caused by allergies to corn and various other grain products.
4;Nice after meals.;I bought Spry spearmint gum because I hoped it would help me get rid of sugar cravings.  It hasn't worked too well for me.
1;Five Star Movie, No Star DVD;This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.<br /><br />Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing.
5;Yummy!;We found this product to be suitable for someone in a hurry with not much time to cook, but still wanting a nutritious meal. After cooking it was not watery and had a very good consistency.
4;nice;i have bought 3 total , 1 for myself and 2 for family members. it comes in good shape and is sturdy because it is bamboo.
4;Seems to be a Healthy dry food.;I just recently moved back in with my parents. My little one is still a puppy and on puppy food, I tested it out on my parents dogs which are both adults.
5;Great Northern popcorn portion packs;The great Northern popcorn popper we use these in seems to be used almost daily, since we have 8 and 10 year old girls, and their friends, who are always wanting a snack (specially after school). Although we also use the separate corn and oil also, the packs are just as good tasting, and sometimes a little handier when in a hurry, or out of the separate ingredients.
5;All time favorite!;I have been enjoying PG tips for more than a decade. I first encountered it when I was in England.
5;cesar canin dog food lamb flavor;I beleive this product may becoming discontnued and it is the only dog food my finicky bassett hounmd will eat.<br />Love the proce and my dog loves the taste.
5;My Favorite Torilla Chips;I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life.
1;Not gluten free;Since Amazon did not give the list of ingredients, I had to search the web. Found the manufacturer's website [.
3;No vanilla flavor;I've been searching far and wide for a good vanilla tea so I decided to try this one. I must say, I'm disappointed yet again.
5;Delicious and Healthy;I buy these for the whole family.  Coconut Cream Pie is our favorite flavor.
5;Very Good Tea;I ordered this tea for my office. I had requests for Mint Tea and Green Tea - so why not combine the requests, right? I have to say, I've had nothing but compliments.
5;Delicious;A generous assortment of dark chocolates
4;Amazing smell, good flavor;It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.
4;Olives good, packaging not!;I ordered the black tubs of olives in the past from Roland, glad I still had an empty left to put my new ones in.  The bag doesn't travel well!  The olives in the bag were almost all misshapened, flat, some even squished.
5;Fantastic Food Veg;I first tried this product when sold in my grocery store, it was wonderful. Of course when I go back to purchase more, they had stopped selling the product so I had to find it.
5;Great product;The cat loves the taste and I mean really loves the taste. She gets excited just seeing the package.
5;Kitties LOVE these!;One of my cats is going through chemotherapy and sometimes wants nothing to do with her normal food.  But she has NEVER turned down these treats!  And even when she doesn't eat much else, I'm happy knowing this is simply chicken, nothing more.
1;Expiration time less than one week.;The expiration date was less than one week after it arrived. I wish I knew this before I ordered two as my kid only needs 1/2 of one a week.
5;Great product and service;Received this product much sooner than promised. Seeds grow as claimed and plant is great.
5;Really sweet and so good for you!;I love Coconut juice and this is one of the best on the market. I tried a case last month and am reordering.
4;Excellent Lo-Cal Beverage;This is quite a good product
5;Smells INCREDIBLE while brewing... tastes good too;I would honestly just make cup after cup of this stuff, so it would make my apartment smell like heaven.  I didn't purchase mine from Amazon (they were cheaper on other sites), but I thought I'd share-- if you like the smell of butterscotch, or the taste of butter pecan ice cream, just stand around your Keurig and sniff while brewing this flavored coffee gem.
3;Good taste, but nothing special;The pH of this water is supposed to lead to health benefits, according to the bottle.  I sampled one bottle, drinking it over the course of the day, and while I can't say I noticed any difference in my health, I'm not sure how many bottles it would take to notice the results promised.
1;Product not sealed;This product arrived and I found it a little odd that a liquid food product such as this is not encased in a cellophane shrink wrapping.  Then I opened the top and found that there was not even a seal across the top of the bottle.
4;I know nothing about these except that I like the taste.;Before I opened the package, I started wondering if they had actually been cleaned before they were packaged.  After opening them, I still wasn't sure, so I rinsed off a small amount and let them dry.
5;Cindi O;This product is great if you are looking for low carb..
5;My daughter loves it...;This is certainly one of the best products from Gerber of all the ones I have used till now and I have used quite a few of them. My daughter is 10 months old and she totally loves it :) They dissolve easily in the mouth and thats the best thing about them.
5;Best gourmet raw chocolate bar;I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand.
5;My View;I love strawberry flavor instant breakfast and cant find it in any local grocery store. Glad to find it online.
3;Good, but............;They taste GREAT but the packaging sucks!  I can count on one hand the number of packages that were NOT opened, even a tiny bit.  As I don't eat them every day, I only recently discovered the problem.
5;One of my favorite Japanese treats...I made the mistake of sharing at work;and now I have to buy more.  Nice bite sized morsels with a real matcha style green tea flavor--if you have ever had the real thing you can recognize the flavor in the candy.
1;smoker bags - alder;This was represented as 3 bags and was only one.  I could have bought one bag at 1/3 of the price elsewhere.
5;Good Coffee!;This is good coffee! As soon as the Marley Coffee arrived I brewed up a mug of the elixir, added only real cream, and sat back to see how it went. And it went well! I like my coffee strong, and although this is a medium bodied brew, it can be brewed to be stouter if you have the right coffee maker.
5;Fabulous New Product from Peeled Snacks;We have been fans of the PEELED SNACKS product line for years now. We love their line of organic dried fruits.
4;This is my second package...;yeah..
5;Fantastic!;I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo.
4;Like it very much;I use this to make a two-cup. It is a full flavored, full bodied mint tea.
5;Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, French VanillaI;I am very pleased with this product..
1;Somewhat Bitter - this company offers better products - I'd pass on this one;The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better.
1;Yuck!;I bought these based on their high review.  What a total waste of my money!  I thought they were disgusting and tried to feed one to my 6 year old who also turned up her nose to them.
5;Badia food coloring;Normally I like this product, but I haven't received it yet. I will have to contact company asap.
4;Good cooffee;This coffee is expensive but it pretty much lives up to its price. I'd like to (and will soon) compare it to the dark Peruvian I just purchased and am waiting to receive.
5;Montana in a Bottle;Straight up, I'm not a whiskey aficionado. I try a little of everything, enjoying the occasional surprise.
5;Delicious!;This is one of my favorite flavors,however I like the natural and chocolate flavors also. Very refreshing all year long! Love to send it to my family members who are in college.
3;Too many branding and packaging changes;"This has been my favorite International Coffee beverage since General Foods introduced it. I use to purchase a pack of 6 cans every other month through Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"" until I was notified that it would no longer be available."
4;Coconut Oil capsules;"Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL ""good"" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them."
1;My cats hated this food;Both of my cats hated this food--they refused to eat it. My male cat will eat almost literally anything (paper, hair, bugs.
5;No blood glucose increase;Hi,<br />You should try the Zero carb FlavorRich version. This version has a pleasant flavor and you can be confident you are having a legitimate low carb product.
4;Corazonas Oatmeal Squares Chocolate Brownie & Almond;I eat one of these cookies for breakfast, they are very good. They have helped me with my weight loss.
5;My new favorite low-carb snack! :-9;If you love sushi, you'll also love these seaweed snacks.  They are my new favorite low-carb snack, and perfect for when I feel like munching on something (like when I'm watching a movie).
5;Delicious!;It tasted great!  This is something I would eat daily even if it wasn't good for me.  The flavor is like no other.
5;AeroGarden Italian Herb Seed Kit;The product is everything it claims to be. We were able to begin harvesting most of the herbs within 4 weeks and we were able to continue harvesting them for close to 6 months.
1;Yuck!;These were the sweetest tasting, icky, sticky fruit twisters.  My son is addicted to candies and I thought these would remind him of fruit roll ups.
4;Yummy;I was very surprised by the quality and flavor of the dark chocolate. It is better than most of the chocolate bars I've picked up at a specialty chocolate shop.
5;Delicious hot or cold, a Peachy-Mangosteen delight;Lipton Teas just get better! With Green Tea Superfruit white Mangosteen with Peach, you can enjoy the healthy effects of green tea, married with a luscious peach and mangosteen fruity flavor. I enjoy this tea even without sugar, the mangosteen adds a terrific depth to the peachy bouquet.
5;perfect taste and energy;These taste like high quality m&ms with a strong hint of coffee. The coffee taste is not at all overpowering which I love because I am not the biggest coffee fan.
5;Great Tea Box;I bought this tea box for my sister's engagement party a few weeks ago. She had over a hundred people so all the tea was gone before we knew it.
1;Real coffee???;"I bought a box of Grove Square ""medium roast"" for $10.00."
4;needs more flavor;I use the cups on a lower cup level.  I make a smaller cup of this to get more flavor.
4;crunchy goodness;For a store bought cookie, these are good.  Very crunchy and a good flavor.
5;Pink Sprinkles;Exactly what I thought it would be. ALOT (more then I will ever need) of pink sprinkles, that taste like.
1;Mrs. Bridges Plum Chutney EXPIRED!!!;I received three jars of Mrs. Bridges Plum Chutney with Ale on September 5, 2012.
5;Easy to use Curry paste;I have a hard time finding Yellow curry paste and this one worked great. It's super easy to use with alot of robust flavor.
5;Delicious!;"These might be the best chips I have ever had.  The ""Used By"" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open."
2;didn't work for me;I have a lot of fine, wavy, dark hair, and this product didn't seem to do much for me. I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer.
1;wrong flavor;Yes, also bought this at the local drugstore and discovered it tastes nothing like ranch.I thought they might have put the wrong crackers into the ranch labeled container.
5;Got Milk?;My nephew is a chocolate milk freak!!  I bought him this for Christmas and he's a happy, happy guy.  The large container will last him a while.
1;smelled & tasted burnt;My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.
5;Wonderful Flavor and Crunchiness;"I was so surprised to read the previous review of these ""delicious cashews.Our experience was quite the opposite."
5;TOP QUALITY CATNIP!;This catnip was a tremendous hit with all of my cats! Nice chunky buds on the stems that my cats seem to prefer to the powdered catnip. Good packaging and I'll definitely be ordering this product again.
5;Lower salt.......yehhhhhh!;I love Ramen chicken noodle soup but it was always way too salty to eat more than once a week.  With the decreased salt content in this packaged soup, I can eat it more often.
5;A Great, Flavorful Cookie;I have never tried any of the Newman's Own products, but had heard the products from this label were of high quality.  I was therefore eager to try Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps.
3;Not that tasty alone, but with add-ins it's useful to keep around;There's an after-taste I can't quite recognize and don't quite like when I try to heat just a plate of this Vegetable Pulao by itself, but when I heat it up with additional vegetables (especially nice green frozen peas, since the peas in any of these ready-to-eat entrees are inevitably faded to gray by the time they're re-heated, and it's the work of a few minutes to chop up fresh carrots, bell peppers, garlic, broccoli, or whatever else you have on hand, to mix in before microwaving) and throw in a few additional cashews, it's much better.  It's better still with a nice, spicy stir-fry or heat-and-eat curry served over top.
4;real tea;The Irish breakfast blend is the best Twinings product. I drink at least four mugs a day.
5;Another great tea from Earth Mama Angel Baby;I love Earth Mama Angel Baby teas.  They have a chart on their boxes telling you if they're safe for nursing and/or expecting mothers.
5;get naked!!;I travel a lot and am always on the lookout for healthy snacks I can take along with me.  This granola is exactly what I like.
5;Fantastic chips! The best ever!;Seriously the best tortilla chips - or chips of any kind I have ever had.  Plus they have the added benefit of being nutritious.
1;Not for sprouting.;If you want to put this bag, single layer, over the mouth of a Mason jar for use in sprouting seeds it will not work well. The mesh is too fine to let water drain from the jar unless you can wait for a half hour or so.
3;Not a mindless snack!;Corn Nuts are delicious, enjoyable and addictive. However, I have TWICE broken teeth with them, including today.
5;Happy dog, happy customer;My dog goes crazy for these. He won't touch the Virbac dog chews.
5;Yogi Bedtime Tea Bags;This is the first bedtime tea I've tried.  I'm not much of a tea conossuier of any kind for that matter.
5;Excellent Jelly Beans - Highly Recommended;"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Lemon"" jelly beans are very natural tasting and absolutely delicious. I really enjoy the lemon flavor and everyone I shared these with agree that they are indeed very good."
5;Perky's Crunchy Flax Cereal;Perky's Crunchy Flax Cereal arrived timely as stated.  I like the taste of the cereal with and with out milk.
1;BEWARE!;"I ordered the item pictured, Decaf House Blend ""Espresso Cappuccino"" but received Decaf House Blend ""Melange Maison"" in a completely different package.  The order is completely wrong and is not returnable."
2;Tasteless;I recently got a Keurig coffeemaker and tried out different brands of Decaf to come up with a favorite. Newman's Own is definitely not among them.
5;Great flavor and quality!;I use this oil for dipping breads and for making salad dressing. It has a very nice flavor, it tastes like avocados but is not overpowering.
5;For those of you who have been searching for Clearly Canadian and those who haven't;Years ago Clearly Canadian offered flavored, carbonated water in glass bottles. As the years went by it was harder and harder to find as grocers and gas stations stopped carrying it.
5;Excellent Tea!;"Switched to ""Mighty Leaf Tea Organic Spring Jasmine"" (by Mighty Leaf) after trying Sunflower Jasmine Tea (by Sunflower).  The Sunflower package is not secure."
1;Too Weak to Use;I've just spent an hour and half trying to get rid of the maggots from my compost cart because of this lousy product.  I have been using them for several years but not anymore.
5;BEDTIME SNACKS;Goliath, Delilah, and Daisy all give this product a thundering thumbs up.  This is their bedtime snack and we have no trouble getting them to go to their bedroom (which they graciously allow my wife and I to share) and ready themselves for the night.
5;The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!;"Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that ""crunch"" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start."
5;Great for HS lunch;Great for HS lunch, kid enjoy as a snack also, will buy again. Salted chips are good too, tried them too.
5;Simply the best.;Well, I'm a Barry's girl through and through. I drink the regular caffeinated Barry's tea during the day and I drink this decaf version at night.
5;My Cats All Love It (But.....);I normally pick up the RC Special 33 formula at my local pet food supply chain. However, prices keep creeping up and now they want $29 (before tax) for a 7 pound bag.
4;I love it except for...;This is a great product that I enjoy daily because I can adjust the fizz as well as the strength of the taste. I have my own formula for preparing this drink to meet my personal desire and I have no problem with the artificial sweetner.
2;Poor taste and ugly;I've bought many types of blooming teas and this one was a mistake. The tea they make is ok, but not incredible.
5;A Tea to Stash in Your Cupboard;I tried this tea in Seattle two years ago and just loved it.  It was unavailable at my local health food store, but I found it on Amazon.
2;You gotta like fish;What can I say, it tastes like fish.  Like really fishy fish.
5;Mustard with flair!;I grew up on Nance's mustard, but haven't found it locally in many years, so once again, Amazon saves the day.  It's thin enough to pour out of the bottle, but is still very creamy, and sharp, just like it says.
1;Same as a truck stop;The harsh headline is not because I'm mean..
5;Best Tea I've Ever Had;Very Fresh, Very chunky, and completely awesome. Most chunky teas don't seem to have much flavor, but this brews quite strong.
5;Excellent!;This product is excellent.  The best jerk seasoning out there but hard to find except on the internet.
5;awesome!;These are great for treat bags.  Large and very colorful!  Definitely worth the money.
5;Delicious! And at about half the cost of other suppliers;I received a box of these for Christmas from a co-worker and after spreading them out by limiting myself to one a day, I knew I had to find them to purchase for myself. The truffles are creamy and chocolaty, as truffles should be, but these also have a wonderful, bitter-yet-sweet flavor that is accentuated by the dusting of cocoa.
5;Our kittens eat it quickly. They don't get sick after.;There are many reasons I'd love some kind of cat-human translator. Hearing their food preferences sits pretty low on that list, since I imagine they love all food.
5;Delicious!;I tried this seasoning after buying it at the local market and now they don't carry this one! It is so good, I now buy it through the mail. It has a great combination of seasoning and I use it all of the time on salmon and other cuts of fish.
5;Hog casings;Great packaging. Make sure to soak the casings for more than the minimum half hour.
2;I don't like the flavor;I am not a huge mixed drink person. I prefer a hearty beer or a tasty wine to a liquor concoction.
3;Smaller than expected, but nice presentation;The people we gave this basket to over Pesach LOVED it!  But I felt it was a little small for the price.  But the contents were good quality and the presentation was nice.
1;Quantity not as described;What looks like a great deal is actually a terrible one. This is ONE box of 5 packs of granola bars (packed like Nature Valley).
2;Photo on package false;photo does not represent product. Seaweed salad is made mostly of Wakame stems, the bright green crunchy seaweed shown on package.
5;Great Natural Tea To Help You Sleep;This tea is great for adults and children. My parents used to brew natural chamomile tea with mint for me when I was a child, too.
5;amazingly delicious almonds;These almonds are the most wonderfully satisfying snack ever. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds then you will absolutely love these nuts.
5;more like canned beans than soup;very tasty and filling.<br /><br />great value.
4;Good but really sweet;The bars taste good but are very sweet (18 grams per bar).  Would not recommend shipping during the summer to the southern US states, they melt a little.
5;Quisp;Same great taste from my childhood. Better than Cap'n Crunch because it does not tear up the roof of your mouth.
5;We call it BABY CRACK....;"My 8 mo. old simply LOVES this stuff! It was his 1st official ""finger food"" so I think it's a combo of, ""I can do it myself"" plus it tastes good, and dissolves easy in the mouth- which is kind of important when you only have 6 teeth! Only other mom-comment here is that I wish they had a little MORE greens in it, as it's not even close to green in color, like they just waved some greens over the bowl when making it."
5;These are awesome;I discovered these when a fellow gluten free friend in Ireland told me that she stocks up on these when she comes to the U.S.
1;Not worth the money.;Didn't make me happier, and I didn't like the taste either..
5;I Can't Believe it has No Sugar!;This is a great sugar free dessert!  I did not know there were so many flavors until I looked for it on Amazon.com.
1;Tastes like Lipton tea, no blackcurrant flavor.;This tastes pretty much like your plain old Liptons tea. I LOVE cassis (black currant) flavor and was so looking forward to the tea.
5;Schnoodle loves this food;Our Schnoodle, Bella, is a very picky eater. Finally found something she likes which makes me happy because I try to buy Newman products whenever I can.
4;alternative to oatmeal;It's easy to make, a warm cereal for someone who does not tolerate oat or wheat. I whip an egg in it & add fruit & honey.
5;Chew Sweetarts are Great;I don't know what it is about these chewy Sweetarts but I just love the strong, powerful sweet and sour taste and the chewy texture.  The chewy Sweetarts seem more sweet and have a more powerful flavor than the regular hard candies.
3;Neither Bold Nor Spicy;I do not expect miracles from Taco Bell and this certainly is not a miracle.<br /><br />it is bland, with a hint of spice.
5;Bought this for the Fiber;Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there..
5;Yum;Cookie was so soft and my son acutally loved it and he really doesnt like a lot of item. I really love this cookie and i did purchase again.
5;Tasty, crunchy and healthy;This product has a wonderful mix of flavors and textures in every bite.  It is a mix of whole grains, blueberries, and flax seeds that are then lightly flavored with vanilla.
5;Almonds;These almonds are big and tasty. There are 3 packages in the order making the cost about the same or better then from a major supermarket.
5;Good taste.;I tried to stay away of the coffee so I deceiced to have one cup a day of Decaf..
4;Green Mountain Keurig Cups;As always, the coffee was excellent.  Just wish the price would go down on these, although this purchase I thought was reasonable.
1;Unfresh product;I am very disappointed in this product.  The first box was 75% hard, not a soft powder in each envelope.
5;Buster Cube is entertaining for dog and owner!;"I really believe this is a very useful and must have ""toy"" for your dog. Our morning ritual now consists of filling the cube with our dogs normal hard dog food when we have our breakfast."
3;Don't Really taste a difference from regular sugar;I must be honest this is a decent price for this type of sugar.  I tried it once before at a coffee shop and enjoyed it in my coffee with milk.
3;Has it's uses;Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices.
4;Good, But None Measure Up to the Valdosta!;"I fell in love with the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;LOVE this tea!;I absolutely love licorice and I love this tea. I have a glass nearly every night in the winter.
5;Spicy flavorful peppercorns;I bought these peppercorns to make Asian dan dan noodles and the noodles came out great.  The peppercorns add a definite spicy flavor, very tasty for those who like spicy foods.
5;Coffee people deliver again.;Coffee people black tiger coffee is yet again another great blend of coffee for the Keurig machine.  I put this on my subscribe and save list.
4;Good, but . . .;I like this brand. I didn't realize I was ordering extra bold.
4;The Energy Booster With No Sugar & Only 4 Calories;5 Hour Energy was like a dream come true for my working spouse.  As a manager, on his feet for thirteen hours a day gets extremely exhausting so when I agreed to receiving a sample from Smiley online in exchange for my opinions, he was the first in line to try it.
5;Great  taste and texture;"Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare! Just add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. You can use your bread machine if you put it on the ""Quick Bake"" cycle."
5;Love it!;Great product.  Great Value.
5;Wow;I store these in the cupboard and if I run out of milk I have regular and chocolate handy. Also I can grab a few milks and some granola bars when I leave to pick up kids at school.
5;Great service;The coffee is great, but having this box of 50 K-cups arrive at the same time each month is wonderful.  No ordering, no worry, and most of all, never out of coffee.
5;Superb in protein shakes;I'm a delighted fan - I discovered this in the local health food store. Tried it in my protein shakes - I'm hooked!!! It's incredibly good.
2;overcooked;Glennys organic soy crisps have always been my favorite brand until the last few times I've ordered the 6 pack from amazon.  The crisps are overcooked and have a burnt flavorless taste to them.
5;AMAZING!!;These tomatoes are unlike any tomatoes I have ever tried.  San Marzano tomatoes are known for low acidity and high sweetness due to being grown ONLY in the fertile volcanic soil at the base of Mt.
5;love these;I get a lot of stuff from the Amazon Vine program but this is the first item that I liked so much that I added a subscription to my account for them. Freakin' LOVE these things.
4;Good Noodles, Ok Flavor;This brand is my favorite Vegetarian ramen but I prefer the Asian Vegetable flavor over the lemon grass ginger.  I guess it is a matter of taste though.
1;Excellent, but PRICE is way off!;This is an excellent product, but for the same quantity it is $5.34 at Costco.
5;""" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""";I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician.
5;Addictive!;This crunchy version of Sunbutter is so very delicious.  It really does taste like peanut butter too.
5;Great Product;I've been using this product for several months, and it works very well. Since I only use half the recommended dose, I use half the amount of hot water recommended to dissolve it.
4;My Yorkie Loves them!;This is the first time I bought this product for my 9 yr old yorkie..
4;Good Stuff;I'm a tea drinker (can't stand coffee), so I was unsure about trying this tea after seeing the reviews about how well it replaces coffee.  It doesn't taste like any of my favorite teas.
5;Green tea;I have been ordering YamaMotoYama Green Tea for years. This is a reliable source.
5;Fixed My Dogs Hip;I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy.
5;Mallomars. The greatest cookie on the planet;I received this product faster than I anticipated. They were fresh.
5;I love this stuff;This is a really great beverage.  I'm really surprised that it isn't carried in any grocery store in my area, because this is a really great fruit juice soda, that is better for you then regular soda.
5;Our favorite BBQ sauce;NOH HAWAIIAN Bar-B-Q Sauce is our favorite sauce, bar none. The flavor is perfect on everything including used as a condiment  on virtually anything.
5;Kitty love;My crazy picky calicos just love this stuff.  I'm so surprised because they only want dry food.
4;Zoey loves them, but they're kinda greasy;"Merrick turkey patties, about 4"" across.  For some reason, I imagined these to be a chewy texture, like jerky."
1;YUK;These things are HORRIBLE!  They are very salty, have very little flavor and are just plain nasty.  Don't waste your money on these.
5;Great gummy bear;This is one of the best gummy bear I've tried so far. It's not too sweet.
1;DAMAGED & WRONG PRODUCT - do not waste your money!!!;Ordered 2 packages of these lollipops for my son's valentines - they arrived MELTED AND MIS-SHAPED.  The product description & photo showed them as all red - I got mainly pink.
5;18 BARS- it says 'pack of 8' , but you get 18 bars-GREAT;These Payday Peanut Caramel candy bars were very yummy. I don't know why the first description of the product says 8 bars.
4;Good;Good coffe at a very good value. Tried others but will stick with this one.
5;This makes my sweet tooth very happy!;I'm on the HCG Diet and I can't eat any sugar or starches right now and I've got a big sweet tooth..
1;disappointed;I did not read description closely enough where it says that this product adds no flavor. I think because it is a goldish color, I thought it would add a butter flavor which it does not.
4;delicious, but use caution;My husband is from Hungary & this is the product his family uses. HOWEVER, be careful because I have purchased it more than once (in different stores) and it has had tiny wevils in it!<br />Good luck.
2;Not hot;If you like reasonably hot cinnamon this is not for you.  Very mild.
5;Great Price;This is a great tasting product with the best price I could find online or in the store.  This is my favorite flavor they offer.
5;Nice product;This is a great french syrup. You just need few drops to prepare a great a refreshing drink for kids.
5;Good Stuff!;My dog has always been fed Wellness. They make a great product.
5;Spectacular;So sorry I have not found or tried this sooner. I'm all for smooth style european chocolates, but this is nothing less than spectacular.
5;Chicken Poppers;My dogs LOVE these, great for just a treat, or for training. Low is fat and calories, which I worry about as my dogs tend to gain weight easily.
2;Love Reeses, But Not Service;We love Reeses in our family &lt
5;The BEST Deodorant I've Used In Years!;Most of the wetter deodorants sting after shaving..
5;GOT TO TRY EM!!!!!!!;"When I told my wife I had been searching for Pickled Green Tomatoes she asked if I had lost my mind and said ""YUCK"". I explained that I had some years ago and loved them."
5;Absolutely Fabulous Product!!!!;My bottle feed kitten has suffered from loose or runny stools for his whole life after being weaned off the bottle. We have tried many high dollar foods and all types of sensitive stomach foods.
3;feel better;It seems like this product is working as I do feel better.<br /><br />Will probably order some more.
5;So Peachy;Hmm I just realized I drink more tea than I thought. This is some pretty good stuff, so can ya blame me? All I can say is Stash makes really good tea, my tea cozy hats off to ya! Seriously, you think I have a tea cozy? No my tea gets drank this way
5;Dog bone;This is my dogs favorite toy. I have bought two and she has both of them out to chew on all thee time.
3;Good;Is is a nice tea, and with whole blueberries its awesome. I give it three stars though, because the flavor isnt really as bold or sweet as i was hoping for.
4;Yum and Ouch!;These are pure ambrosia if you love figs as well as dark chocolate and even worth the cost for only a quarter pound..
5;My review;This product is hard to find, but Amazon made it easy to get. These are an old time favorite with my father.
1;RipOff;This is a crappy deal.  You can get a box of capri sun at Kroger for 1.
5;Good Taste, Bit Pricey;I've tried this one and also the illy cappachino mocha version (which is a slightly larger can).  I thought the mocha version seemed to mask the taste of the illy coffee and make it a bit generic.
4;My favorite so far..;I have tried 2 differ powder forms of Stevia and one other liquid..
5;old dude;sardines are extremely healthy and Reese sardines are the best I have found.My cat(16 yrs old)was overweight and her fur was dull.
3;Gatorade works great, but quantity is skimpy for the price;While exercising in the hot southern California sun, it's vital to keep hydrated and to replace salt and other minerals lost while sweating. I bike ride for two to three hours on weekend days and drink quarts of Gatorade.
5;Love the mustard and glad I got it through this company!;I was hunting for rasberry honey mustard to dip pretzels in since Omaha Steaks no longer makes theirs so I checked this website. Since there were so many of the same bottle I checked them all to add up prices and shipping (which I find annoying done on a per item basis!).
5;This is good coffee;I went to Hawaii many years ago and fell in love with their coffee and have been looking for that flavor again.  For the price of this coffee it can't be beat.
4;Yummy!;Great product, very tasty!  I was disappointed with store-bought pop-corn in my Nostalgia kettle popper.  The only problem I have is there is too much butter flavored salt, I typically pour half of it out.
5;"Its ""Amazing"" because it is amazing!";I am a repeat customer of Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix.<br /><br />It is truly amazing and my son loves it.
4;Convenient Caffeine Fix;It's not often I drink iced coffee but I found this drink very convenient when I didn't have time to brew hot coffee.  The flavor is a good coffee flavor.
5;Best food for upset tummies;If you have a cat that has not been doing well, stomach wise, try California Natural.  Ingredients are simple - chicken and rice.
3;Strong Brew But a Bit Bitter;I like a hearty cuppa tea but this brew is a little to harsh for me. Heavy, strong flavor BUT with  an unpleasant harsh acidity that spoils the brew.
5;Perfect for the Beach;I just love these Happy Tot Pouches.  They are perfect when you are on the move.
3;Nothing special...;After almost 10 days of use, my wife says that her hair is so strong she can easily pull out a car from a ditch..
5;spicy cruncy goodness;these are fantastic!! spicy, crunchy..
5;Yummy!;I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.
2;Not Strong enough;I like a really strong cup of coffee so was disappointed with both the strength and flavor of this brand.  I had to make a 6 instead of an 8 oz cup and it still tasted rather bland.
4;tasty;I tasted this before feeding it to my nephew.  It tastes just like you would expect apple sauce to taste if it were made with pears.
5;MMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...................;YUMMY! HAVING LIVED ON THE BIG OSLAND WE WOULD GO TO THE MAUNA KEA RESORT FOR THE SUNDAY BRUNCH AND THEY SERVED THIS BOTTOMLESS AS ICE TEA. NONE OF US EVER PUT SUGAR IN IT AS THE FLAVOR IS DELICATE AND SUGAR JUST DISRUPTS THE PURE FRUITY FRESHNESS AND TURNS IT INTO SOMETHING IS WASN'T MEANT TO BE.
2;Not a good bio bag to use as a litterbox bag;I got these for my 2 cats litter boxes and the opening of these bags is too small. You end up having to touch the stuff too much to get it in the bag.
5;best there is;i dont have much to say about this product but that its the best dog food out there by far. I have been feeding all my rotts from puppy to adult this brand and i get nothing but compliments on there coat etc.
5;fantastic honey;This is a fantastic honey.  Most honeys you get a hint of what flower it came from.
1;Dead on Arrival CAUGHT ON FIRE;I was excited to get this because of the price, but was very disappointed to find out that not all of them worked once receiving them.  The one that did work randomly caught my LAMP ON FIRE.
1;It's HORRIBLE!;I can't begin to tell you how awful this stuff is. If you're looking for a peanut-butter substitute, you will be sorely disappointed.
5;delish;Best packaged gravy on the market. Tastes just like homemade.
1;CARCINOGEN ALERT!!!!;Recently (6 hrs prior to this writing), this company got busted selling instant noodles with first degree carcinogenic ingredients.  They refused recall of the products for some reason.
1;NO Criiter Ridder !!!;I found this product to be totally INEFFECTIVE in regards to my woodchuck/groundhog problem.  The woodchuck walked right through the barrier ( which I had spread thick and wide ) with no hesitation.
5;Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!;When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets.
5;Marmarabirlik is the best!;Hi,<br />I am from Turkey and marmarabirlik is the best brand of olives I have ever tasted. My family has been using this brand ever since we were born.
5;Relaxing moments;Even if you are not a tea lover, you will love this tea. Great for the entire family(hot or cold).
5;Great snack;My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
5;Secret Pleasure  &  Nutritional Powerhouse;My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three
5;Brings back memories;"Remember eating these as a kid. My husband and I have been telling our own children about the ""marathon bar"" for years and when I found them online, I thought ""this is the perfect Valentines Day gift for my husband""."
5;Kwilson;Purchased my first bottle at a health food store and paid 23 for 8 oz bottle.  Amazon price was super.
5;Surprisingly helpful;I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased it since the Neuro representatives were so friendly.  I was en route to my college graduation when I picked this up, and sipped it until I got to the site.
1;ingredients are EPA registered pesticide;We have stopped buying Kellogg's Frosted Flakes because the corn in this product is an EPA registered pesticide. It is Bt GMO corn which is patented by a chemical company that genetically engineered it in a lab and turned it into an EPA registered pesticide.
4;Tasty healthy grahams;"As a natural foodie I was pleased with the ingredient list. All too often there is one baddie ingredient that stops me from buying a product such as corn syrup or chemical ""stabilizers/preservatives"" I found them tasty with enough sweetness to tame my sweet tooth."
4;Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.;I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting.
5;Everyone deserves a second chance...........;..
5;Very tasty;I love these noodle bowls. They taste very good and you can easily add to them if you want.
5;NOT FOR THE TIMID;A FULL BODIED, BOLD COFFEE WITH FAVOR THAT STANDS UP EVEN WITH HALF & HALF ADDED.<br />FOR REAL COFFEE LOVERS.
4;What a Deal!;This is a good quality coffee for a great price. I buy it by the case for my office and get it even cheaper by setting an automatic delivery every 3 months.
5;It's a 100% HIT!!!;This food looks and smells DELICIOUS, even to mom's vegetarian nose! Frankly, most canned cat food makes mom heave and gag, especially when it's heated for a sickie, so she's actually looking forward to having to nuke some of this.<br /><br />She started with our picky eater, who, not coincidentally, hasn't been here very long and who's never eaten canned food since he's been here, no matter what flavor it was.
5;Tasty & delicious Lemon Curd;"We are huge fans of ""Mrs. Bridges Lemon Curd, 12-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)"" so we like to keep them on stock in our pantry & refrigerator to use on biscuits, scones and with fresh fruit."
5;Extinct Dinosaurs;I have two golden retrievers and 5 Nylabone dinosaurs in the house - at least temporarily, for the dinosaurs that is.  These are, paws down, the absolute favorite chew toy in our house.
5;Yum!;Great mix for the belgium waffle maker that I bought from Amazon.  I make one for my son in the a.
5;Great taste!;This is a great BBQ sauce. I have tried a lot of sugar free products and this one is the best I have had.
4;Lots of fiber;Having celiac disease, I am always looking for ways to get more fiber in my diet. This granola tastes great (as breakfast cereal or in yogurt or ice cream), and has a ton of fiber in it.
5;Hot Spots can be from food allergies;After spend $$$$ and several years of trying to find out what was creating fur loss (hot spots) and itching on my poor dog, it all came down to food allergies. This food is wonderful.
5;Delicious;My nephew is a picky eater. He would only eat cheddar goldfish.
2;GREAT product, but wayyyyyy too expensive on Amazon!;I just received this item and am very disappointed. The product is GREAT!  I am a cook and this is my favorite olive oil.
1;FLAVORLESS;I am very disappointed in these K cups.  I made it using the smallest cup size and it still tastes like hot water.
1;BUTTER IS THIN, JAR IS PLASTIC AND HAS NO INNER SEAL;This product arrived with the jar lid off and almond butter spilled all over the inside of the shipping box.  The jar is soft plastic, which allows phthalates, from the plastic, to enter the food contents.
4;stinky tea;Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more.
5;A wonderful tea;I originally bought a box on clearance at the local drugstore. So glad I did!<br /><br />It's a nice mellow tea, lightly fragrant with vanilla.
4;Great but Noisy;"This is definitely a step up from the IQ ball as far as the level of difficulty.  My Border Collie was very frustrated by it for the first few week, so he barked at it incessantly! Now he has fun with it, and it keep him busy, giving him a ""job"" to do."
1;These are not unsweetened cranberries;I searched for unsweetened cranberries on the Amazon website. These come up.
4;FF cat food easy to order, arrived on doorstep on time;We started ordering Fancy Feast cat food online this summer for the sake of CONVENIENCE and PRICE.  It arrived ON TIME, and, of course, our 2 cats LIKE the food.
1;Tastes nothing like you would hope or expect.;I rarely type reviews but simply have to after trying this product. I picked it up at Whole Foods and yes, the color is kinda strange, but I can get past that.
4;great;It does what it says. weightless.
5;Affordable Premium Food;We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.
5;Best orange bitters on the market;Well balanced, aromatic, just spicy enough without being overpowering.  Highly recommended for your next manhattan, and a lovely stocking stuffer.
5;Cat food;My 10 year old cat wouldn't eat anything for two week because I was trying to find something that would help with his puking all over my house..
5;Our cat loves these.;Our cat loves these hairball treats. In fact, I have to make sure she can't get to them.
5;Stash English Breakfast Tea;Alway a Irish Breakfast fan, I was surprised I enjoyed this tea so much.  Found myself choosing it over much more sophisticated teas.
5;These are great!;I really love Cliff Bars, they have a lot of calories though and can get old after a while..
5;Great Product!;I've been ordering these Switch drinks in the variety pack by the case for a good number of months now. Really enjoy all of the flavors, and they are a nice alternative to regular soda.
5;The Best I've Found;We've been using these bags regularly for several years now with no complaints. We don't overload the trash and these work really well for us.
5;Wonderful Chocolate Treat;I was delighted to find this product on Amazon because I can no longer buy it locally.  It has a wonderful deep chocolate flavor and a friend and I enjoy one every morning with our coffee at work.
3;Okay;For some reason I was expecting these cookies to be larger, more like the Grandma's brand size, but they were the same size as a standard crisp Chips Ahoy! cookie.<br /><br />The cookies were soft, and definitely gooey with the filling inside.
5;Best Value Pack Raisins!!!;These are the best quality raisins i've found on Amazon. The Value Pack makes it more then worth it.
5;Tasty, soothing and actually helps enhance immunity!;Traditional Medicinals Echinacea Plus is an herbal remedy in tea form designed to support the immune system.  Echinacea is a Native American herb and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the US and Europe.
5;My favorite hazelnut k-cup!;I love this brand!  The best hazelnut flavor ever! I wait for it to go on sale because it is more expensive than the other brands.  Also, as another reviewer noted, it does say decaff on the bottom of the package! It really should state that in the product description.
3;"More ""fragrant"" than flavorful";We bought this in hopes of turning our homemade lattes into white chocolate mochas, based on the rave reviews. I was disappointed by this product.
5;Great for ice coffee;During the summer I like to add lots of ice to my coffee and make it cold. However adding lots of ice will tend to dilute the coffee and make it bland.
5;My personal fave;My husband gave me a Keurig coffee maker, so we've been trying different flavors of coffee.  To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.
5;5 pounds!!!;There is no way you can go wrong. You buy this bag and you have all the fun in the world while you are at home or on the road.
5;My standard breakfast tea when I need a little kick in the morning.;Since I am not a coffee drinker (I know shocker, we are out there!) I sometimes need a little pick me up in the morning.  This organic breakfast blen tea is great in doing that.
3;cinnamon;product had a few heart shaped pieces in the bag..
4;Great flavor (and ingredients)...not quite strong enough flavor.;The texture is great:  crisp, but the entire thing doesn't turn to dust that you inhale because it's brittle.<br />The ingredients are great:  no added chemicals<br />The oats are.
5;A good after workout snack;I purchased these to snack on after my workouts. Now I find myself just snacking on them all the time!! They're really good and come in a variety of flavors.
5;Perfect;The Wise Cheez Waffles came in as promised.  They were very fresh and a great surprise for my Husband.
5;Good flavor;Diet Ginger ale is great from the store. Schwepes and Canada Dry have good offerings.
3;Smells good, but has a flavored coffee aftertaste;I was expecting the flavor of a chocolate glazed donut when you take a bite, but I forgot that this is really coffee. It does smell good, but it has an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about.
5;Love these bars!;I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them.
3;They are okay;I was first introduced these at my yoga studio,of course everyones gona love them after you sweat all your salt out.I then bought them at whole foods and now trader joes are selling them.
5;Lots of okay matcha for amazing price;Matcha comes in many different grades. Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.
5;Nothing But the Very Best;These are the best gummi bears ever!!!! I love the variety of flavors. Watermelon and strawberry are my favorites.
5;My dog loves these dental chews.;My dog loves these dental chews and they work well to keep most of the plaque off her teeth.  That saves on the vet bill.
2;Starbucks white mocha it's not;I found a way that I am able to drink this. Make a very, VERY strong espresso shot and then brew this.
2;Now Bad, Was Once Good;This used to be really good tea. For two years we drank it and really liked it.
1;Be careful of foreign objects, I almost broke my tooth;I recently bought a bag of these from the store near my house.  It tasted yummy.
5;My puppy LOVES it!;I bought 4 high end dry foods that my miniature poodle simply would not eat. I tried mixing it with canned food and broth, but she'd lick off the canned food and leave the kibble.
5;I love it for my my morning latte!;I am not that picky, but because I can't afford a good burr grinder, I need preground espresso. And I mostly use espresso for lattes.
5;Nutiva company review.;There was a very unusual situation that arose with me concerning this product.  Nutiva contacted me and was genuinely concerned.
4;Coconut Palm Sugar - maybe;"I'm not sure it is so great that I bought Coconut Palm Sugar.  Since then, my weight has begun CLIMBING !  I listened to Dr Oz but I'm wondering whether he just talks us into something then lets us buy it and ""leaves."
4;One of the best Amy's Soups;I don't remember what I paid for this in the grocery store (I didn't buy it on Amazon, I'm just reviewing the soup itself) but it was more expensive than most soups. I got it at Big Y and it was almost 4 dollars, which is REALLY pricey for soup, organic or not.
5;wonderful tuna;hard to get tuna in olive oil here..
5;Works Well;I have fibromyalgia and my sleep cycle can really get off. I try many different things.
1;Crust is Terrible;I used to love to make Chef Boyardee pizzas. They were inexpensive to make and tasted good, but not anymore.
2;If you like lotsa cream and sugar...  Maybe...;If you like a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you will prob like this.  I personally do not.
3;This is peanut brittle (with almonds);Tasty, but a healthy snack this is not.  Absolutely coated (glazed) with sugar, hard as a rock.
1;Dry nd not so tasty;To each his own, but I did not care for his product at all.  I found the end result too dry and I found the taste pretty bad - I have had healthy products that rank far above this.
5;Perfect Texture! True Fruit Taste! Irresistable!;Lets face it, when you buy gummies of any kind you already expect them to be..
5;GOOD price on Amazon and recommended by Cook's Illustrated;I bought this because I wanted to keep tomatos in stock, all our summer tomatoes are gone, lycopene and I am boycotting Heinz.  12 tubes of this takes up as much room as one jar of Prego tomato sauce.
5;Never got to taste it-kids stole it;My kids got ahold of this and took it all before I ever got the chance to taste it. They took it to their apartment.
5;I love these pretzels!!!;I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.
4;Just a bit too hard.;These were fine treats. I love that they are made in the USA.
5;Great for descaling senseo machine;We purchased for descaling senseo machine.  Using about 3.
5;No grassy aftertaste, great green tea. Love, Love, Love;I really enjoy this green tea, this is my favorite green tea out of dozens that I've tried. No bitterness or grassy aftertaste.
3;Made in China;Great product but made in China. Once I realized this after purchase, I got a little worried.
1;Didn't help health issues;I have a uterine fibroid and after ingesting a small amount of this product daily I could feel more discomfort in that area, so stopped drinking it.  Not sure if there are artificial hormones in these animals that are butchered to make this product but it did affect me negatively.
5;morroccan tea;Love this tea. Had it for the first time when I was stationed in Morocco while in the USAF.
5;Great buy!;I visited NY for the first time last summer, and after trying the Frozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity, my boyfriend and I decided we could not live without it. We bought three packs of the mix to bring back home to LA.
5;hot cocoa;For the price I think the cocoa cups are very good. I will order them again.
5;Sugar free Carmel Syrup/Torani;I get three bottles of this for a little bit more than I would pay for one bottle in my city.  I love it!!  Free shipping when you do automatic shipment.
4;Best herbal laxative I've had;"I usually drink this tea during my monthly or after a day in which I've had very heavy meals. When compared to products like ""Colon Cleanse"" this is incredibly gentle on my system."
4;Healthy Pizzas;This flour is awesome, we used to buy lot of pizzas from pizza shops which are unhealthy high in fats, since we tried this flour we are making healthy and delicious pizzas at home itself.<br />Thanks to Amazon for selling this amazing product.
1;Makes babies constipated!;Wrongful advertisement! I usually don't write any reviews but I had to give this one a star. Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated.
5;Get this;This is awesome. Yes you will want two bags after you purchase this product.
5;OMG I thought I would never find this;I have a recipe that calls for two 3.3 ounce boxes of white chocolate instant pudding.
5;Oh WOW !!!;These are absolutely delicious. The flavor, texture, everything is wonderful.
5;Top Restaurant Quality;This waffle mix (original)is used in many kitchens that serve waffles on buffets etc.  The natural one is my choice because why not go for real vanilla.
5;Rye Triscuit Locator;Dudes/ettes,<br /><br />They are savory. Don't do without!<br />Found them at Randall's stores in my 'hood.
4;VERY TASTY;These are very good crackers with a very italian cheesy taste. All 4 boxes had quite a few crushed at the bottom of the boxes/bags- bags inside the boxes.
1;K-Cups not properly sealed - coffee all over inside of box;I was surprised when I opened the box and found that some of the K-Cups were not properly sealed.  Coffee was spilled all through the inside of the box and some of the K-Cups were obviously unusable.
5;really good stuff and non-fat too!;Hard to beat this cocoa.  Taste great, and is non-fat.
3;Great tasting but crumbles;My dog goes crazy for these treats but when I try to cut it to smaller sizes they crumble into powder. It would be great it the company made smaller size treats for small dogs because these are pretty big.
5;Great gum but tough to find in stores.;My husband loves this gum, but we find only a limited number of stores carry it.  So, I looked online and was able to buy a whole case so we won't run out for quite some time.
2;straight sugar;Cheaper to buy a bag of sugar & eat it with a spoon!  Fruit is diced in small pieces so forget tasting anything but sweet--as in candied.  No potential health benefits here.
5;This tea made me a tea drinker;The first time I had this tea was at a friend's house when I was out of town and had gotten sick. When I had returned home, I sought it out.
5;True to the original.;From Columbus, live in Austin Texas now.  I love Skyline (refuse to ever go to a Gold Star) and I find this to be very true to the original.
5;Please make in the U.S.!;After staying in SE Asia for a while, I found these in the supermarket and boy, was I impressed. Even my husband, who typically likes his coffee strong, started swiping my Nescafe coffee packets.
2;Not the best quality;The quality was terrible for some of the teas. One even had a moldy taste.
4;Great Support;Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it.
5;So Fresh and Light!;The Philippine Dried Mango is delicious, not too sweet and not too sour, it's a perfect tropical snack. I love it because I think it's special in a simple way.
5;A Real Gift to Those of Us Who are GF;This is a blessing to those of us who are GF.  There are so many things we can make again now that we have Bisquick!  Not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again!  How nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again!  Since GF products are so expensive the best place to get it is at Amazon on the automatic shipment plan.
5;Peanut Butter M&Ms;Amazon recruits great sellers and this is one of them!  The 6 pkgs. of Peanut Butter M&Ms arrived in a timely manner and the product was superb!  Will order from this seller again.
5;Maple Syrup;There's maple syrup and there's maple syrup. My wife and I are from the East Coast (she from Vermont) and we've tried maple syrup from other regions and those just don't measure up to a Vermont syrup.
5;My Favorite;Happy Squeeze Pumpkin is my absolute favorite snack to have during the day. It has to be refrigerated for the best flavor.
5;Woof Woof.;SmartBones are a wonderful treat for your dogss.  My two Dachushunds love the peanut butter flavor.
1;If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash;Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different.
4;Great when you don't have a lemon!;I am a huge Spice Islands fan.  I hate that so few grocery store chains carry their wonderful quality products any more.
3;Nothing special, same as store bought raisins;Not gourmet.  Just typical store bought raisins.
5;Great Salami for the price;This is a great deal for 6 packages of salami. This has a great taste, a little oily but what packaged Salami isn't?  A great buy to have for potlucks and last minute sandwiches.
1;All packaging, lacks flavor;The Good:<br />+ Eco-friendly packaging<br />+ Less expensive per cup<br /><br />The Bad:<br />+ Stale taste<br /><br />While I was excited to see the innovative packaging of this new product, it just doesn't taste good.  It tastes likes the coffee is stale, which makes sense considering that the coffee is exposed to air.
5;A wholesome meal in itself - Great start for the day!;I eat this practically every morning as follows:<br /><br />1/2 cup (low-fat or no-sugar) muesli<br />1/4 cup (skim) milk<br />2 oz. (Dannon Activia low-sugar) yogurt<br />2 T.
5;Flax Plus Cereal;This cereal is great.  It has low carbs and sugar.
2;It's not as natural as Lipton advertises;I think that this Liptons To Go Green Tea Mix tastes OK, but I prefer real tea. My wife likes this Lipton's Decaf Iced Green Tea Mix.
5;Save your grater;I started using Boyajian citrus oils years ago upon the recommendation of a professional baker/chef when I was making my daughter's wedding cake.  Now I use them in almost anything I would normally grate zest into, or I just use a fraction of the zest for the visual appeal.
4;Decent taste, great health;Doesn't taste as good as real peanut butter of course, BUT the small amount of flavor lost is worth the trade off considering how much healthier it is.  The texture/consistency is also pretty much the same as normal PB once mixed.
1;Only Three Bags Came;I ordered the Original Beef Jerky, 3.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) and I got it today.
2;Very disappointing;The Hip Action Salmon Flavor was very disappointing indeed.  I stopped trying to force feed my older cat, covering it with soft cat food, and even using the pill pockets.
5;"My Jack Russell says ""YES!"" Or ""arf,"" I guess..";We recently received a Jack Russell terrier from a man who couldn't take the dog with him to where he was moving. As thanks, we got all of the dog's toys, treats, a bed, and.
5;Excellent canned dog food;This is the first canned  dog food I have purchased (40+ years of buying) that actually smells and looks like it is really nice chicken.  My dogs love it.
2;NOT for tough chewers!!!;We have a lab who is a TOUGH chewer..
5;Speedy Delivery;This cheesecake was meant for my niece in Washington, no sweet or other shop in Washington could deliver to dorms at universities, and I wanted something very special.<br /><br />I emailed to make sure it would be delivered in time.
3;we have 4 differnt coffee machines and this didn't fit any of them;We tried every which way to make this coffee. It is frustrating that each coffee must have it's own system to work.
1;Check the label;"The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are ""All Natural"" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain ""yeast extract."
5;yummo in my tummo;This cocoa dissolves in a nice way without a lot of chocolate clumps at the bottom of the mug. The cinnamon flavor has a 'cozy' aroma/taste.
5;Fast, easy and tastes great.;These are a favorite go-to when I a fast,easy meal but am tired of spaghetti noodles. My grocery store stopped selling these awhile back so I was very pleased to find them on Amazon.
5;love this sugar;This is the only sugar we use. The taste is a little different but we really like it.
5;Beautiful bread!;We have been gluten free for about 10 months.  Prior to this I had never baked  anything with yeast in it for fear that it wouldn't come out right.
5;Love Regular Verona Coffee!;Nuff said. Not to be confused with Dark Verona.
2;hard rock or shell pieces in each one;"Very sweet but good in a pinch IF I didn't have to worry about breaking a tooth. Every bar had one small ""rock"" or possibly shell inside."
3;Average Conditioner--Perfectly Serviceable;I got to admit, after liking the Ultra Shea Shampoo, I hoped to like the conditioner as well.  The packaging is nice--especially with the reversed spout to keep from confusing the shampoo and conditioner in the shower.
5;Favorite chocolate bar in the world;I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat in which to indulge, whether to forget your bad day or to reward yourself for a job well done.
5;Great price, great bags and good for the environment;"Unlike some of the other bags out there, such as the ""biodegradable"" Bags on Board, these bags are TRULY biodegradable/compostable. The Bags on Board are made from polyethylene that will break down, yes, however it will leave little pieces of plastic everywhere which means it's not truly biodegradable in the strictest sense."
5;Really great  cofffee!;We have been enjoying this coffee..
5;Popchips! My new favorite snack;Delicious, light and full of flavor. It's difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is, but BBQ is amazing! I was impressed with the packaging, but I can't imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly.
5;My Cats Went Crazy for These;My cats tend to be very picky eaters esp. when it comes to treats.
2;not a strong enough flavor;I didn't think the flavor was strong or distinctive enough. A pretty inoffensive tea, but after being spoiled by Tazo's Teas, it's hard to look at a tea like this the same way.
3;Soy milk;I like this soy milk (by the way I didn't buy the vanilla but the original).  It's definitely more cost effective and great for long-term storage.
5;Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil;This is the second purchase I've made of this product. It's the cheapest way to buy it and we use about two of these jars per year.
1;Waste of money and time;Worst toy ever!<br />-cheap plastic, not strong<br />-rope too thick prevents treats to fall out<br /><br />I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it.
5;Lemon seasoning;Great seasoning for fish.  I bake fish with this seasoning, add lemon juice, and wrap up in tin foil for a steaming effect.
5;Wellness Core Dog Food;I am frim believer in feeding my pets premium dog food. I have been through a few different kind, and Wellness Core is fantasic.
5;Tabasco Caribbean Style Steak Sauce;I bought a bottle of this steak sauce at Henrys and fell in love. I went back to the store and they didn't carry it anymore.
5;Delish & Reasonable!;Green Mountain Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig pods. I make the big cup, add 1/4 c.
5;Only food that interests my dog who is picky!;My older dog has always been very picky when it comes to eating food.  Especially canned food.
5;Excellent Protein;This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently.
5;Adds some fun to lunch at work;I bought this product last summer when I was experimenting with buying in bulk while I was living at college over the summer and working for Admissions. I brought in the sushi kit one day and had so much fun surprising all of the counselors with sushi.
2;OK drink, ambiguous flavor;"I was given one can of ""No Fear, Super Energy"" to try out for this review.  At the outset I should say that I am not a regular energy drink fan, though I have indulged on occasion, largely out of necessity, when I was desperate for energy or forced to stay awake all night."
4;Handy packs.  Arrived in decent shape.;Pringles are great.  The packs are very small, making the packages handy bit no eco-friendly.
5;Very Delicious;I enjoy the flavor of this very delicious soft peach candy.  It has definitely become one of my all time favorite candies.
5;Just what I expected;Calm has lived up to its name.  In fact it has also helped my son with his muscle twitches.
5;excellent small dog treat;these bones are a perfect treat for my smaller dogs - under 30 lbs each.  They are small enough for my little guys to chew on but last long enough to occupy them for at least half an hour.
5;Fantastic Belgian chocolates!;My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.
1;"Avoid the ""new recipe"" at all costs!";I have to agree with the majority here.  The new 70% bar, made in N.
5;Perugina Baci is a very good chocolate;These hazelnut chocolates are very good.  The box is pretty and romantic (Baci = a kiss or kisses in Italian).
5;Dog will learn how to skydive for these!;My 10 week old learned out to sit, rollover, shake, and open a beer in 20 minutes with these.  Kidding on that part but he actually was attentive to his owner knowing that he would get this treat.
4;coconut oil;DO NOT take a tbs spoon right off the bat..
5;Wonderful Tea.;The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in.
5;Great! The secret to Gluten free bread making!;This is the secret to gluten free bread making. Substitute it in the place of milk powder for dairy free bread.
2;What does it bring to the table?;I like Cheez-Its. I mean, I reeeaaaaally like them, so I never buy them because I don't actually need to eat any Cheez-Its.
5;Best GF cookies!;These cookies are positively delicious.  No one realized that they are gluten free.
4;Good taste fast cup of coffee;The T disc was a good buy.Only complaint is that the disc does not fill a mug--only enough for a cup.
2;If you like lotsa cream and sugar...  Maybe...;If you like a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you will prob like this.  I personally do not.
5;Very yummy mustard!;This is a very yummy mustard, and I do not like mustard!  It is particularly tasty on an open face pastrami on artisan bread.  Amazing!  A soft, mustard flavor that doesn't overpower the other flavors or bite your tongue.
4;Schezwan Bhel;The product is good.<br /> Like the packing of a little spoon,<br />  paper napkin and a packet of sauce (chutney.
3;Different than your standard lemonade.;Its not as tart as one would expect from your standard freshly squeezed lemonade and certainly not like the Minute Maid/Snapple stuff.  Does goes down smoother, weak lemon taste.
5;Great product, although pretty pricey.;This product is probably not for everyone because it is a bit expensive. It is a very effective product and really works.
4;Elderly cat's all-time favorite wet food;Shredded Fare is probably the best wet cat food on the market--no fillers and quality cuts.  My picky cat never tires of it, while she does of other wet foods even in the Elegant Medleys line.
5;A Great Fun Cereal;I have enjoyed this cereal for years. Unlike many 'fun' cereals it has a lot to offer both in nutrition and fiber content.
5;K cup Coffee;Absolutely love Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive K Cups.  It is the best.
1;Taste is indescribable;We've tried this once on everything - beef, chicken and fish.  We haven't cared for it on any of it and the rest will end up in the trash.
5;Excellent for training;These treats are terrific for obedience training. The variety in the Trail Mix package keeps the dog interested and motivated.
5;Spicy and Flavorful...;I've given these to friends that don't eat spicy and they wanted to kill me afterwards.  Actually one person did not want to speak to me at work for a week.
5;Smells of the cafe at home!;Cafe du Monde, New Orleans. Ah, The aroma brings you to the cafe patio, across from Jackson Squire, on a warm morning but not yet too hot day.
5;Donut House Coffee;The regular Donut House coffee is great. It is a light blend, like Dunkin Donuts.
5;Really nice flavor!;First of all, these are 1 cup pods.  It does not make a full pot.
5;Fast and accurate;After I submitted my order, I contacted the company right away through Amazon with my flavor requests.  They sent me an acknowledgment message back, and I received my order with all the correct flavors within a few days.
3;Hipster super premium chocolate not worth price;Nothing bad about this chocolate - it is luscious and elegant and sophisticated as other reviewers have stated - except the price. The price - currently $25 for just over a pound of solid chocolate in six bars - is the deal breaker.
1;Am I missing something?;This olive oil is supposed to be special. I don't taste anything special.
5;Really tasty;I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well.
5;K-cup Sampler;So I was hesitant to order this because of quite a few negative reviews, but I decided to anyway, and I'm glad I did!<br />I searched through quite a few sampler packs before deciding on this one. Anybody who owns a Keurig knows that there are so many varieties of flavors out there, a sampler is really the only way to find one you know you will love.
5;stash tea-orange spice;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Dog treats;My dogs go crazy for these treats.  Zuk'es Mini Naturals Dog Treats are the only treats I order for my dogs.
5;I wanna go to the Madhouse;These might possibly be the best chips ever.<br /><br />The bad news is that we can't keep them in the house.
5;Want something different?;I love this. Use it on all cold-cuts.
5;Sprinkle Sandwiches a Dutch Classic- Delicious!;For those that don't know what this stuff is, it is for a sandwich with butter. But also can be used for ice cream, sprinkles on cakes and cookies.
5;Awesome, heathy, low calorie boost for the active kid or adult.;I don't have any kids--that I know of--and I'm not a health nut but I eat a lot of Clif Bars while cycling.  It's the only real food that's truly portable and it comes in a great variety of flavors.
5;Best Salsa Ever!;I'm not a salsa fan at all.  I don't even like tomatoes.
2;Not so everlasting;I have a 7 month old springer spaniel puppy, and I've been going through toys at a rapid clip. I bought this because I thought it might keep him occupied awhile and that the toy part would last.
3;Tastes great, but low protein and high fat, especially saturated fat;I love the taste and consistency of this bar. And the added calcium is a plus.
5;good smooth cookie with a little kick;I found this vanilla flavor to be the smoothest flavor for all the Java Bites cookies. If you're looking for a raw Java punch this flavor is not for you.
3;Disappointed - should have read more carefully;"I love Yorkshire tea, and usually purchase the 40 count tea BAGS - I purchased these because they were eligible for Amazon Prime shipping (yay), but didn't notice that they are not tea bags, they are ""sachets"" - the bags have no string (good for sun tea and bulk tea) and more importantly, I believe the bags have MORE TEA in them. One of these ""sachets"" did not brew up as strong and flavorful a cup of this great tea as I am used to with the bags."
5;Go For Something Unique;Want a very unique BBQ sauce, this is it.  On a dare I used it on a pork tenderloin roast having no idea how this combination would work.
5;so useful. great purchase!;I've been researching lavende vs. lavender and you can do no wrong with this product.
5;This tea is delightful!!;This Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea is delightful-cold or hot!!<br />It is also very good mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with decaf green tea. It is an<br />all-round wonderful tea.
4;As good as the lil candy, but hard to unwrap;I got a variety bag of hard candies for Halloween this year, and it had Apple & Watermelon Stix. I agree with Cola 1000, no matter how I tried to unwrap them: cold from the fridge, room temperature, slightly warm from pant pocket .
5;My favorite K-cup coffee;Let me start off that before I bought my husband a Keurig for Christmas, I only drank a coffee drink once in a blue moon..
3;The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.;The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.
5;Good buy!;My children(soon to be 3 and soon to be 13 months) ate these up and loved them! I am so happy that I bought them the six pack so I always had a bag on hand.  I had to break the cookies in half for the younger child, as he likes to shove everything whole in his mouth.
1;Sickening filler ingredients, high price;I think the ingredients in this food speak for themselves - cheap filler & byproducts supplemented with vitamins.  After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.
4;Pleasant complement to chicken breast pieces;This is the third Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Dinner I have tried.  Although my favorite remains the Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac because of the large plump macaroni, this dinner kit with broccoli florets comes in second.
5;Love Gerber Good Start Protect;We switched our baby to Gerber Good Start Protect from Enfamil Newborn when he was experiencing moderate digestive discomfort. He was spitting up quite a bit of formula after every feeding, passing lots of gas, and was just really fussy.
1;YUCH!!!!;I just received this product and was surprised to see that the bags were not hermetically sealed, just plastic-lined paper bags folded over at the top. Here are some tests I used: Aroma  upon opening the bag - not so much smell at all
3;Not what I expected;Well, I've only had one cup so far, so I'll soldier on and keep trying to like it.  (After all, I did get stuck with 3 boxes.
4;Yummy, but very fruity.;I was surprised when eating these bars (which I did, happily), that they were much more fruity than you would have thought. I mean heck, these are chocolate almond bars, and yet they taste like dates (dates are listed as one of the first ingredients, for goodness sake!).
5;Great Tea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;Recently purchased after tasting in Sante Fe. Very cheap at $14 for 8 oz.
5;No limits;Excellent. I put on everything: chicken, fish, salad, etc.
2;Not very tasty. disappointed;The granola is very tough to chew and not sweet enough. Also there's barely any raisins in the bag.
5;I Love Tea;Stash Premium Jasmine Blossom Green Tea is just wonderful and very refreshing. I ordered it from Amazon with no problems.
5;I LOVE the Tripple Chocolate Power Crunch Wafers.;Creamy, crunchy and just plain good.  I buy them by the box and they are the best tasting protein bars I've found and getting them on the internet is the best economical way.
5;Love this tea!;I get the best deals on Amazon and this tea is delicious.The price is great and I cannot find this product in the stores.
5;Exactly correct;I ordered this even though so many folks said it was not assorted.  Mine is.
5;Great coffee;Excellent coffee. Fabulous customers service.
5;delicious tea;I love to enjoy a cup of this delicious tea every night.  The taste is smooth and fruity.
1;New formulation is awful;I used to love these crackers, but they have recently reformulated them.  Now they're awful.
5;Dogs favorite treat;My lab loves anything Zukes. He will do almost anything for a piece.
3;Still Loving My GRAY hair!;"After seeing the high rating this product received, I googled ""wheatgrass"" and saw various claims related to such benefits as improvement in digestion, increased energy, both anti-cancer and anti-aging properties, etc. One of the googled anti-aging claims is that wheatgrass will return gray hair (most likely hair that grayed prematurely) to its orignal color."
1;Too many additives;"Carrageenan Gum, one of the ingredients, is not something you ever want to voluntarily put in your body. Research it and the word ""inflammation"" together."
5;Pink Sea Urchins;Very beautiful urchin shells but keep in mind that they are small.  The ones I received are about 2 inches in diameter so all 3 fit in one hand.
1;Not Earth's Best;My baby does best on regular Similac. Even 2 oz of Earth Best (milk based) formula 1-2 times a day  make him spit up a lot (almost womit), and caused him constipation.
5;Best sugar-free gum;"This gum has terrific flavor, lasts as long (or longer) as the gums that contain poisonous aspartame, and does not get that nasty chalky rubber consistency and flavor that most other ""natural"" gums do after a couple of minutes.<br />So far I've only tried the Spearmint and Peppermint (very pepperminty), but judging by the quality of those two, will definitely be trying other flavors."
5;Better than Gatorade!;I love to cycle, and I love to go long distances.  I have always hated the way Gatorade/Powerade/ect.
5;Absolutely the best !;I am originally from the Pittsburgh area, lived on a farm, my parents grew rhubarb. Moving to the south made it almost impossible to find rhubarb unless I actually ordered it from a grocery store.
5;"NOT Produced at Diamond - Do Not be ""Conned"" by Other Reviewers";This is a great dog food and our dogs do very well on it.  Particularly, no gassiness as with some other brands.
5;Love all Edens Beans;I buy these by the case using Subscribe and Save. We love the no-BPA living, organic beans, and great price compared to the local grocery prices.
5;Well balanced BBQ sauce;I really like this sauce as it has great balance.  Not too sweet, not too hot, good texture.
5;Tasty, Crunchy, Gluten Free Ginger Snaps!;I tried some other gluten free gingersnaps and I think these tasted the best.  There was no grainy texture.
3;Tasty but certainly not the best;This tastes like a weak hot chocolate with peppermint in it. It does get a little foamy on top which makes you think it is like a capachino but the flavor isn't strong enough and I really couldn't taste any coffee flavor in it.
5;This works very well when you can't tolerate coconut milk;I have a problem with digesting food, especially coconut milk. I cannot tolerate it (tried fresh and caned) and I don't know why, but this one didn't give me problems.
5;Outstanding!;Like the Bella's Gluten-free All-Purpose Baking Mix, when you make this dough you won't believe it is gluten-free. It tastes incredible.
3;Get What You Pay For;I just ordered this product - i read, and re-read the item info on the page, eventually i understand it to be that i will be getting a total of 45 cookies, and this is it! In one sense, i thought it was 45 cookies per package, with 3 packages - thus, 45 x 3, but then i again re-read the info, and i gather and the more likely answer is, the total is ONLY 45 cookies!!! Now, this is 'neither good' nor 'bad'. All it is, IS, you are paying pretty much the price that is on  the cookie bag if you were to buy one alone at a supermarket, but having it brought right to your door, thus shipping!  So, you are really paying the SAME PRICE of a GROCERY STORE, and little more, for 'shipping' - but, for me, I have no car, so, to have 3 bags of cookies arrive at my door, while i sit sans car, makes things only a little bit easier.
3;Expensive, but it worked!;I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.
4;Tasty Light Crispy Cookie;First, a couple of minor negatives with these cookies.<br /><br />First is the name.
5;Not just for New Orleans.;I grew up with this coffee around.  It a Southeast Asian staple in the pantry!  And yes I'm talking about about cafe sua da (iced coffee w/milk) in Vietnamese (but I'm Cambodian and we drink it as well).
5;Very Pleased...;"My little Cowboy is very happy with Spot's Stew.  It took us a while to find a food that worked for his ""finicky"" tummy but a friend suggested we give it a try."
3;Enjoy Life Cocoa Loco bars;"The Cocoa Loco bars are okay, but I preferred their original recipe for them!  The ""new and improved"" recipe isn't as good.  They are drier and the texture is to powdery, too much like eating cocoa powder."
4;Soap is Soap, Nothing Special;The soap cleaned my body without irritation, so I guess it did it's job.  But I expected more from a product that costs more than my Suave shampoo ($1.
5;Great Bold Coffee;"This is the best ground coffee I've ever tasted from a major coffee brand. It has a bold sharpness to it, that great caffeine ""bite""."
5;dogs love them;all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog.
3;Interesting taste;If I remember correctly this drink has a slight taste of aspirin.  I'm sure it's good for you.
5;Great tasting drink mix;Ok so we all know we need to drink 8 glasses of water a day. That number varies with who you talk to.
3;If you've  never had good honeycomb, this is okay...;..
4;First time trying an organic GingerAle;First I need to qualify this review by saying this is the first organic Ginger Ale I've tried.<br /><br />I do enjoy natural sodas, specifically Rootbeers made with cane sugar, so the taste of REAL sugar is something I love.
2;jet fuel K-cups coffee;I truly like Kona Blend much more. Furthermore,I don't believe it creates more energy.
1;bal;Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients.
4;Coffe Lovers Collection;Three of the four coffees are excellent ..
5;Great breakfast food;Bob's Red Mill creamy buckwheat cereal is great tasting and good for you. It is a grain higher in protein and also has anti-inflamatory properties.
5;Addictive, tasty tea;Azteca Fire isn't as spicy as it claims, and that's not a bad thing. It's complex, chocolatey and delicious and we have to ration ourselves lest we spend all our spare money on it.
5;cat food;its cat food that was offered at a good price..
5;sit, down and stay;My puppy loves these treats and they are highly motivating when used during training.  They haven't affected her digestion system like cheese or hot dog bites did.
5;Great, healthy snack!;This crunchy, delicious snack is low in fat and calories. I ordered one case, and went back and ordered another as I NEVER want to be without it.
5;Love Wei Chaun's oolong tea;This tea is excellent for the body. Very soothing as you drink it and relaxes you instantly.
5;The best thing for cat's teeth;Although it may seem just a tad precious, our vet recommended this for a young cat who doesn't brush.  He has clean teeth, fresh breath, and I hope will have all his teeth all his life.
5;Strangely Fun Candy;The mini nerd candies are all stuck to a cherry colored gummy rope. This a long rope you can twist, swing around or hang from the ceiling for a party.
5;Great way to get a soda fix and have zero effect on your blood sugar! All natural!!;Zevia soda made with Stevia, and ALL NATURAL non toxic sweetener like Aspartame, Sucralose etc..
5;natural vitality;I take this every night and it does the trick.  No more constipation.
1;Worst Beef Jerky I've EVER Had;The following is just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers actually liked this, but I have to say without any doubt whatsoever, this is absolutely the WORST jerky I've ever tried.
5;Just Right!;I grew up in Africa and they sold this delicious curry powder. I'm so happy I can now order it online at amazon since I used to have to order it from Canada.
5;Delicious!;These are the most delicious granola bars ever. I loved them!Healthy, good taste and light but enough filling for a perfect snack or breakfast on the go.
3;I'll pass...;Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea.
5;Great authentic Indian Product;I have always loved ghee with everything I prepare and eat - be it my daily dose of rice and sambar/curry, dosas and idlys or any sweet.<br /><br />I had a tough time getting used to life without ghee when I first came to the US and tried my hand at making ghee using butter.
5;Best chews ever!;I am very picky with what I give my dogs.  I will not give them rawhide BUT they love to chew.
3;not too bad;Couldn't wait to rec my tea order. I read some reviews on other sights and one said it taste and smelled rather fishy.
5;Great for dogs with stomach problems;My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.
3;It doesn't taste like espresso;It doesn't have the deep roasted taste of espresso. It tastes like an ok instant coffee.
4;Great for smart busy dogs!;I have a 2 year old border collie mix who gets bored easily and loves interactive toys. She gets so excited when I bring this toy out.
5;DELICIOUS!;I purchased these because of the outstanding reviews. I needed some cute, yummy animal cookies for my nieces baby shower.
5;Rou for gumbo and use for giblet gravy;I use this instead of white flour and like the taste better when making a rou (base) for gumbo. It requires cooking at a little lower temperature when making a rou but it works just fine.
5;Very refreshing!;I got my first bottle at the health food store so that I could try it out. I don't drink products with fruit or any kind of sweetener or added acids, so this was perfect.
5;Excellent flavor;This soup tastes great. It's a little sweet and creamy, and even better than the Campbell's soup I grew up with.
4;Not bad, good price, I'm satisfied;I have been having migraine seizures and was told to say WAY away from caffeine.  Well drat.
2;Vine Voice Verse;Born in the shadow of Lady Liberty.<br />Autumn's rustling winds brought pumpkins' glow<br />And hopes of marshmallow dreams.
5;I LOVE it...;I recently tried this cereal for the first time..
5;BEST GLUTEN FREE BREAD BRAND;BOTTOM LINE<br />Schar makes the best gluten free bread, bar none.  These are indistinguishable from normal bread, except they taste better, especially when toasted<br /><br />TASTE<br />I love to toast all my bread before eating and, when toasted, these taste better than normal submarine rolls.
5;Schnoodle loves this food;Our Schnoodle, Bella, is a very picky eater. Finally found something she likes which makes me happy because I try to buy Newman products whenever I can.
5;Great Licorice For your Sweet Tooth;Great old fashioned licorice hard candy.  Drops are big enough to discourage overeating, and pack enough taste for just a couple to satisfy a sweet tooth.
5;The kids love them and way healthier than a pop tart!;My kids love these..
3;Trying to be objective;I have had an online energy session. I then tried the water.
4;Best gluten-free bread I have tried;I'm fairly new to the gluten-free world as I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease only a few months ago. I have tried several gluten-free sandwich breads, and Udi's is the best I've tried.
1;New!!! Amazon.com sells biscuit crumbs.;I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received.
3;A Bit of a Disappointment!;I really looked forward to getting and using this tomato paste - I envisioned a paste that didn't have the usual overcooked and slightly bitter quality of canned paste, and one that had a nice concentrated quality that allowed it to be used in the same ways a cook uses regular tomato paste, but with the promised good taste of this product.  However, I was disappointed in my uses of this product, in that it was not as concentrated as I expected it to be, and therefore had to be used in larger quantities that I wanted to use.
5;My cats favorite treats.;Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't. They're picky.
5;delicious matzo soup;My mother loves to do this soup, as we remember our lovely jew family in USA, SO WE CAN SAY This is the best matzo ball & soup EVER..
5;Great for stuffing toys!;These little treats are terrific. My dog loves them and can spend a long time digging them out from a toy I stuff with these.
5;Amazing flavorful chip!;I saw these on display at my supermarket and tried them on a whim.  Boy am I glad I did!  They are spicy and flavorful.
5;Bold yet not too bitter;This coffee is BOLD.  If you want a kick in the pants then this coffee is for you.
5;YUMMMMM!!!!;We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.
1;Stay away;This is gross! I've tried to drink this a couple of times, and each time I reminded why don't like it.  Get a Keurig, and stay away from Dolce Gusto.
1;Eventually threw it out.;My fiance and I hated this tea. She wouldn't drink it and I eventually got sick of its overly fruity flavor and threw it out.
3;Started out okay, but became a lost cause.;This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried.  At first she seemed to like it, and she ate it well.
5;No leaks, No dents, great taste, seems like the packing issues have been fixed;Vita Coco's packing was a fitted box with extra cardboard and probably not enough on it's own. Amazon's added heavy duty bubble wrap that had very little give (different to what I usually see for other items) and box was packed well and I got my Vita Coco in quick time and in perfect condition.
4;It Works!;Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent- Granular Shaker is a wonderful product. Cats, skunks, and all sorts of critters have taken over the yard and this works! The trap is put away because it is no longer needed for the trip to animal control.
5;Yummy!;I love these Peanut Butter Oatmeal Squares and I crave them for breakfast almost every morning.  They are also a delicious and portable snack for later in the day.
5;Mmmm...cream puffs;I only ever had straight matcha prior to purchasing this Red Leaf flavored one. I never even had a matcha latte! And I never ever had Bavarian cream.
5;Sourdough;Bought the sourdough starter for my daughter who is a nutritionist.<br />She has made a hobby out of it and shared the starter with friends.
5;Dee-lish! But only in moderation!;I bought these for my darling mom
5;Excellent Product;This is my second time ordering the 6-pack of Lundberg Wild Blend rice.  The rice just has a better texture than plain white, and is definitely more hardy and healthy.
4;Good to spike up your soup;I like to put a few drops of this to my soup, to spike it up a little bit just enough to tickle my appetite.  It is made up of soybean oil, sesame oil, chili peppers, and some other ingredients.
5;Yummy!;item is as described and at a great price vs in-store.  Yum!! GF loves them.
1;Pond water would taste better..;Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother.
5;VERY LOW SODIUM;I was not quite sure what to expect when I ordered this soup.  I was totally IMPRESSED by the texture and taste.
1;Destroyed;My dogs destroyed this ball in less than 20 minutes. They chewed on the little flaps, removed the treat, and made the ball useless (it didn't hold the treat anymore).
5;All I can say is YUM.;I LOVE chia seeds.  They are a powerhouse of nutrition and you can add them to so many things.
5;Delightful!;First of all, the smell when you open each bag is very pleasing. I like the fact that each tea bag is individually foil wrapped for freshness.
5;Not for health nuts...;I have always loved Slim Jims.  I love the taste of the ?? meat.
5;Cat Crack;Bobbaaayyy!!!  My cat loves this stuff and now ignores her regular kibble and wet food in lieu of her treats.  She's over 16 years old and at that age it's good to see her get excited over something as simple as a handful of kitty snacks.
5;A++ Service;"Besides Timothy's, ""Donut House"" is my other favorite K-Cup coffee to drink so far.."
4;A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor;I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.
3;This is a fine powder;I bought this product thinking that the onion powder is a granulated powder, but it is actually a fine powder, which I usually don't use while cooking.  This is a very good product if you are looking for a fine powder, but not if you are looking for a granulated powder.
5;NatalieCullen;This a great cereal.  Sweet but not too sweet and full of fiber.
5;Excellent flavor;I found this at a local Hannafords supermarket for either $2.50 or $2.
4;Has worked well on my hair;I have been having my hair highlighted for years, so I am always looking for products that care-take long-colored hair.  At the same time, I have oily hair and need to wash it daily.
1;Bad Stuff;This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup. I buy a lot of k-cups this is the by far the worst.
1;Yeast Extract = MSG, They DO Contain Preservatives!;"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that."
5;Number One in Taste;The product arrived quickly and wasn't flat. Vernors is the best ginger ale and no others can compare to its taste.
5;Great for supper at work;I work nights and there often is not anything to eat. I keep one of these in my locker, you don't need a bowl or plate.
5;Greenies are the Best;My dogs get more excited over Greenies than any other treat.  I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.
3;Quite delicious but not as good as real chips;Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal.
5;Delicious high fiber cereal - Even for Kids!;Since there were no reviews, I thought I would share my opinion of this cereal. It is delicious, even my five year old son loved it.
1;Way over priced.;This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.
5;Love those Demerara sugar cubes.;Ever since we went to England many years ago, and we were served coffee and tea with cubes of Demerara sugar to use to sweeten our drinks, we have been hooked on using these cubes. Not only do they add seetness to our morning coffee, but bring back wonderful memories of our trip.
5;Excellent as always;Every time I travel to the UK for business or to visit family, I pick up a dozen rolls of fruit gums. Rowntrees, of course - these are the REAL fruit gums.
5;DELICIOUS!!!!!!!;I am a Starbucks coffee drinker.  I like my coffee bold and tasty with a kick me out of bed.
5;Tasty AND Nutritious AND...try for yourself;Guaranteed to please even finicky eaters who don't like quinoa, amaranth or anything that looks like health food, or even people who want to eat healthy but are in need of a good recommendation. The nutty cinnamon taste was a pleasure, and the bag was gone within two days of its arrival.
2;Strong taste of artificial sweetener;"Though it isn't the ""diet"" version of Sodastream ginger ale, this concentrate still has a strong taste of artificial sweetener.<br /><br />I was disappointed enough in the taste that after the first glass I threw out the remaining syrup."
1;Contains BPA!;I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better.
5;These Rock!;I am trying to lose a few pounds and am on Weight Watchers, these are the best chips around.  I love potatoes and can not keep them out of my diet, these are tasty and low in fat and not drenched in oil.
5;The real thing.;(This review is very similar to one I did for another brand.)<br /><br />Let me start by saying that, while not a snob or connoisseur, I have tried just about every method of making coffee known to humanity.
2;Baby doesn't like it;"I can't get my 10 month old to eat any ""dinner"" type baby food.  I thought this would be different, but it's not."
5;Excellent flavor, best price;I, too, discovered these in Hawaii and craved them when we returned.  I ordered them once from the ML website (which is really Hershey's) and then discovered them available here.
5;They work;I had high LDL 137 after taking benecol it dropped to 107.  May total was 216 it dropped to 191.
5;Our favorite;These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands.
3;Quanty????;This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info.
3;Eehlong;I've been looking for a good low calorie tea as I've been trying to drink less soda. I thought I'd try to find something a little different on Amazon and came across Anteadote.
5;best dry milk;"I backpack often and often take another powder milk but, I always thought it tasted like water. After looking around on the internet and a quick look at my other milks box I realized it was ""non-fat instant milk""."
5;It's working and they love it!;"I switched to Wellness about 2 months ago.  I buy the low cal one for my ""bigger"" girls and the regular Core food for my other dogs."
5;This is why I love Amazon;Obviously, I don't need to write a review about the cereal itself. I would think you already love the cereal if you come searching for it on Amazon.
2;not good;I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.
5;My fave coco!;I don't really like Swiss Miss. I love this brand.
4;very good but too expensive here;$3.69 per box at stop and shop.
1;Protein chips = bleech;The spicy flavoring on the chips is not bad and the chips are nice and crunchy.  The chips themselves though, taste terrible.
5;Quick, cold and yummy!;"I LOVE this tea!  The first thing I do when I walk in the door from work is fill up my tumbler with ice and make a cup.  It's cold and delicious!  I wish they had more varities, but until they do, this is my ""go to"" Vue Cup."
5;The best packaged spanish rice I've ever found;"This is the best packaged spanish rice I've ever been able to find, and I'm guessing I've tried at least 8 or 10 different commercial brands. I find this is virtually identical to the rice at ""real"" Mexican restaurants (except for the tomato bits which naturally aren't as fresh)."
5;best instant noodle;This is the best instant noodle I've ever tried. I like to cook it with some vegetable.
5;great little treat;These treats are made from high quality ingredients, and are made in the U.S.
1;Bad Stuff;This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup. I buy a lot of k-cups this is the by far the worst.
4;Very Pleased;I ordered these for the family so they could have a familiar taste from home.  They were so excited.
5;Best  Brownies;You CAN taste the flaxseed in these whole-wheat muffins and it's a great taste.  Good chocolate flavor and texture.
5;wow;let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more. I have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste I recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky.
5;DELICIOUS:);I was so surprised at the quality of this butter..
5;Excellent!;Very rich in flavor & healthy too. Can't beat that!  It is very tasty & is a complete meal, in a can.
2;Cats stopped eating it pretty quickly;I like Weruva's other flavors, as do my cats, but the Outback Grill variety has a lot of gelatinous filling that the cats don't like to eat.  I end up having to throw out quite a bit of it because they only eat the chunks of fish.
5;My cat loves it;My cat loves it very much.  After she finished her bowel, she would like to sit there and asked me to fill it up for her.
1;Dogs Can't Handle it!;Unfortunately, when I switched my dogs over to this food they had diarrhea for over a month.  Once I change from this food their stool went back to normal.
3;Ok.......;These cookies were ok.  I prefer the plain oreo's.
5;My order isn't here yet .... HURRY!!;As a Sport Nutritionist and athlete, packing healthy meals is daily ritual.  But boy, there are those times when I get caught without .
5;Delicious, another awesome choice by Kind;I have the Fruit and Nut bars quite often, and wanted to try something new.  Read good reviews about these so decided to order some.
5;Great;I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car.
5;SANKA LOVER;IHAVE ALWAYS LOVED SANKA, MAYBE 20 yrs. NOW.
5;Yummy!;Just got these oatmeal animal cookies and we love them!  These are not like a typical animal cracker - they are more like tiny crunchy granola bars!  They remind me of the oats and honey crunchy granola bars from Nature Valley.  Also love the price - the only place I can buy these is Whole Foods and they are .
3;mastifflady;I bought this product for my mastiffs and while is took them a couple of hours to eat it, it only took 20 minutes for my Boston to eat it. I was hopeing that it would last months not minutes or hours.
5;How to make Homemade Wine stay good.;I have been making Home Made Muskadine Wine for over 30 years under the Label Old Fart Vineyards.<br /><br />My secret to keeping it good and tasty is that I cork the bottles with Premium VSI Agglomerated Corks # 9 purchased at Amazon.
5;Very good;It arrived very quickly, was affordable and in good condition. I didn't have ANY problems with the quality, and the receiver was very pleased.
1;Look at the Ingredient List;This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.
5;The Only Gum to Chew;I am very prejudiced for Dentyne Ice Arctic Chill Mint Gum.  Peppermint or spearmint, or another brand just don't do it for me.
5;Delish!;"I'm in love with this! I love it on my frozen yogurt even had it on ice cream when the yogurt was gone LOL I'm not a ""fresh"" yogurt person but it would be good mixed with the fruit too.<br /><br />Just a hint of cinnamon but just right IMO Lots of flax seed so was crunchy enough too."
5;Love it;I love Plum organic pouch.  Got this one on sale.
5;Saveurs Helix Excagrot, 18-count tin;We have enjoyed Escargot made with Saveurs Helix Escargot, 18-count tin for many years.  September 2011 we were in Provence and the French use the same brand.
5;very fragrant cinnamon;I've had several of the Nature's Path pastry flavors and I think this one is my favorite. Whenever I toast one up in the work breakroom there are always comments about what smells so good.
1;Chips Rancid Despite December 2010 exp date;I opened a bag of these chips. I thought I detected a strange odor but put one into my mouth anyway.
4;Good entertainment;My puppy is a big time chewer. We give him his dinner in this a few times a week and it keeps him (and us) entertained.
5;tastes just like rice crispies;I bought these at a store and they were really good.  they are toasted, so they taste a little like Rice Crispies and I tried them because I needed a cracker that didn't have corn in it.
5;Green Tea with Triple Echinacea;I like the flavor of this product (no sweetener or other additives by me) and the benefits of the echinacea has fended off colds since my start of this tea.  Just plain out good for me.
5;Dark Chocolate Ins't Bkfst;This is my favorite breakfast, I love the dark chocolate flavor.  Locally it's impossible to get the dark chocolate except in the variety pack boxes.
4;Jamaican Sorrel;"Another successful Christmas in ""farin"" and I still got to have my traditional Jamaican Sorrel rum punch. This is a good deal, and the 2 packs made me about a gallon of sorrel."
2;This is Coffee?;If you put enough creamer in this coffee, it is tolerable.  It does not have a good coffee taste, and I would not buy it again.
5;Decent value for active dry yeast;Mainly I think this product is good value.  Also, there is an advantage to getting active dry yeast as opposed to cake yeast.
5;Proper pasta with a savory sauce;There are several brands of microwavable meals on the market - Dinty Moore, Campbell's, etc - which do not need to be refrigerated, and require you to do no more than unseal the container and microwave it, usually for about 90 seconds.  These Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers are a little more involved, requiring you to add water (which hardly seems an onerous task, but these days, who knows what's considered onerous?) and they take about 5 minutes to prepare.
5;Great product and variety;I like how there is a light fruit flavor to the water, along with no calories. The fruit flavor is not to stong, it just strong enough to give it a pleasant taste.
5;Wellness Salmon;This is a great product for my dogs. They love it and it is grain free for their allergy sensitivities.
4;Good;This are good tasting Me my husband and 2 of our 4 kids like them the other two are not fond of the texture that they have.  But all around they taste yummy.
4;Good Gluten Free Choice;Finding tasty, gluten free foods is not easy. This is particularly true for pasta products.
4;Good start on quality, Great price!;I have 3 terriers and one is an allergy dog. She's got both seasonal allergies and is sensitive to food ingredients.
4;Nice Coffee;This Dark roast coffee taste nice and very close to the expensive nEspresso machine cofee taste from my work.  Like it.
5;Love &lt;
5;Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag;I bought this to spread on top of my breakfast cereal but discovered that you can eat it by the spoonful.  It tastes nutty and is absolutely delicious.
3;Disappointed;I eat popcorn almost every day.  I was disappointed in this one.
5;Excellent Product;I have been plagued by white flies for over a year. Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely.
3;Hibiscus Rosehip Tea,... With a Little Blackberry and Vanilla Flavoring;The ingredient list tells the tale: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural flavor (presumably the vanilla), dried black current (sic) pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.  This isn't blackberry vanilla tea
5;Great product!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;A GREAT SNACK;I really liked this snack bar combination of peanuts and peanut butter.  It is made up of a thin bottom layer of peanut butter topped with just peanuts that does not become too gooey or sweet.
5;Great tasting Green Tea;For its price, I'd have to say that this green tea tastes superb. I usually don't drink my green tea with honey or any other sweeteners.
2;A first;I have bought k-cups from amazon before and this was the first time that I bought the Van Houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. I would suggest that people do not buy these.
5;Fantastic pound cake;This cake tasted better than a pound cake filled with sugar.  I love it.
5;Good Start;Carnation Instant Breakfast has been a quick and easy breakfast for me for many<br />years and it tastes good, too.  When I found it at Amazon, and in the large container, which cost somewhat less, it was a triple bonus.
1;Have a Lindt truffle instead;This tea has a lovely fragrance and comes in an attractive reusable canister.  Unfortunately, the tin's only protection during shipping was a paper envelope with a thin bubble wrap lining, and consequently it arrived dented.
4;Good;I like the size of the bottle the Essentia comes in as it is a 1.5 liter.
4;OrgraN Gluten Free Corn Crisps;These crisps are light and crisp with a slight corn taste, not as much as corn chips, but recognizable.  They make a great addition to any gluten-free pantry since they will be good served with many spreads, etc.
4;The greatest chocolate!;This organic dark chocolate with currants and hazelnuts is fantastic.  I wish the hazelnuts weren't chopped up so fine.
5;A FEAST FOR THE HOLIDAYS;This is a HUGE and wonderful tasting roast. I't comes in a reusable foam container with dry ice and has a neat burlap bag around the roast.
3;dogs love it;My two dogs love this treat/toy.  With the first dog, a pointer, it can last for days and she loves going back to it.
1;Timothy Defective K-Cups continue;There are several older complaints in this and other forums about defective Timothy's K-Cups.  We purchased the 50 unit multi-pack recently and 30%+ are defective.
5;Too Expensive !;This is a classic candy bar. I love this candy and probably rate it among the best.
5;The Best Ever;These are my favorite crackers by far.  They taste great alone or with toppings, are low sodium, cholesterol free and low fat.
5;YUMMY!!;I didnt think these chips would be that special, but I am game for anything once. Man was I pleasantly suprised, these chips are addicting and now I am hoarding them from the family, (not really) but the thought has crossed my mind.
5;Fave dog food - Helps with allergies too!;We have a picky eater who has allergies.  A friend of our clued us in to the fact that dogs with allergies could have problems with grain in dog food.
4;Hard to find in local grocery store;My husband loves this cereal..
5;He loves them!;This is the second time that I have purchased these rawhide rolls. My dog just loves them .
5;Mild and Pleasant.;A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow.
5;Chocolate Salvation!;"I was willing to give up bread, cookies, pasta, and even fruit for a time, to go low-carb with this new way of eating to improve my health and lose weight. But I was NOT willing to give up my chocolate, thank you! In doing research for a book I'm writing, I had become a bit of a ""chocolate snob."
4;GREAT smelling, fine tasting cereal;When you open the box on these Cinnamon Roll Mini-Wheats Bites you will go crazy!  The smell of these is fabulous.  I would give the smell alone 5 stars.
3;Over charged shipping;"Product was great, it just cost ""WAY"" to much to ship this little pack of gum, never agaion.."
2;My favorite chocolates....except they are melted when I got it;I love chocolate filled with liquor and the Mon Cheri itself does not disappoint. It is the seller and the problematic packaging that gives me the urge to rate it 2 stars.
1;Didn't buy it;I just don't understand how these guys are trying to sell 120 bars in bulk for 115 dollars, while Amazon sells 10 bars for 7 bucks. Just buy 12 boxes from Amazon for 84 dollars.
5;Really Good!;The Really Raw honey brand is really good.  I'm trying to lead a more healthy lifestyle and heard about the benefits of eating raw/unprocessed honey.
5;Crumbs! Who cares!!;These cookies are fabulous for making shortbread crumb crusts.  This crust can also replace a graham cracker crust called for in any recipe.
5;very helpful;I have a dog with liver cancer, Vet recommended I give this to my dog, also gave him 6 - 9 months to live, it has now been 16 months and he is still alive, he is 14-1/2 years old, so now I'm thinking he might die of old age before the liver cancer gets him.  Vet says its probably working more than I thought.
2;Too sweet;We bought this to try it but really hate it.  I didn't read the description well enough and realized when we got it that it has artificial sweetners.
5;Dogs come running!;Our two dogs just love these treats.  One old and one younger but both are active.
2;Leaky Product;I love Nutella but these small packages turned out to be terrible. Out of the 96 small packets 21 of them were leaking all over the box.
5;Love this coffee!;I love this coffee! I drink about 2-4 cups a day. I used to be a Starbucks Dark Roast fan but Lavazza's won me over! I'm not a connoisseur, but I use a drip coffee maker and it tastes great.
5;Organic Dog Food;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;Win some, lose some;I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle.
3;Cinnamony Xylitol;The flavor is more of a minty / menthol cinnamon. Personally, I prefer straight cinnamon, though it's okay when you get used to it.
5;YUM!;My whole family loves these almonds. We're buying a pack of 12 about once a month.
4;Everlasting depends on the dog!;I have two dogs that both like this toy. I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.
5;Zoe Olive Oil;I subscribe to this product and really like it.  It has a good flavor and food cooks well in it.
5;Five stars for Brent and Sam's;These cookies are my favorites. They are full of chocolate chips and pecans.
5;Delicious!;I ordered these based on the reviews. I'm glad I did.
1;Not even close;Trying to find an alternative to the excellent, but hard to find and expensive, Cafe Escapes Chai Latte. This is horrendous.
5;cherry;wild cherry lifesavers are the best. BUT, they are so hard to find in stores except in Florida which is not where I live.
3;Tasty, but...;Overall, I like the way this granola tastes. It has a good ratio of granola-to-chocolate, and the chocolate tastes good.
5;Excellent for cats with allergies;I have an 8 year old cat from a shelter (had her since she was 2 years old) she has allergies which made her eyes crusty (probably the reason she was in a shelter) I spent hundreds of dollars on vets, got medications and prescription food, but this is what work for her..
5;success;My fussy spoiled mutts really like this food.  Not made in USA is a worry but so far so good.
5;Versatile and delicious soup base;Several years ago, my local grocery store carried this soup base.  I can no longer find it locally, so was delighted to find it for a resonable price at Amazon.
5;Great in baked beans!;"When thinking about growing up in NW Ohio, food seemed to be the most remembered. Home made food, not that ""Happy Meal"" junk."
5;I feel good about giving my dog this product;My dog is 14 years old with many health problems. He is fussy about his food, but this is one that he will consistently eat.
5;Caribou Coffee Is Amazing;I really enjoyed this coffee. I am new to the whole K-Cup thing and these were really good.
5;Dark chocolate with Stevia;I was pleasantly surprised at how good the chocolate is. We ate some straight up and put the rest into the best chocolate chip cookies ever.
4;Very versatile products;I like this product but was dissappointed that I could not find all flavors in the plastic container with the shaker top. Regardless, I use them for flavoring drinks, on fish,chicken and on salads.
1;Disgusting flavor and after-taste;"How a supposed Swiss company can create and call this ""coffee"" is inconceivable to me.  Gevalia's Cafe Crema is acceptable, but this stuff doesn't even qualify as coffee in my book."
5;Buddy Berries;My dog loves these little treats.  We put them in a kong before we leave the house and it keeps him busy while we are gone.
2;useless - I feel no effects whatsoever;I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.
5;Great Taste - No Caffeine;This is a great tea for any time of the day - but I partcularly enjoy it in the morning. I love the mix of flavors - a touch of spice and a touch of citrus - and it is decaffeinated so I can enjoy it anytime.
5;Unbelievably delicious and ADDICTIVE!!;I found this product on a US Airways flight and have been HOOKED ever since.  It's actually very good for you, not too high a sugar content.
2;Tastes ok, but instants clog Keurigs;"It wasn't until my Keurig got ""backed up"" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the Keurig or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged."
5;Great product;I am really satisfied with this formula, my baby's digestion is perfect. We've got scared with the Organic Similac right after the recall.
1;That's what she said;This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it.
1;Wild Planet Canned Salmon;The label on the can says..
3;Decent coffee;"As the description says: this is for single-serve ""pod"" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee."
2;Too bitter;I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand  and cheaper price I went for it.  Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used  almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup.
5;It's so easy and so great tasting;You will throw out your microwave corn after trying this product.  This is the closest thing you will find to Theatre Popcorn at home.
5;Tea Sip;Twinings Lady Grey Decaf Tea is a delightful tea to sip anytime of the day or night.  I drank Earl Grey Tea for years but find this new tea more enjoyable.
5;Great gift for kids;These lollypops are from Spain and they taste so much better than the ones in the States. It was not easy to find this wonderful set, but the container is a classic and for the price, you get 100 units for basically 20 cents each.
5;Fantastic;I discovered Ambrosia custard while in Ireland and absolutely love the subtle taste and smooth texture.  Ambrosia is a great light dessert when looking for something with minimal sugar, and the taste better than Birds, imo.
5;reminds me of the chocolate mint Girl Scout Cookies, but  with less sugar.;Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
5;Used as decoration on cupcakes.;I used these as decorations on cupcakes for my son's birthday. They looked great but note they only fit as actual rings on little fingers.
5;"No more ""stinkies""";"I initially ordered Sojos Complete Dog Food Mix to eliminate our French Bulldog puppy Boogie's ""stinkies"". Post research my boyfriend read that raw diet is the solution to ""stinkies""."
5;delicious;this stuff is wonderful.  Nice and sweet.
1;Smells like pipe tobacco;Basically, there is something wrong with this product. It has an aroma of pipe tobacco, and the packaging is incorrect.
4;and in not-so-blind taste testing, our consumer picked....;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages."
5;good for humid weather;My 2 cats usually prefer Fresh Step litter (I buy that at Costco), but in our extrememly humid months it gets too clumpy to be tolerated.  After researching various crystals and their prices, I bought these from Amazon.
5;YUM!;These are the best chocolate cookies, bar none!  Even though they're Gluten-Free, they are SO tasty!  VERY chocolate-y.  A little crumbly, so you have to catch the crumbs, but SO well worth it.
5;excellent coffee and great price;I have bought these Tiger K cups for My Kuerig coffee maker and it sure is a good price, good shipping time and great taste! I not only would buy again..
5;Crepe Myrtle Bonsai a suprise gift.;My sister loved the Bonsai plant This was a gift that she should have received last year but I attempted to order too late in the season. This time I got it right.
5;Fine quality, great price.;We have no complaint about these. We get the 5 lb bag and keep it in the freezer taking out what we need every so often to another container and then resealing.
5;Wonderful, original, elegant and fun product;
5;strong aroma, decent flavor, but not great;Really liked that it is grittier than most, so it is easier to pour and scoop out, but leaves a slight residue when dissolved in liquid. Probably fantastic for cookies or sauces.
4;My dog love it;This is a very fun toy for my dog. He loves the treats inside, but he can get them out very fast.
5;BEST CHICKEN BROTH EVER!;This is the best broth I have ever tasted. It's as good as homemade and a lot easier to make.
5;Yummy!;"I have tried many flavors of ""Special K"" Bars  and like them all. However, the raspberry cheesecake is my favorite followed by Chocolatey Chip Cookie."
1;Taste like burnt something or other.;I'm sorry, but these are horrible!  They taste burnt!  They are so bitter that neither my husband or I were able to eat them.  I tried them three different times because I didn't want to give up so easily, but they really are just awful.
4;Medium to Mild Breakfast blend.;This is a good mild to medium morning coffee. We offer this as an option in the office, along w/Peet's dark roast, and Kreugers flavored single serve.
5;YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!;This is the best vanilla chai you will ever have. we mix it up with milk and pour it over ice in the summer and have it warm like hot chocolate in the winter.
5;Good stuff.;I got this product for my girlfriend as she has had trouble getting a good sourdough starter going. She prepared the mix as instructed and it was bubbling in no time.
5;Delicious;Seller shipped this product fast and I received it well-before christmas.  Pies were fresh and delicious.
4;Convenient and bold.;I first bought this product because I work long hours in clinic and often am unable to go out and grab a fresh cup of coffee.  While it does not replace fresh brewed it does have a much bolder flavor than many of the other instant coffees available.
5;Greenie Clean!;My dog loves these, This was an awesome price too! These are sometimes 40 bucks at the stores for a 27 pack. I will def buy these again.
5;CET Dog Chews;My dog loves them and our Vet recommends them to help keep his teeth clean.  The product arrived on time and as described in great condition.
5;THE KIND;If you buy one tea, buy this one:  PG TIPS.  It is the workhorse, the best of the daily drivers, the most satisfing all round bagged tea I have ever had.
5;The Best Crackers Ever!;These are my all time favorite crackers. They're so delicious that they can actually be addictive.
5;tasty, filling, and guilt free;Vitamuffins taste good, are healthy, have a lot fiber, and are low in fat and calories. It's rare to find this combination of traits.
5;Incredibly aromatic and flavorful;This is as close to Earl Grey perfection as one can hope from a tea bag, and at ~$.13/ea, an incredible value.
5;the best cookie ever;I had Tim Tams while traveling in Australia & New Zealand this summer.  This is the best cookie you will ever eat.
5;Very good;I was used to pick Chamomile flowers for tea myself years ago.This tea reminds me of the quality of home made chimmile tea.
5;Good coffee, fits Senseo machine!;Very tasty, strong and fits in my Senseo!!  2 pods in the large basket to make a mug of coffee, just like the Senseo brand pods.  I'll definitely be re-ordering this!!  MUCH better than the Wolfgang Puck brand.
4;VERY ECONOMICAL;I had been using two packets of Wholesome Organic Stevia per<br />cup of coffee and liked the taste but not the cost.  So I<br />tried the NOW Better Stevia organic powder.
5;CHICKEN WRAPPED DOG BISCUITS;MY THREE DOGS LOVE THESE CHICKEN WRAPPED BISCUTS.  IT'S EXPENSIVE TO PURCHASE THE SMALL PACKS FROM GROCERY STORES.
5;Great Flavorl! Great Price!;I buy this for my husband & also as an occasional treat for my older kids. Since we are a family of 6, the Keurig is not exactly economical.
5;"Tastes just like ""Golden Toasted Cocnut""";"I never did receive this item as ordered and never received a responce from the company on the mix up.  However, the other items ordered from them are superior quality as is the ""Golden Toasted Coconut"" that I recieved instead."
5;Cat begs to clean teeth!;My geriatric cat loves these treats. He begs every time I sit down at my desk (treats are stored in a drawer).
5;Does what they're supposed to do.;Simply a convenient way to supplement salts when needed. For me that's at centuries where the organizers dilute the sport drinks or only have water available.
5;WOW!;I HAVE TRIED THE MANGO COLADA, MANGO MARGARITA, AND GUAVAPOLITIAN, WHICH ALL TASTED SOO GOOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE ARE LOW CALORIE! I RECENTLY JUST TRIED THE KEY LIME MARGARITA, AND MY FRIENDS AND I WERE BLOWN AWAY. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE FLAVORS.
3;good cereal;I've been eating GF for 25 years and Bakery On Main's products have been a godsend for me. I like the Fiber Power GF cereal but I prefer their other GF granola cereals, especially the Apple Raisin Walnut and the Cranberry Maple Nut.
5;Absolutely the yummiest of the Blue Diamond flavored almonds;I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried.
5;Great coffee fast shipping;Great tasting coffee. The shipping was fast and was packaged very well.
2;Eh...;Did not smell as fresh as I had hoped.  My cat was uninterested.
5;PEACH!!!!  :);I hate tea and I LOVE this stuff because I love peach.  I had it at a Bed and Breakfast we stayed at and knew I'd go through the 100 bags in a month, so I bought it.
5;Really good!;I love raspberry shortbread cookies, but they are not easy to find.  These are great - buttery, with just enough raspberry filling.
4;Excellent;By far, my favorite ground coffee. Robust with a slight bitter mocha taste, it is wonderful.
1;Miguel;Maybe I didn't do it right but it didnt work. My dogs sniffed it and that was it.
5;Worthwhile Cherries;I have found that the cherries from Traverse Bay area of Michigan are the best anywhere.  Living in Albuquerque, we cannot get such wonderful cherries locally, so I order them on-line from Amazon/Traverse Bay Dried Cherries.
5;Great Coffee, Beware price has increased!!;This was my go to coffee for the last year.  It is for the most part very fresh (oily shiny beans) I have only received 1 bag that was not fresh and 1 bag that looked like it was accidentaley cut open with a box cutter.
5;Very good tasting candy;I have these, along with the cherry and lemon versions, in a candy dish on my desk at work.  I've had to buy a pound of each type twice now in the last 2 months because they go fast, everyone seems to like them very much (I do too!!).
5;Knorr Bernaise;For years I have used Knorr Bernaise sauce packets with steaks that I found at the grocery store.  I found it to be quite expensive (about $5.
5;THE best honey;"This honey is truly raw! I've purchased honey from farmer's markets, but even they heat it to filter out ""impurities."" However, Wee Bee Honey has a layer of wax, pollen, propolis, all the good stuff that has naturally settled on top of the honey!<br /><br />Also, the texture is delightful! Very creamy and not too crystallized."
5;So easy to use and clean up!;I could not believe how easy this product was to use and so fast!  A whole squash steamed soft as could be in just 15 minutes.  Then blending it to baby food consistency in less than a minute.
3;Koolaid for grownups;From the new line of Crystal Light Moctails, we have the Mojito version.  Little packet of greenish powder, added to water gives you a pitcher full of sweet mojito-ish alcohol free drink.
2;OKAY for Price;With the special deal going on through September 2010, I got these for a little over $1 a piece. The spicing was not the best I've had, and feel the Kitchen's of India, Patak's and Tiger Tiger make better pastes for Indian cooking.
2;grove square coffee for k-cups;This particular coffee had little flavor and generally only worked on the middle setting of the Keurig machine. Sometimes I had to run it a 2nd time using the first button[smallest amount.
5;Easy Brownies;Betty Crocker has done a great job with the 3 items I have tried, the Choc.Chip Cookies, the Brownie mix and the Choc.
5;So delicate & buttery...YUM!;"I was rummaging through our kitchen's lazy-susan-corner-cabinet, looking for something quick, easy & ""of substance"" to eat and noticed 1 lone pack, so I decided to try it.  My mother-in-law must've bought it, 'cause I've never seen the brand before."
5;Mary's Gone Crackers, Black Pepper, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12);Any Mary's Gone are the best crackers on the planet!  Finally a healthy cracker that does not taste like cardboard.  I buy different flavors - they are all good.
5;great coffee;I've tried several and this is my favorite. perfect blend, not too dark.
5;Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea gets two paws up!;Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea is a favorite in our house.  My cats LOVE the taste and I love that it doesn't have any by-products or fillers like corn, wheat or soy.
5;BUY AMERICAN!!;I am ordering these right now, simply because they are grown in the USA.  I am thrilled to buy American and will do so whenever I can.
5;The best K-Cup flavor - Tully's Italian Roast;"Without question the best coffee available for a Keurig brewer! Consistently delicious! This box of 50 only lasts about one month in our home and this is not the only K-Cup flavor we purchase! <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great chili from a can...;Or from scratch for that matter. The turkey is tasty.
3;More can than juice;Think about this before you buy.  I didn't.
5;Great way to stock up......;We have tried every type of packaged Fajita mix we find, and Ortega is the best so far. We had trouble finding it in stock at our local stores so we just bought a couple boxes.
5;Gluten Free done right;I've tried SO many gluten free mixes and this is by far the best. Not only is the texture spot on, but the flavor is lovely.
5;Fantastic flavoured matcha!;I've been meaning to try Matcha again for quite a long time and this is my first foray back into it..
1;Poor delivery & wrong item;This was my second and last order for this item.<br />It took almost three weeks to arrive.
5;YUM!;"We are not a coffee people in the least which made it strange when my husband and I decided to get a Keurig machine. However, we both love that cheap gas station ""cappuccino."
4;My picky dog loves them!;We got these to help clean our dogs teeth and she loves them! One thing I will say though is eventually they kind of dry out and get harder and then my dog will just leave them on the floor. She likes to eat them when they are still chewy, so just make sure you close the bag inside the box fully or they dry out.
4;Healthy but my toddler daughter did not finish it.;I know this is advertised for 6 months on but I figured since my toddler daughter (20 months) eats other snacks out of a pouch. I would give this a try.
5;super pez;These were perfect for our super hero party! It saved me tons of time trying to find each hero. Candy was good too - not old and rock hard.
5;Looks like tropical fish food but my dog woofed it up;My dog's nickname is Hoover and he performed true to form with this treat. It has a small tablet like form and is like a large fish food pellet.
5;Hard to review;This one is a hard review to write because my cats love the food and I do think it is a top quality one, but I won't be buying it from Amazon again.  Don't get me wrong, I have done business with Amazon for over 2 decades and the very few problems that have come up, have always been solved to my satisfaction.
4;While I prefer the red Lavazza for a drip machine, this is perfect for my espresso needs.....;Guys:<br />Although the price recently went up, I received this 4-pack for $12 shipped (using Subscribe and Save and an Amazon clipless coupon).  Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand.
5;Great dog food. Palatable & good ingredients!;Few things good about this product:<br />1. Made by Wellness.
1;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
5;It's good.;Tried it, it's good. Doesn't mix as easily as I'd like it to, but otherwise, makes a pretty good drink.
4;"For a ""quick"" cup of ""real"" chocolate milk, this is the best. For baking, don't use powder!";OK, so I have and love this stuff for *cocoa* and *chocolate milk* so that's what I'm giving it praise for
5;Best ever Lemon Bar MIx;It was so nice to find these mixes on Amazon.  I have used them for years and over the past few years have had trouble finding them in my area.
5;Fantastic for Protein Shakes!;I drink a lot of protein shakes and am always looking for healthy ways to change them up. This Peanut Butter powder is perfect.
5;Love it!;It's good to have an organic instant coffee that tastes good.  Very simple, less waste in the morning when I can make one cup at a time.
5;Grilled Fennel Ciacco Brand;Tasted this product at a gourmet market in Bainbridge, WA and fell in love..
4;The best coconut water out there;Growing up, I was used to coconut water all the time. While none of the brands selling coconut water are close to the real thing (FRESH coconut water), Zico comes the closest.
5;BEST CHIP'S EVER;I can't get enough of these chips!!! I had my family order them, then spend the extra $60 to ship them to Kuwait while i was deployed. Wish they would ship oversea's or at least to APO AE(hint hint).
5;Rooibos - makes great iced tea, Celestial Makes great Rooibos;African Rooibos with mango - made my Celestial - makes such a great refreshing summer drink, a healthy alternative to carbonated drinks. I use a  couple drops of stevia (also available at Amazon) in it as a sweetener to add a touch of sweetness without adding chemicals or calories.
5;Great flavors and a great value!;We like most of the jelly belly flavors, so I didn't think I would be taking a big risk in ordering these even if we got only a few different beans--as I read in other reviews. Wow! Were we surprised at the great mix! Just one of our three bags had at least 27 different flavors (then I stopped counting), with no particular color predominating.
2;hard and only 3 colors;These candy blocks were much harder than others I have had
5;cat treats;Excellent not only do the treats clean your cats teeth,but are full of nutrients and healthy for your cat.I only have to open the bag slightly before my 5 cats come runing and begging at my feet.
3;I liked it better than my picky dogs do;I believe this to be a perfect dog treat and have great respect for everything that Newman's Own Organics does. Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed.
5;NO GOOSE EGG HERE;DELICIOUS, CONVENIENT SIZE, LESS SODIUM, LOW PRICE, AND EASIER TO USE THAN LITTLE SQUARE CUBES THAT REQUIRE 20/20 EYE SIGHT AND LONG FINGER NAILS TO PEEL. THE FIRST BATCH OF CHICKEN BREASTS I COOKED IN THIS BROTH WERE TENDER AND TASTY.
4;4 Stars for price and taste;I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.
5;delicious;I love this product. The taste is as good or better than real movie theatre pop corn and it is fast and easy to prepare.
5;LOVE THEM;I first bought these at a store and loved them so much I wanted more, then the store stopped selling them. I had every one searching for them even my family up North and no luck.
5;Time for Tea!;I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.
5;I never thought I would  say this;But this Chamomile is the one and only I have ever liked. I can not explain it.
5;Greatly improved my golden's mobility;I began giving my older golden retriever these biscuits after she had a lot of difficulty getting up after a walk-what a big improvement.  She has a lot more mobility.
4;Great food, but pricey;This food is good quality, but very expensive. Helped my dog with his sensitive stomach and so I will continue to use it.
5;Perfet bite sized treats!;These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's.
1;Artificial sweeteners bothered bowels;These gummi bears caused my wife and I terrible gas.  Even 1 small handful was enough to cause an effect.
5;The best almonds on earth!!!;I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.
4;Overpriced;Great food for my cat.  He always looks healthy, sleek, and shiny.
3;not enough berries;This granola tastes great, if you like Chocolate. but if you like chocolate covered berries, this really isn't the thing.
2;Wrong tree and pot and grown improperly;The tree and pot which arrived were not the ones pictured.  Also, the trunk has several indentions and rust spots from where improper wire was left on the trunk too long.
4;Great tea;I really enjoy earl grey this is really good on a cold afternoon. This is a good deal I highly recommend this to someone who enjoys tea.
5;Great Price;I love these oats.  They are hearty and have a bite.
3;The good and the bad;"The Good: Easy to use and the mutt (my sweet Doberman, Zoe Washburne) loves it so much she'll go to the refrigerator and hope I get some out for her.<br /><br />The Bad: And this one is ""my bad"" as I was in a hurry and didn't take the time to check out the shipping costs."
5;Best Tuna on the planet;I truely enjoy this product and consume one can at least once a week.  I like the fact that it is in olive oil which is good for your insides as well as outsides.
5;100 Calorie Pack, Chips Ahoy Cookies;I have recently joined Jenny Craig as  I need to lose some weight, and these 100 Calorie Pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks.  I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably.
3;Faint smelling.;Hi,<br /> Online it says 100% pure lavender oil.  I use lavender oil religously and this does not smell like other pure lavender oils I've recieved in the past.
2;New Formula = bad taste;I was hoping it would not taste as bad as other reviewers descriptions when I purchased it.<br /><br />However, other reviews are right.
2;Great idea ruined by too much salt and MSG;I like Knorr products and have used them for many years.  I just wish they would reformulate them to cut out the MSG and reduce the salt.
5;Coffee from Amazon;I have no problem with Tully's Coffee or any of the coffees presented by Amazon.  I have a problem with ordering coffee through Amazon.
4;Tasty!;This product is just as expected.  I'm new to making my own sushi so I have no experience prior to buying this product.
4;Delicious!;My husband is the coffee drinker so I asked him what he thought..
5;Best tasting anti-nausea remedy;Wife tried all the usual over the counter and prescription anti-motion sickness meds..
3;Count your mini Abba Zabas;I ordered 250 mini Abba Zabas and I received my order when it was expected.<br /><br />BUT when I opened the package and counted the mini abba zabas(I was splitting the order with a friend) I discovered I was short 31 mini abba zabas.
5;Excellent product, excellent company;The product is working exactly as I hoped - and I'm using it for guitars. But, the bigger point was the fantastic customer service the folks at IG provided.
5;Lyons Tea;I love this tea. It is cheaper to get it here then in my local store.
5;Absolutely love it;The chocolate squares are a perfect size. The granola is tasty, too.
5;A GREAT OLD FAVORITE;I have loved this soup for over 60 years, and the can I bought yesterday was terrific the same as always.  I have to admit that I did recently get one can that was very thin with not much evidence of peas.
5;Sugar free;great price, great product. good alternative to Nestley's Quick when you're a diabetic and love chocolate milk or just need something to get you started in the morning when you don't have time for a real breakfast.
3;Only okay;I didn't care for this as a soup, as I found it too salty.  But it works fine as a base for sauce if you experiment with adding other ingredients.
5;Can't go wrong;I have bought all three for my puppy and he loves them all.  He will do anything for this snack and they are good for him too.
5;Excellent and  delicious tasting;Love this product in a snack bar. Good variety of nuts and a treat to eat.
5;Crisp and good flavor;I really like the sea salt and vinegar flavor. To me it tastes better than regular potato chips.
2;Feel Kinda Ripped Off;Because of the bulk price and the main image on amazon, I thought the packages would be larger, like a bag of Jerky. Turns out that the image you see is not the packaging that you get, the bags are shorter and smaller (see my customer image).
5;Mouth watering!;Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies.
4;A great whole grain alternative;This is a hard-to-find couscous in a whole grain form, cannot find it in stores anywhere. It is larger than regular couscous that is like pastina.
5;Even My Meat and Potatoes Husband Drinks These!;I bought these for my husband at WF, because he is supposed to stay away from sugary soft drinks and fruit juices.  We've tried a bunch of sugar free beverages, and this one has been the best.
4;Quality Tea;I would recommend it. Quality pearls and a few make a strong, tasty tea.
5;Wow! See it grow before your eyes!;Got this salad packet since one of my New Year's resolution was to make more healthy/organic green stuff for the family (loose weight).<br /><br />In one day, it started to grow.
5;Incredibly Rich and Delicious Tea!;I absolutely love this tea, it has completely replaced coffee in my home..
1;2 cats: not one bite;Petco had a 20% off sale on this.  I know why.
5;very pleased;I bought this set for my grandparents for Christmas which they loved.  It brought back a lot of memories for them from their childhood.
5;I haven't tried these. Why are they so great?;My daughter is away for college. I can shell out $16 and 2 days later she gets a note saying there's a package for her.
5;Yum!;This is one of those gifts you send to yourself!  And, maybe, of course, EVERYONE else you know!  They really are that good. They use clear sanding sugar on the sugar cookies and boy, well, there just aren't enough cows in the world to get all the milk you need to dunk those things!  Think I'll have to order another tin!  The best part, however, is that they seem to last forever, even though it seems like you've been eating them forever, they take forever to disappear.
2;Flat, dull, lacking in aroma;I received the green pouches as illustrated, and the price for a full pound of tea was very attractive. The Amazon listing currently (Sept.
4;Next best thing to homemade;With my first child I made all of my baby food from scratch.  I was a stay at home Mom and had the luxury to do this, but I know that it's not always possible for parents.
5;gnawing pleasure;I have 2 dogs (mini poodle 11# and bichon frise/mini poodle 12#) and they both enjoy gnawing on these natural antlers.  I feel comforted in knowing that they are not chewing and ingesting the plastic chew toys (going in the recycle bin) anymore but a natural and humanely produced product.
2;It does not taste good;My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy.
1;Moldy!;I just opened this bag of Goji Berries, ate a handful and spit it out.  I emptied the bag onto a paper towel to examine.
5;Great product!  From corn, not birch;If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best. It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.
5;Best Vinergarette on the Market;[ASIN:B001SAXW9C Reily Foods Drssng, True French Vingrt, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)]]<br /><br />I have used this dressing for years and absolutely love it.  I lived in Virginia for many years and was able to purchase it from Food City.
5;Gluten free puffs!;My son is currently on a gluten free diet, so I was happy to find these puffs he can eat. He loves these.
2;Picture does not match product;My dogs loved the the 12 inch bully stick
5;Great tasting!;I received this yesterday and my 5 year old has already drank 3 boxes! We were supposed to take this on our road trip, and now I have to order more since we won't have enough! She is lactose-intolerant and this is a great alternative that doesn't require refrigeration. It doesn't taste like many of the soy milk I've tried and my husband and I enjoy it also! Highly recommend this product.
5;Highest in protein;Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack.
4;Great Cat Food Very Over Priced;I am buying this product because my cat has health issues. While I lived in Indiana I was able to buy it at Walmart for around 11.
5;Best Coffee;This is a great tasting coffee, bold and strong.  K-cups are the best way to ensure a delicious, fresh cup of coffee at any time of the day or night.
5;Great product;The best sauce on the market.  We use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
2;*NOT* real cappuccino!;"If you're expecting a real cup of cappuccino you'll be disappointed. This isn't a creamy, frothy cappuccino, at best it's the same as the powdered ""gas station"" cappuccino you can buy at, well, the gas station."
2;Tastes like ick;I'm not a fan. If you like dense and dry, like a pack of desicated Fig Newtons compressed into a single bar, then Larabars may be for you, but they're not for me.
3;Not the Same as 100% Pure Pumpkin from Libby's;"You might think that this product, LIBBY'S PUMPKIN PIE MIX, is the same as the pumpkin that Libby produces as their <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4;FungusAmongUS;I am happy with this purchase. Shiitake mushrooms are supposed to be a very healthy food, and these 1 oz packages make it easy to keep a supply on hand.
3;Nothing crazy;Besides the fact that this coffee is really dark and bitter there is nothing more to say about it.  Great price though and I wanted to try it out so it's not bad.
4;good way to try yerba mate;I purchased this at my local supermarket for somewhere between $5 and $6. It's a good way to try yerba mate, especially if you don't have an infuser.
5;excellent;This is a wonderful kit. They ferment out quickly.
3;Too many rancid ones;I really like hazelnuts.  I ate some of these raw, partially baked, and fully baked, but the same percentage bad nuts.
5;Great Taste!!!;Love this snack.<br />Its really tasty.
5;Friggen Cherries!;What a great value for these cherries. They're a perfect snack for lunches, just thrown 1 ounce into a tiny tupperware and you're good to go.
5;The Best;This is simply the best non-flavored coffee in K-cups that I have tried.  I drink my coffee black and this has an excellent coffee aroma and taste.
2;Good product stuck in a horrible box renders it difficult (at best!) to even use.;I agree with the other reviews--great product.<br /><br />BUT, when the product is packaged in a box so useless, i wont ever buy again.
5;Great product.;Great product.  Buddy likes all the Cesar flavors but the gourmet filets are his favorite.
5;This salt will change your life;Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.
5;Cook it literally;This spice blend means we give you the best we got.  Zamouri is one of the most reliable and expert of shops on the web.
5;A small price to pay for making our cat this happy!;These were bought as somewhat of a gag Christmas gift for our cat..
5;All I have to say is Hell Yeah!!!!;I have been searching the web for months looking to order No Fear with no luck at all! Amazon finally sells this stuff! I am clueless as to why in the world Pepsi would buy this product from Sobe and then discontinue it?!?!?!? It is without a doubt the best energy drink ever made! Doesn't taste like cough syrup or liquid candy like all the others and it doesn't make you bug out of your mind! The perfect taste with the perfect amount of energy! I am so sad they don't make it anymore! Seriously, when I am on road trips I stop in and out of gas stations and grocery stores buying up all the product that is out there..
5;The Best Rice Ever !!;This is my very favorite rice!!  The only one I would ever think of mail-ordering and going to all that trouble.  Flavorful, nutty, chewy yet soft, great texture, cooks up easily and goes well with everything!  You will love it.
5;Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH;"I'm normally rather ""meh"" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g."
5;life saver;our 9 month lab loved them.  giving him a pill could be easier.
5;Yummy and Healthy!;These fruit ropes are innovative and delicious. Even though they are marketed as a child's product, they truly are great for kids of all ages! I enjoy them as much as my grandchildren.
5;Great pod coffee;I received this trial coffee pod and the bonus was the organic part of this product.  I heated up a 10 oz of hot water and placed this pod in the hot water.
5;I recommend these to everyone;I have been gluten free for over 4 years and over the years have tried a lot of different brands and products.  Over the years I have met people through work or friends that have been told that they had to stay away from Gluten and have asked me for help.
5;Mona Lisa;I love the flavor of the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. To me it has a very rich aroma.
3;Just OK: Strong Coffee, Bitter Aftertaste;I prefer strong coffee with a smooth taste.  Tully's French Roast is strong but has a bitter aftertaste that only goes away if you use half-and-half (the bad coffee transformer).
3;Good taste - Bad Price;These crackers are delicious. They are a bit sweeter than I hoped for, but still, really tasty and crunchy.
5;Great cake mix!;I am gluten, dairy, soy and corn intolerant and have had to avoid these foods for some time now. I haven't had cake in 2.
5;delicious;tastes so much better than quaker, i can't even eat that stuff any more, it tastes like boiled paper. these have nice thick, chewy texture.
4;Sweet and crunchy;I was surprised how sweet this cereal was, although it held up its crunchiness very well right down to the last flake. The honey taste was prominent, however I really couldn't taste the peanuts.
5;Full bodied flavored decaf!;This product has become my coffee of choice after trying many other brands.  It is full bodied without being bitter.
5;Xylitol sweetened Gum.;Good product! If you are set on chewing gum this is the stuff. You can feel the difference, teeth stay cleaner between brushings.
5;watch run out date;My kids were so excited to get this in the mail.  We make hot chocolate now with our keurig and they were missing the marshmallows these work great.
5;salt of the earth;This wonderful sea salt is both beautiful and healthy for you. It takes less to season.
5;Amazingly Good;Although I detest most reduced-calorie dressings, I like the Walden Farms Ranch dressing.  I have no idea how this can have zero calories.
5;BEST SAUCE EVER!;And I don't mean just for Asian sauces.  This is easily the best sauce ever!  I put it on everything.
5;Lindt has ruined their 70% bar -- let's hope they leave this one alone!;"I've been eating Lindt EXCELLENCE 70% chocolate bars for years, but in the fall of 2010 they began adding emulsifiers to the chocolate which ruined the taste, texture, and overall quality of the product.  Now that I can no longer scrounge up the older versions of the 70% bars (the ones without the red banner reading ""NEW RECIPE""), I tried the 85%."
4;Just showed up today! 8/19/2011 NOT 8/11 you listed;I'm happy to report that Amazon found out what happened to my order and my Yummy Earth pops were waiting at the door for me.  I received 320 pops and my flavors seemed to be exact @ 40 of each of the following flavors.
2;Cherry Syrup;I tried the product since I can no longer eat sugar thinking it would be a good substitute. It tasted too heavy and too sweet I did not enjoy the product and will not purchase again.
5;excellent;The best whisky sour ever !! Instant hit with all. Gets done in a jiffy.
1;Not good for cats - too hard to eat;"With all due respect to Amazon reviewer ""Book and Dog Lover"", I can't imagine any cat would enjoy these treats.  Because they're freeze-dried, they are too hard for a cat to chew without an incredible amount of effort."
4;Knorr's;The product worked just fine and was a necessary part of a receipe we used. The timing of getting the product was not just fine.
5;Kombucha;It was nice to have all the ingredients to start the kombucha. Fast delivery.
4;Bright, clean black cherry taste;I was a little leery of trying this product, partly due to the fact that I am not a particular fan of anything that is a cherry flavor, even something that claims to be the juice of cherries.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, and am now a fan of this drink.
5;The come back kid snack...;I first offered these to my little guy at about 6mos. He enjoyed them, but wasn't crazy for them.
4;Jar shape.;The only thing I do not like about the product is the shape of the bottle. It makes getting all of the sauce out of it impossible.
5;Great licorice;I don't know what other reviewers received, but it certainly wasn't the same quality of allsorts that I received.  These are great!  And they are also a good value.
3;A good but not great mix;I like this product because it's a powder that keeps for a long time and is packaged for individual servings. However, the flavor is not as good as liquid mixers or homemade.
2;So-so reaction from a picky dog;These were on sale at Petco, so we gave them a try. They're too big to give for frequent clicker treats with my 35 lb dog.
5;GREAT Snack;I highly recommend these berries. The sweet and tart flavor is unique and delicious.
5;YUM!!;I love this product!  We have replaced all other butter and cooking oils with this..
5;Smells so good and the cat loves it!;My cat went into mourning when our dog died and wouldn't eat, so my friend gave me a tin of this to try and that got her back on track. So, I ordered more and boy, did she love it.
5;Very easy to brew, tastes and smells great, could be sweeter;Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Blackberry Vanilla<br /><br />These pyramid tea bags are quite functional by allowing the contents to release their flavoring more consistently and fully. Upon opening the box, I could smell the berries and vanilla which did not dissipate while brewing the tea.
5;Very Delicious;The noodles are very delicious and they make great Thai dishes. They cook quickly and easily.
5;One of the best!;I really don't have much to say but that this is the best purchase I've made in over five years.  The flavor is out of this world and it doesn't have a bad odor like some of the idiots who have stated it in other reviews.
5;Good healthy dog treat;I am impressed with the quality of these dog treats.  Amazon seems to sell these treats for the best price and I will continue to order these in the future.
5;Mom;My mother in law used this product to make a dish that is like a wild rice dish.  I have brought it to many family gatherings and it has always been a hit.
5;Love it!;I have a female German Shepherd Dog that is now 16 mos old.  Since we got her at 11 wks old, she has been on a lot of different dog foods.
5;Great wine kit;I've been making wine from packaged wine kits now for several years and when I saw the Chateau Classico kits on Amazon for $85 I had to try one.  First of all, $85 for a 16 litre red wine kit is a great deal and it comes complete with labels, real corks, and foil caps.
5;Wonderful cheese;
5;Tasty;A must for anyone who loves to cook.  This sauce along with the Raspberry Chipotle are so tasty and add a nice twist to spice up otherwise boring chicken and steak.
5;With Veggies;I love this spice mix, to blend with sugar and salt for edamame!  Great side dish, great snack.  Highly recommended.
5;A great, comprehensive starter kit;This kit comes with pretty much everything you need to get started in the molecular gastronomy world.  You get 50g of each additive, which is just about perfect.
1;AWFUL!!;"Do not be fooled by the ""British Blend"" label, this is not British tea! We Brits like our tea with a lot of flavour. I frequently purchase Tetleys decaf tea in the UK and this does not even compare."
5;Good Stuff!;I am so happy that I purchased this cat food because my cat absolutely loved it  I gave him half the can for his first meall and the rest later, which really saved me money. I'll definitely purchase more in the near future.
2;WARNING: Contains sulfites;I am extremely sensitive to MSG, sulfites, etc. - they give me terrible migraines.
4;Great! Better alternatives!;I like this product a lot. Also look up El Maestro Muscovado on ebay! Their products are awesome as well.
5;Really Excellent Chai!;This is hands down the best chai blend I've ever tasted.  The black tea is excellent quality and the spices are very well balanced.
5;Item 5 star.  Shipping 0 star!;Ordered this product based on reviews and am not disappointed.  It clears the clutter from my counter but the K-cup selection is at our fingertips.
5;Satisfied customer;i really enjoy this syrup. It has a wonderful flavor and I will purchase again.
5;Excellent Dog Food: Excellent Price (AVP);I would have spent the big bucks to order top-rated Blue Buffalo, but was shocked to learn that there was a recent wholesale recall of Blue Buffalo products. Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious.
1;Hugely disappointing!;This is a super rich cake --1.5 sticks of butter, 3 eggs, and an additional 3 tablespoons of butter for the topping.
5;Our Mastiffs Approve;These wafers are great.<br /><br />Sensitive stomach's of our mastiffs approve.
5;Yummy;I love chocolate covered almonds. And these were awesome.
4;Mild and Flavorful;My husband I both like a mild tasting coffee.  We thought we would give Wolfgang Puck Breakfast in Bed a try.
1;The Salt & Pepper version is awful!;We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.
4;So Tasty!;My only problem with this lip balm is that it tastes so good I lick it off! If you like coconut anything you'll love this!<br /><br />I love that it's made with 100% vegetarian ingredients and is never tested on animals. The ingredients are also 82% certified organic, which is a nice plus.
3;Good alternative to potato chips, but very salty!;After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste.
5;My dogs love these.;These are sticks with ribs protruding.  I am going to use the same review I did for another ZOE product, because it is as true for this product as it was for the other one:<br /><br />I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.
5;Skippy peanut butter;The best peanut butter ever, very crunchy.  Wish it came in a large size.
5;Twinings Darjeeling Tea;This 50-count box offered by Amazon is a great value. This wonderful tea is not as strong as English Breakfast and has a slightly flowery scent and a pleasant taste.
3;Oh god;This cereal is like crack for me. Very sweet, and I could eat half the box in one sitting if I had no self control.
4;Quite tasty and crunchy health snack;If you never have tried Kind healthy grains products the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds would be a good one to try. The Kind line is all natural with nothing artificial.
4;A very good malt, but you do have to use a lot;I've been looking for malt for a very long time, it is pretty hard to find it stores, so I finally ordered this. My only problem with it is that I have to use a lot if I really want a malty taste.
4;With Zinger Ice Tea Summer Never Has To Be Over!;I know it is October and summer is officially over but this tea is good year round. Now it is sweetened with stevia but I think it is not quite sweet enough so I add another packet of stevia.
2;Gross;"Tasted artificial, weird, unnatural.  Could not detect the orange peel ""note"" at all."
5;Awesome!;This, in my opinion is one of the best coffee's made.  The flavor is not overpowering and has a nice aroma.
4;Love this stuff!;I haven't purchased this item here, I get it at my local grocery, however, I love the stuff.  I do not use it as BBQ sauce though.
5;Fabulous;"Don't be afraid of ""no image""-these are a satisfying salty crunch which I generally need if I stay up past bedtime (!) and dont want to eat something serious that late at night. Each color, orange/carrot, beige/potato, sage/spinach has a delicate flavor of their veggie."
5;Delicious;best lunch ever- under 1 minute, can eat it at my desk, has fresh sauce, tastes good, and is all vegetarian. Yum.
3;Good but not great;Definitely not a generic box of chocolate that you buy from your grocery, but I wasn't too impressed otherwise.  Many pieces, the chocolate covering was just too thin.
5;My cats love it;I have 18 cats at home..
5;Best cookies around!;I have always loved Vienna Fingers cookies, find them a great comfort food. To me, they are a step above Oreo cookies except they are vanilla.
5;Heaven;This is without a doubt the best honey in the world.  Try it alone or with Stash Ginger peach green tea, or anything.
2;Good while it lasted ... but it didn't last!;I started feeding my chocolate lab his dinner in this toy and it worked well.  I really enjoyed watching him figure out how to dump this kibble out and he seemed to enjoying the challenge of getting every last piece out.
5;Madagascar vanilla bean paste;All I have to say is I will never buy anything other than this paste. It is so delicious in Anything u use it in.
5;Great gum!;Hands down, one of the best gums on the market, if you like peppermint. When I offer to someone whose never tried it before, they go bonkers.
3;Thoughts from an experienced illy drinker;"A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;Nah.;You know, I have to say I wasn't impressed much by this stuff.  I'd like to say otherwise, but I'd might as well be honest.
5;My yorkie goes nuts for it;My yorkie is crazy about this peanut butter. We fill his Kong toy up every time we need to leave him in the kitchen and he scarfs it down.
5;wonderful product;I was thrilled to find this product because I only use whole wheat flour.  I have baked with it several times and  the products have be great!  This is the only WW flour that I will use from now on.
5;Sempio does it again with another great product...;This vinegar is my new favorite rice vinegar for sushi making. This is unseasoned, naturally fermented brown rice vinegar.
5;My second bag from here.;It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body.
5;love these!;Price is right (especially for organic) and the baby loves them. I make the rest of his food, but it's not worth it for me to make his pureed prunes, especially since it's hard to find organic ones.
3;Pretty good, but not pest free.;The tree came very well packaged and in fair condition considering it had just been in a box for a few days. However, after further inspection, I discovered that it not only had sow bugs and a baby millipede in the soil, it also had a minor case of spider mites.
4;These things rock...;These chips are simply excellent.  SO delicious!  I'd give them five stars if it weren't for the fact that they're so high in sodium.
1;Yuck;Not tasty. Not really even edible.
5;Kid loves it;My toddler son LOVES this stuff.  I mix it in with a half milk, half kiefer drink and he sucks it down like there is no tomorrow.
5;delicious;the rotini & zesty marinara healthy choice fresh mixers are delicious..
5;GREAT STUFF;THis is the BEST VANILLA I have ever used ..
3;Occasionally moldy but otherwise good;We used to buy the canisters of these until they disappeared from retail stores.  They were addicting but later became hit-and-miss.
5;Tasty, and healthy!;Tastes good, strengthens enamel (at least that's what my dentist told me!).<br /><br />I've had a piece of this gum in my mouth for 6+ hours without it turning into a gooey gross mess as most other brands of gum will.
5;Yummy!;I grew up eating these when I lived in Germany.  They are truly my obsession!  These are the originals
4;Stop the Press!;"OMG!  This oil is waaaay better than I expected.  I used it the wrong way the first time, ""Duuuh!""  putting it on top of the popcorn instead of using it as the popping oil (I'd gotten used to using Grapeseed oil)."
5;The Main Attraction;I have used 100% durum whole wheat pasta for many years, but have always purchased by price rather than brand name. Until now spaghetti was something to hold a good sauce.
2;So that's why they call it Holy Basil!;I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.
5;Dog's favorite;Our golden retriever has so many allergies.  These treats fit the bill.
5;excellent pasta;I absolutely love this pasta.  Not available locally for me.
5;"Quite tasty. Be aware of 8min ""wait time"" [somewhat optional]";This is a fairly simple product review.<br /><br />I like the soup quite a bit.
5;EXCELLENT PACKAGING AND EXCELLENT TASTE;I USE THIS PRODUCT TO BAKE COOKIES FOR MY HUSBAND.  HE HAS TO HAVE LOW SUGARS AND ALMOND MEAL FLOUR IS THE BEST FOR DIABETIC BAKING.
5;Tastes Great;This popcorn tastes great. The only complaint I have is that it is way too salty (and we like salty).
5;Excellent coffee at a reasonable price;I have tried the Columbian k-cup and must say it is the best I have found to date, I have owned my Keurig brewer for about 1 yr and have found Brooklyn Bean coffees to have good verity and reasonable price. Customer service is excellent.
5;Aero Gardens are just so much fun and truly wonderful.;I've loved everything about this product.  I've bought 2 of them and always have some fresh herbs, peppers, or flowers.
5;My Favorite Decaf;I drink only flavored caffeinated coffee.  I sampled about 24 flavors of k-cups and have narrowed my favorites down to 6.
4;Crumbly goodness;Perfect, healthy, world-conscious snack. The cookies can be a bit crumbly, but the taste overrides this fact.
5;Great and good price!;I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.
1;Nasty;This is the first time I have tried any Walden Farms products. If the rest are as bad as this Peanut spread I am not interested in anything they make.
5;Best Flavored Coffee...;I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15 - 20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.
3;Flavor is okay;With the chocolate and vanilla stevia, I like to make a non-caffeinated hot beverage.  Stevita brand is almost as tasty as Sweetleaf brand, which I had used previously.
5;My Dogs LOVE these Cookies;I have 2 rescued MiniPoodles: Leo and Shannon.  When I initially got them it was obvious Shannon had severe allergies, which in turn limited both the FOOD and the cookies I could give her.
5;Good flavor;I ordered this flavor when I saw it was on Amazon, as most stores in my area do not carry it, and only carry Chicken, Beef, Shrimp and Oriental flavors. I guess there isn't enough demand for other flavors which is sad because the ones Ive tried that they used to have are way better than just Chicken and Beef.
5;WolfGang Puck Coffee Pods;This is the best coffee that I have found for my Black & Decker one cup coffee maker.  When Foldgers quit making pods, I thought I wouldn't be able to find a coffee that I liked (Senso was horrible).
5;Be Warned...;These things are amazing.  I can't eat less than half a can at a sitting.
4;stays crunchy in milk;This cereal is delicious with milk.  Not so much straight out of the box though.
2;Yuck!;The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture.  It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it.
1;Contains SPLENDA - yuck;"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this."
5;Great Tea!;This tea is absolutely wonderful.  I usually stick to plain black tea, but this double spice is really good.
5;great food;my baby loves it,<br />high-end dog food,<br />would be nice if more pet food stores had them in stock<br />would've be nice if common American pet food would have concern of quality as well..
1;Too much sugar;There is more sugar in this product per ounce than coca-cola. The same is true for the Vanilla version and I imagine the choc too.
3;Very Small, Dog wouldn't eat it!;I was shocked at how small this container was!  It is costly for the size.  I gave a taste to my dog and he played with it, dropped it, and only ate it when the other do came around to investigate.
5;Fantastic grain free treats!!!;Considering the fact that these treats are grain-free, and have high quality ingredients, the price makes sense. You always pay more for better things, right? I love that these treats aren't full of things I cannot pronounce.
5;Will Order More;Now, I must state my opinion as a woman whose weight has gone up and down over the past 15 years. Unfortunately I am on the upper end again.
4;My dogs love Greenies!;My dogs get one greenie everyday.  I like that they offer a lite version.
5;Greenies Pill Pockets;My miniature schnauzers have had an assortment of pills to take over the years and the Greenies Pill Pockets have made my life a whole lot easier and my doggies very happy.  Giving a pill is a breeze now with pill pockets.
2;Not good;Normally, I do not use this type of product, but, thanks to Amazon, I had an opportunity to try it.  I kept my mind open as I did not know what to expect, and the picture on the box looked appetizing.
5;Perfect for mini schnauzer;First let me say that every time i read some of the dog food recipes on the labels i begin to think that there are real bits and pieces of fish in the bag. lol but no.
5;Mrs. May's Almonds make my days!;This is a great product.  We tried it at the beach the first time and loved it.
1;Chocolate Orange too dry.;I thought these were way too dry AND the nuts seemed to cut my mouth.  That combination turned me off to these bars completely.
3;Tastes great but it's instant;These cups are a great choice if you would like something different than regular coffee.  It tastes and looks like General Foods International Coffees, rather than real coffee.
5;My dogs never throw up any more!;I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own<br />#0174
5;Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!;Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.
3;Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds;I had trouble finding just the right amount of time to microwave Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds and now that I have they're okay, but I doubt I will buy them again..
5;All That & A Bag of Blair's Habanero Chips;I received these wonderful chips yesterday in the mail, as I had been passively looking for them for quite some time.  They are awesome.
1;Just didn't like it;"Thought I would try Starbucks coffee because I never had it before and wanted to see what all the ""talk"" was about with Starbucks. I just simply did not like it."
5;maxwell house filter packs ground coffee;This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! No measuring, no thinking, no clean up. Yeah! Thank you Maxwell House for the convence of this product.
5;Awesome substitute for milk for my son!;I love this evaporated goat's milk for my son! It is not real expensive, and he loves it. Walmart also sells this, if you would prefer not to pay shipping.
5;If my math is right, it's a good deal;First off - the product itself is delicious.  I have had the bags rip a few times but only when I poke my fingernail through them accidentally or push the plunger in our jug down too hard and rip them.
4;This sauce is super hot.........;I had tried Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce before, and was really impressed with the heat, but not the flavor. So I wanted something with a lot of heat, and a lot of flavor this time.
5;Perfect!;I love this tea. It has a wonderful aroma.
1;Heavily Flavored - Not For Us;I thought this was a Jamaican blend or roast, but turns out it's simply a heavily flavored coffee.  The flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring.
5;Jet Fuel;Great price. Best tasting coffee in the rich, Extra Bold category.
5;I had to stop buying;my wife loves these and was breaking the bank- had to stop buying them.  Great product, good price, but too many of anything is probably not good.
5;So far, so good.;We have been feeding our 3 year old fussy Italian Greyhound this for about 2 years now and it's one of the few canned dog foods he likes. It think it's the sweet potato.
5;Massimo Gusto Avocado OIL;Good,mild tasting avocado oil.Excellent value.
5;Great when your short on time.;When i am stretched for time i pour a bowl of this add some milk let it sit while i get ready for work, after 5-10 mins its just perfect and ready to eat. I also love coming home from a hard day of work and mix this with some yogurt.
2;Not worth it;I ordered 30 of the sleep. I have insominia.
5;Perfect every day coffee.;I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold.
5;Happy baby makes a happy mommy!;My son LOVES the Ella's kitchen line of organic baby foods. By far his favorite has to be the Spinach, Apple and Rutabaga.
3;Great taste but texture clogs my coffee machine;I like the taste of the coconut but I'm tired of cleaning out the funnel of my Keurig with a paper clip.  I wasted a lot of these pricey K-cups because the filter clogs up from the mushy coffee grinds.
5;Honeytree's organic honey.;Excellent!  We are regular buyers when our local beekeepers run out of their own stock.  Good flavor, is always fresh and rarely crystalizes.
5;Tasty tea;I enjoyed this tea just plain, without honey or sugar.  It was tasty and refreshing.
5;Best customer service ever and the quality is great!;Originally, I ordered the Italian Wedding Cookies from Amazon and received a case that was not up to my standards. I don't know if UPS had left them in the hot truck too long or what (maybe I'm just too picky), but they were not exactly as expected.
5;Excellent flavor, no after taste, smooth;I cannot abide plain coffee so I've been sampling all the flavored coffees for our new Keurig machine. Some have just been too strong for me, too bitter, or too chemically tasting.
5;Salmon Dog Treats;Mini Naturals - 1 pound - Salmon Flavored<br />Great product for training dogs!  I use them all the time for training (walking on a lead, sitting, fetching).  They are high in flavor so even with our 7 month Golden Retriever, treats cut in half work well for a reward.
5;Low-Fat Snack, Only Brand my Kids Like;This is the only brand my picky kids like when it comes to pretzels. They do prefer the salted ones which is fine for anyone not having blood pressure issues.
5;Sucked the air right out;It took the air right out of the bottle so fast that I did not believe it was done. When you hear the clicking you know you have pumped enough times.
4;Delicious;When I tried this for the first time, I was mostly just intrigued by the idea of something different. I wasn't disappointed.
5;Loved it!;We ordered a bulk for our staff training day (carnival theme). Everyone loved it! It was especially more affordable than renting a cotton candy machine.
5;Quality Bully Sticks;These are quality, thick bully sticks, unlike some sold by other companies.  My dogs love them and they last for much longer than the few minutes that those of lesser quality last.
5;Puffs Please!;Both my one year old and my 3 year old love these.  We only have tried the Green Puffs, but they are a hit at our house.
4;What a nice change of pace.;A good product.  Very tasty.
5;Tastes great and is Healthy;Best granola going! I eat it every morning with vanilla or plain yogurt. Who says you have to have a pop tart or a doughnut to get a quick breakfast! This has healthy whole grain, healthy nuts (whole, not tiny bits) and healthy fruits.
5;Flavor, Not Color;Forget the color!  This stuff is delicious!  My wife and I bought some at the Hershey factory when passing through last summer and have loved it.  Just can't find it on the shelves here in rural Vermont.
5;CROWD PLEASER;These cashew clusters are delicious.  Two or three of these clusters takes care of any sugar urge.
4;liked it;Disclaimer: I am reviewing a bottle I received for free through the Vine program.<br /><br />Well I liked it.
5;Delicious!;I purchased this to use with my Bialetti Moka, and it is delicious!<br /><br />I like to use 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons in my 6-cup maker, and it makes enough for two (large) lattes.<br /><br />It reminds me of working in Starbucks.
4;Delicious Hot Cocoa;This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.
2;Coffee Rate;The beans were very dry or over roasted.  The flavor was ok but not a great cup in the morning.
5;MUCH BETTER THAN CLAY CLUMPING LITTER BY FAR!;Used to use clumping cheap litter for our 4 month old kitty- was super super smelly and just plan gross and tracked EVERYWHERE!  yuk.  saw feline pine at target and decided to try it out- SOO Much better!  Despite reviews i do NOT have a special litter box, just the $20 lid one sold at petco and it works out fine with this litter.
5;Holds a perfect amount of K-cups!;I'm so thrilled I purchased this K-cup holder!  It holds a perfect number of cups for the choosing. Many of my friends have other holders, but I like this one the best.
5;Alba Moisturizer;After trying lots of other high end products on my skin but with no results I decided to give a try to Alba Botnica.I have started using this product for last few days I found that this product is actually good.
5;fantastic!;fresh and good for you.  swift shipment.
1;Tastes & smells like chemicals!!;Horrible! I thought the coffee machine was broken or dirty. So I tried another, horrible, cleaned the machine, and same results.
4;Makes a pretty good peach soda;Seems like a great idea, and I will try some more flavors.<br /><br />The container is convenient to carry around<br />You can flavor any volume of water<br />Easily adjust the concentration of flavor to your liking<br />Hassle free mixing, no floating powder, quickly disperses in water instead if dissolving with mixing<br />No little packets to dispose of<br /><br />However.
4;Lots of beans!!;I received my vanilla beans promptly a few days after ordering.  I chose to purchase 1 pound of the grade B beans for making vanilla extract.
4;No scoop!;This is the second Pacific Health brand I have used, the first being the orange flavored Accelerade.  I tried this one because it has less sugar.
1;Nanas Coconut Chip Cookies;I was disappointed when I opened my first cookie that was ordered from Amazon.  Although I am still eating them, they were stale.
5;Great quality.;We've been using Stevia for 8 years, now, and buying this brand for one. It's very convenient to order online, rather than look for it in stores.
5;Cinnamon hot chocolate;This hot chocolate has been a favorite of my family's for at least 5 years. It has a smooth chocolate taste with a hint of cinnamon.
5;scrumptious!;My family loves these cookies.  Yes, they are a bit more expensive than popular brands, but they have all natural ingredients and are delicious.
5;Best Meal Drink Powder Mix I Have Tried;"I have tried several meal replacement products, and make note that Amazing Grass has this Amazing Meal and also a SuperFood drink powder that looks similar and the same flavors, so I am not sure what the difference actually is, but the word ""Meal"" in the title meant to me that it was more likely what I was looking for than just a supplement powder. Anyway, the whole family got on a health kick after Mom got cancer and we tried to find the healthiest yet easiest to stick with supplements."
4;Love it but want the other flavor- chocolate chili - yum;This is some good stuff - watch the sugar content. But I wish I could get the chocolate chili flavor.
4;crunchy goodness;For a store bought cookie, these are good.  Very crunchy and a good flavor.
5;Confused by other review;I received the product today. None of the bears were broken, but there were one or two of them that had some of the peel wearing off(only marginally though).
5;Best energy drink period.;No Fear used to be my coffee, but tastier and without the ex-lax effect. Out of all the much worse energy drinks out there (Rock Star and it's billion different flavors, Red Bull you can feel the kidney stones going down your throat practically, Full Throttle's dry and dehydrating drinks and Monster just doesn't count as an energy drink) No Fear was taken off the shelves.
1;Research this product online before purchasing!;"Warning to dog owners! This product has caused many dogs, including mine, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures. Please Google: ""Dog Food Review - Purina Busy Bone Dental Treat"" and click on the first link in the results to view the mounting comments and complaints."
5;Japan's healthier alternative to caffeinated energy drinks;This is a healthier alternative to those high-calorie, carbonated cans of caffeine that pass for energy drinks. I first tried Ukon Energy in Japan, where I spent roughly seven years living and working in both Yokohama and Tokyo.
1;Henry's Blend? Where?;Seattle's Best has obviously been taken over by idiots. That's the only explanation for this new change in product look and taste.
5;greatest coffee;I've recently purchased Tully's French Roast K-Cups from Amazon. Well this is the best coffee no bitter after taste, wonderful smell of coffee brewing, very  easy to make.
1;If you like eating the wrapper, buy these.;I purchased several containers of these SweeTarts and they were all stale and unpleasant to eat.  And that's only if you could get one out of the wrapper that didn't have white plastic stuck all over it.
5;Great in Coffee, Oatmeal and Shakes!!;I am trying this coconut oil as a dietary supplement. By itself, 1 Tbsp tastes very rich and coco-nutty.
1;Not Up To Nature's Path Usual Quality;Stick with steel cut oats and your own spices. I typically love Nature's Path, but this oatmeal is gross.
5;HUGE!;Wow.  Now that is a HUGE bag of popcorn!  I bought this for my mother at the same time as a Whirly-pop.
4;Canidae - Still the best;I've been feeding my two labradors this food for about 3 yrs now and they are both doing well.<br />My older lab (13yrs.
5;Excellent cat food !;I got my cat at a shelter and they feed this to the cats there. My cat Wanda loves it.
1;Contains GMOs! We say NO!;Kellogg's Pop Tarts are a good source of GMOs! They hit a home run here with 4 out of the 5 biggest GMOs in these products. Kellogg's just spent $632,500 on propaganda in California because they don't want you to know that Pop Tarts (and their other products) contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides.
5;Well worth the wait!!!;I Googled best dark chocolate and Leonidas was among the results. Their wonderful, personal touch customer service (rectified a delivery problem immediately) and the BEST dark chocolate I've tasted (as a dedicated, life long chocolate snob) make Leonidas Belgian chocolates a keeper.
1;nojoke;"""This was a rip-off, paid twice as much for the item than what I normally pay. Emailed and did not receive response, called and spoke with a rude, sarcastic person who answered the phone with ""hello"" I had to ask if I was talking with someone from Liquid Nation."
5;Awwesome!!;I absolutely love these salt and vinegar almonds!!!<br />Being a fan of salt and vinegar potato chips when I saw these I knew I had to try them. Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.
4;THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --;FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock.
5;Love this stuff!;I was a coffee drinker before I tried this tea.  It is fabulous.
5;Nussini in US;I used to buy as many Nussinis as I could fit into my suitcase every time I went to Austria, and would have people visiting us here bring it as well. This may be the second best chocolate in the world (Pischinger Mandeltorte being the best).
5;molly likes it;arrived really fast very happy with it. and molly really likes it.
5;Amazing taste!;I purchased these chips because I love sweet potato chips in general, but these far surpass the taste of your ordinary sweet potato chip. These are crisp and crunchy and not as sweet as the standard variety.
4;Good Choice for a Tassimo Tea Disc;I've tried several brands of Tassimo Tea Discs and in my opinion prefer the Twinings Earl Grey Tea.<br />I don't drink coffee so I strickly rely on Tea (and Tassimo Discs) for my warm liquid refreshment and whatever health benefits tea afforts.
5;Earl Grey;Love, love this tea. I was looking for loose leaf Earl Grey after having some with a friend.
4;Tried Many, Some Great, Some Not;"We have a <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Dr Oz recommended!;Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically).
5;A new grain-free choice for your cats;My cats have been eating Innova EVO, another grain-free food, for a while.  I've noticed a great improvement in their general health but I was never really happy about the fact that their binder is potato.
5;I Loved the Cinnamon Snaps!!!!;I picked the Cinnamon Snaps up at my Grandma's local health food store the last time I visited and loved them.  I have yet to try the ginger snaps but I'm sure they are just as good.
5;Really tasty stuff.;"So far this has to be my favorite of all of the ""Energy Cola""s I've tried. More carmelly than Red Bull Cola and less spicy than Howling Monkey."
5;refreshing;Celestial Seasonings Peppermint tea is really nice over ice.  For a non-caffinated beverage that is also healthy, it's a win-win.
1;Over Priced! Check local drugstores;The product is YUMMY! and tasted even better since I got them from my local CVS store during Christmas time for $10 - so glad I bought more than one!  It seems to be strictly a seasonally stocked item, so normally I wouldn't mind paying a little more to be able to buy and enjoy them year round but a near 300% mark up..
5;Best M&M EVER!!;"These M&Ms remind me of tiny little Almond Joy's surrounded by a bright candy shell.  They are spectacular!! I hope this company does itself and every candy lover in the world a favor by making these ""special limited edition"" candies a regular in their product line."
5;What a lovely new minion...;Finally, light.  At least I was well protected and shipped in a hurry, but I hate that box.
5;Perfect size;
1;Very dissapointed.;I truly was looking forward to using these flavored syrups for making Latte's and other coffee drinks. First of all I do not like Splenda sweetener because to me it has a lingering after-taste.
5;The Perfect Little Pinch;While searching for a gift to encourage a friend who was trying to give up using tobacco chew, I came across this cooler full of Buffalo Bills Beef Jerky Chew (shredded beef jerky). My friend was thrilled with his clever gift.
5;gunpowder green tea;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Vanilla extraordinaire;this vanilla tastes far superior to anything I've ever bought in my megamart. It really makes a difference in everything I've baked with it.
5;Perfectly YUMMY Unique Blend of Spices;I love trying new spices and rubs and when I found this I just had to buy this!  The unique taste of the barbecue of New Orleans is all about the special mix of spices and flavors. With the New Orleans Style rub I have been able to turn ordinary barbecues into a special dish.
5;Anthon Berg Liquor Filled Chocolate Bottles;I have bought these for the last several years at Costco. This last time I bought 4 boxes of 64.
5;Great Chips with less calories;These chips are delicious and good for you.  I buy the small bags and they are just right to eat with your lunch or for a snack.
5;My dog loves these;My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs, but my yellow lab loves them (she's about 4 years old).
5;Unbelievably Tasty!;I absolutely love this gnocci.  I find the texture and flavor to be better than regular gnocci.
4;Great coffee;Great coffee.  The swiss water method is the way to go and is much easier on your body.
5;My favorite flavored coffee;I prefer flavored coffees and this one and the pumpkin spice are my absolute favorites. The chocolate and raspberry go so well with the coffee that it's like drinking dessert.
3;But locally if possible - doesn't ship well;I bought these licorice wheels online after I failed to find them in local stores. I intended to use them to make the legs of brownie-bite spiders for a Halloween party.
5;Tastes like Sprite;The packaging could be better, i find it a bit messy.  The bottle cap is the measuring device, kind of like a laundry detergent cap.
5;My dog loves this;I use these drops for training and my dog just loves them.  The price is reasonable and the product is easy to use.
3;so small!;This juice is my favorite (so delicious) but the juice boxes are smaller than I remember. My little kindergarten sister who is very petite needed at least 2 of these boxes in her lunch.
5;Very Tasty Vegetarian Chicken;I love these and the fact that they are low-fat is a definite bonus
5;Oh-hhh... Yummy!;"My kids know I have a sweet-tooth and that my favorite flavors are caramel and vanilla, so what better gift than <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3;Tasty but not strong enough;I like my tea strong.  I normally drink PG Tips but saw this cardamom tea that reminded me of some flavorful teas I have had in the past.
5;Dogswell Vitality Treats;I purchased these for my pug puppy to help with his training.  He loves them.
5;Great Tasting Lentils;If you love the taste of lentils, then you'll probably love these lentils, which are more similar to the French Puy lentils than what you'd find in the supermarket.  The great thing about these lentils is that they don't take hours to cook, and you pretty much can't over cook them into a gooey paste, even served as a leftover a day later these tough little lentils hold up their shape.
5;Good;I think the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee is pretty comparable to the iced coffee you buy from Starbucks. It's not as good but you can't expect it to be as good as the brew you get from Starbucks so I'm giving it a five stars.
5;The only coarse salt for me!;I found this salt one day in an Italian deli in Half Moon Bay, CA.  I got really hooked on the coarse variety.
5;great tea, great price, great service;"Being British in America and finding a good ""cuppa"" is almost impossible. but I think with the stash breakfast tea I can happily live here forever."
5;Coconut oil;Wow! am I impressed!<br />Never knew about coconut oil properties besides issuing it for cooking.<br />I use on my long hair as a mask then all over my body and wow! my husband is also hooked, he uses on his feet and hands 3-4x a week he can actually see the difference as well.
2;Like syrup-way to sweet. Buy Coco Lopez;I purchased this thinking it was a better deal than the Coco Lopez, which was excellent with just a little bit added to my strawberry protein shakes.  As another customer mentioned this is just like syrup.
3;Received the oack of 2 and realized the expiration date was within 3 months of receipt.;Received the pack of 2 and realized the expiration date was within 3 months of receipt. Plus the blue was pink.
4;Good;Good coffe at a very good value. Tried others but will stick with this one.
5;YUBAN-DARK ROAST COFFEE;I can only say that this is great coffee, never tried before until recently..
5;Really deserve more stars!;O-M-G..
5;Delicious;I am brand new into brewing loose leaf tea and this was the first cup I tried.  Delicious!!  I will never be going back to tea bags again.
2;They were melted and the chocolate had turned white;We love these bars but i won't order them shipped from anywhere anymore.  They came melted, white, and didn't taste as good as they do when they are fresh.
4;Good product;This is a great sugar alternative in small doses and its good for you as well. It can help with your teeth.
5;Yum;I recently discovered LARABAR and am in full addiction mode.  I love most of the flavors.
5;Tastes great!!;I LOVE THIS COFFEE. I am not a huge coffee drinker but I really love these flavors.
2;It is fine for the under 9 crowd;This is junk candy. My kids love them but overall it is just another sugar product.
3;Nothing to write home about;Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.
5;Healthy substitute for Rawhide.;We had decided not to give our dog rawhide, but he is an aggressive chewer and needed something to chew on.  I ordered the SmartBones hoping for a substitute for the Dingo Bones we had given our previous dog.
1;WAY TOO EXPENSIVE !!!!;My little rat terrier will only eat Little Cesar--- For the last 5 years I have bought these small cups of food.<br />I pay at my local grocer .
5;Instead of mayo, use Banana Yoplait yogurt instead.;This is a delicious, easy pasta salad to make and it only takes 21 minutes to make until you put it on the table.  Just follow the easy directions on the back.
5;My cats love it, it saves their life and is worth every penny!;Giving your pets meds, no matter what form, can be an awful experience for you and your pet. Two of my cats were diagnosed with thyroid issues which means they need pills, twice a day, forever.
4;Add your own meat;Barilla is making several different microwave meatless pasta dishes. The sauce and the pasta come out very tasty when following the directions on the box.
5;Great for Mead!;My favorite mead yeast..
2;not whay expected;The boxes I received where NOT the same boxes shown in the advertisement.The do not fit the shelf space I have.
5;Pricey but my cats love it;Petite cuisine is probably the best cat food I have ever bought for my cats.  Open the can and it looks and smells like people food.
4;YUMMIE!!;I ORDER THIS SYRUP 3WKS AGO WITH MY ICE SHAVER I BOUGHT OFF OF AMAZON AND MY 2GIRLS REALLY LOVED THE TASTE AND I DID TRY IT MYSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL BAD. SOME WHAT SMALL BOTTLE IF USING IT 3 OR 4 TIMES A WK WHICH WE DO BUT WE JUST ORDER DOUBLE BOTTLES ONCE WE GET HALF WAY DWN.
5;Baronet Coffee;Baronet coffee pads are a great tasting coffee, that we can use for our coffee (pod) maker.  Excellent tasting.
5;MY DOG LOVES THEM AND NEVER TIRES OF THEM;ALL I DO IS SHAKE THIS CONTAINER AND MY DOG COMES RUNNING. SHE HAS HAD FOR OVER A YEAR AND PREFERS TO ALL TREATS AND FOOD.
5;Perfect Everytime;This is by far, one of my favorite Melitta coffees of the Cafe` collection. It brews perfect every time.
4;Good taste. Too pricey and a little bitter;Good tasting and a little addictive. I bought it when Starbucks was giving free shipping and now they're tacking on $3 for s/h.
4;Great  Popovers;The Stonewall Kitchen Traditional Popover Mix makes yummy popovers.  What is great is that you just mix a few ingrediants, put it in the oven and voila, you get the taste of great homemade popovers.
5;very pleased- great taste!;We usually buy the Newman's bold K-cups, thought we would try this for something to switch up occasionally, and since this is less expensive, it caught our eye..
5;Great Supplement;THis is so good for you and It tastes good too.<br />If you put it with orange juice you can't even tell the difference.
5;sweet potato chips;These sweet potato chips are surprisingly good.  A healthy chip with low sodium and good flavor.
4;Great Tasting product!;My cat really likes this one. Likes the extra gravy ones the best.
3;Melted and could not give as a gift..;I have a friend who loves these. I could not give it as a gift, because they had melted and the outside plastic was really stuck to the carmal.
5;Great Satisfying Coffee;This is one of my favorite. It smells so good while brewing and leaves you satisfied with no after-taste.
5;Creamy Smooth Dark Chocolate;This is an excellent creamy smooth dark chocolate with more depth then expected for a 54% cocoa bar. This is between the best milk chocolate and the best dark chocolate.
5;Better than the conventional brand!;I am a huge fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but I've been trying to get away from conventional cereals and all the junk they contain. This is a great alternative.
5;The absolute best coffee I've had for Keurig;"This is probably the best coffee made for the Keurig single serve brewer. Bold statement, I know, but this is one bold coffee that stands apart from the mediocre ""Green Mountain"" blends that Keurig offers."
4;Decent chip for GF folks;This chip is one of our family favorites to dig into chili, guac, or other hearty (meaning thicker) foods.<br />Unfortunately Amazon has taken it off the subscribe-n-save, so off to the local grocery store during sales.
5;Great product;Great beans used to make extract, vanilla sugar, and kept a few to make cakes and frosting with.  It has only been a couple of weeks and the extract already smells like the store bought stuff.
5;best product I have ever bought;I have researched many products that contain acai berry in them. This product- that is all it is, 100%.
5;Very pleasant taste and nice foam on top of every cup;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;ok;Having been a professional cook for over 20 years I try to seek the best ingredients.  I was very pleased with this product.
5;Yum!;So, I get the variety pack from Costco.  It comes with strawberry, pears, and apple.
5;Finally a treat both you and your dog can enjoy!;First off, i would have to say that I did not find the Bacon flavor to be appealing at all.<br /><br />OK I'm kidding.
4;My cat loves seafood pate;Who can account for a cat's taste?  My cat love seafood pate, and hates any of the various filets in other cat foods.  She also hates beef, chicken she will tolerate.
5;Great snack food, took a chance and I am very happy I did.;What a find!  these crackers, I mean crispbreads, are great.  My boys love them as they have just enough fruit and nuts to add a more spalsh of flavor but not so much to overwhelm the taste buds.
1;Beware Chicken jerky products made in China;I returned this item after reading multiple warnings from credible sites about dog products made in China causing serious illness and death.  I didn't feel it was worth chancing it for my dogs.
5;Great tasting;The taste is really good - I do love coconut, but this has just enough balance where the coconut does not overpower. It helps with my heartburn as well.
1;Would be perfect BUT;Puppy LOVES this food BUT the manufacturer has so far failed to take the steps necessary to eliminate BAD BAD Ethoxyquin used to preserve the fish meal ingredients from its suppliers. It is NOT necessary to use ethoxyquin to preserve fish meal
5;Excellent product;I have had many relishes in the past but this  one  is superb. I use it in so many areas of cooking.
5;Delicious!;These oatmeal cookies have a great spice taste -- pronounced yet not at all harsh.  Light and crisp, and they also keep well.
5;yay. that feels better.;I'm actually drinking this as I type. So this is my PMS-y review.
5;Delicious!;I am not sure how I am going to write 20 words about this - it is good coffee and I enjoy drinking it. I even drank it during the spring, which is not the usual time to be drinking this autumn-like beverage.
5;Wonderful!  Life Saver.;My english bulldog had severe food allergies.  It would make him lick his paws until they were red, paw at his face, itch, and worst of all have very frequent messy poops!<br />I tried many remedies and foods until I tried Natural Balance.
4;I couldn't get it right;This was the first flavor I attempted making lollipops with and I couldn't get it right. I burned the sugar, or I would add too much or too little oil.
5;No High Fructose Corn Syrup!;Not only does this soda taste great, but it is sweetened NATURALLY.  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is in practically everything these days, and it is one of the worse things we can consume.
4;Softer, smoother skin;After recently having a professional facial, I have been interested in finding an OTC enzyme mask for use at home that isn't as expensive as the $60/jar product the facial was selling.<br /><br />The scent of this product is quite lovely.
3;Thin and lacking flavor;I got the Keurig as a present recently and have been trying all the samples that came with the unit. I like a smooth tasting coffee with lots of flavor, especially for breakfast.
1;diseased plant;Plant showed up about a week after ordering and was covered in a white fungus or mold..
4;Drinking it right now.;Very good flavor and would have given it five stars except it is a little on the mild side and I had to use an extra scoop per pot to make it right. Maybe I should try the dark roast.
5;my dogs love'm;my dogs love the taste of these and they do help somewhat with keeping their teeth clean. This vendor has the best price.
2;Neither tasty nor healthy;I tried one of these cookies without looking at the nutrition label and I think the taste was at the one star level.  It tasted highly processed and while soft, was dry.
3;Way overpriced!!!!;Great product but this vendor is selling it about 30% more than you can get it at a Target or Babies Rus. Convenience isn't worth that much.
3;WOW!;I was about to make another purchase on this milk. I was going to do the monthly shipment.
4;Mmmmmmmmm;Not as good as Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, but these are available at least. They are VERY good.
4;Fine Basic Orange Tea;****<br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.
5;Arrived as described;I ordered these K-Cups with points from my credit card.  They arrived as described, but without much packaging - - they were just sitting loose in the box, which works for me.
5;Camper van Beethoven is the greatest rock band ever;Well, maybe not &quot
5;Five Stars, Every Time;I like sardines, particularly sardines smoked and packed in olive oil. Sardines are available without being smoked, in a ketchup sauce, in mustard, and packed in a non-descript vegetable oil.
5;Hairball treats;My cats love these Whiskers Temptation treats and Amazon is the only place I can find them.  As I have five cats it is much more convenient than the  hairball gel.
5;Family's Favorite Kcup;We absolutely love this K-cup. I prefer to make a frappe using it but the rest of my family likes just having a straight cup of the carmel vanilla cream.
5;"If Amazon sends you FRESH, this coconut will not be ""hard!""";$2.70 per pound on Subscribe & Save is the best price around for unsweetened shredded coconut, and this is PREMIUM coconut, too! If you get it and its HARD - COMPLAIN - because what you were sent was STALE! This coconut is another fine product from Bob's Red Mill! We freeze ours, vacuum sealing all but the bag we're currently using, and we never have to endure stale, tasteless coconut, even a year or more later.
3;golden valley turkey jerky;"I have always been very pleased with this product and have purchased it monthly for a very long time.  However, the product I received last month should have been called ""turkey BURGER jerky""."
5;Wow!;Zevia orange really tastes like orange soda - and not like orange DIET soda either. How did they do it? I'm impressed.
1;spam;The most expensive spam in the world. I knew that I should haved passed when it wasn't sold and shipped by Amazon.
4;Tastes like more than 100 calories;I wasn't expecting much from a cappuccino in a can but this is quite good.<br /><br />-Smells like coffee.
4;Passed muster in our house!;We ordered these to see what they tasted like as compared to other GF bars that we keep on hand at home. Most of the typically on-hand bars are loaded with calories (over 200), so for us the junior size was ideal.
5;Best wet food I've ever purchased!;I have 2 super-picky older cats (13 & 9).  I've tried so many options, but this is the first one where the CLEAN the bowl.
5;Gluten Free!;As of 6/1/09, General Mills has made many varieties Gluten Free: Corn Chex, Rice Chex, Honey Nut Chex, Chocolate Chex, Strawberry Chex and Cinnamon Chex.  [.
5;Cinnamon Hot Chocolate;"I ordered the new Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD for the holidays.  There was a recommendation to order the ""No Sugar Added Cinnamon Hot Chocolate"" to drink while listening to the music."
5;Yum! This is my kind of cereal....;Nutty, crunchy, and tasty, Quaker Brown Sugar Oatmeal Squares is what I'm talking about. It holds up well in milk, even taking one's time to finish the bowl, and the taste leaves you wanting more.
5;Great product at a great price!;These bones are great! With my two goldens we have to be careful of what kind of bones we give them to chew. They get sick from rawhide and a lot of other bones, but these they did not get sick and they actually removed a lot of tartar from their teeth.
5;Maple Syrup;This is a wonderful tasting syrup.  Is great on pancakes as well as ham.
5;LOVE this tea!!!;This is not only one of the best tasting green teas out there, I absolutely swear by it for when you're getting a cold or have one. It works miracles.
5;Sadly, these were awesome.;Why sadly?  Because now I will want to buy and eat these every day and they are not kind to my diet.<br /><br />A gluten-free cookie with a delicate ginger bite that is half-covered in chocolate?  I'm just not sure you can get any better than this!  I didn't have high hopes because I've tried gluten-free treats before, and they generally leave something to be desired.
5;Repel Review;Repel wipes work well to repel mosquitos. The wipes go directly on your skin.
5;The only one for me;This is the only type of coconut oil I've ever bought, and I see no reason to change brands because this one is so great.  I make chocolate bark with it, stir fries, and baked goods.
4;Cost too much;Folgers Silk is my K Cup choice I love it, ,but,The price has increased too muchI ,will not buy anymore.<br />Bed and Bath is cheaper per cup IF you use their 20% off coupon.
5;Dogs LOVE Himalayan Dog Chews!;Yes, Himalayan Dog Chews aren't cheap.  Yes, some dogs won't like them.
5;Excellent Dog Treat;"Right now, ""Mini Naturals"" are the only treat that I give to my dog.  I prefer them for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Ingredients:  When you buy any food or treat for your dog, it is always important to look at the ingredients and the first ingredient especially."
5;Monthly Buyer;"I buy about 5 lbs a month of the 12"" Bull Sticks.  They arrive almost immediately."
5;great product!;I take it every day. I used to take fish oil but when I made the change to plant based oil for my body, it was like night and day.
4;Certainly not bad;This is definitely good maple syrup. It's not the best I've ever had, but I'll certainly buy it again.
5;Lightning;1. Effective as a 5-hour energy<br />2.
5;Great product quick delivery;This is a great product and would highly recommend to all Keurig fans. You can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost.
4;Worth checking out;I was skeptical when I first heard of this product but decided to give it a try.  Amazingly, it works!! While it isn't the best chocolate cake I have ever had, for gluten free it is pretty darn good, at least good enough to satisfy a chocolate craving.
5;Exactly as expected.;Good clean peanuts. Ground them up into peanut butter and they were great.
5;So that's why it costs so much!;I was really hesitant to buy this food because it costs about twice the most expensive premium brand grocery dog food costs at the pet food store, but decided to give it a shot since Amazon offers a deal for subscribing. I honestly wouldn't even know about this product if our new puppy's  breeder hadn't recommended it, and was using it on their pups.
5;great tasting superfood snack;I'm gluten free and on the go. Grabbing this on my way in or out is a quick and easy way to ease hunger or cravings.
1;Bad;If you like bones including the spine mixed in with your fish then you will like this product. I sure wish they would show you whats inside the can, because the label sure made it look better than the suprises I found when I opened it.
5;Best Dog Food Ever;After bouts with Pancreatitis in both of my schnauzers (neither are overweight, but have major sensitivities to fat content), this is the only food I can feed them without worrying if it's right for them.  It has no corn, which is fantastic--unlike other cheaper brands.
1;Gas station coffee dispenser garbage;"This stuff tastes like the ""coffee"" you get from those vending machines at interstate gas stations or 7-11s.  The first ingredient listed on the box is group of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils."
5;Muesli from Bob's Red Mill;"Excellent way to start your day, cereals, nuts and dried fruits that make this ""oatmeal"" one of the best I have ever had.  You can also sprinkle it over yogurt to have a chewy treat."
5;Bought as a gift & it was a big hit!;I have a friend that loves Mars bars. I bought as a gift without including a card.
4;fun for all ages;Mom and I used to make this some 40 years ago, then we couldn't find it anymore.  Now with computers I was able to locate some as my mom had mentioned it a couple of years ago.
5;Tasty and Crunchy;I tried two varieties, the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters and the Cinnamon Oat Clusters, both with Flax Seeds.<br /><br />The package, which weighs 11 oz.
3;Not my favorite;Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.
5;Great gift idea;I bought this for my nephew for christmas and though I haven't given it to him yet I know he's going to love it
5;Heaqlthy Alternative;Great product.  I mix it with some green tea extract.
4;great product;i wanted this as a gift but the can came dented and scratched! the package it arrived in was like new. the product was sold to me as new and came busted.
4;An Enjoyable Treat and Delightfully Crunchy Breakfast Cereal. Enjoy!;Quaker Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares are absolutely delicious as a snack right out of the box or as a breakfast cereal with milk.<br /><br />They are sweet, but not too sweet.
5;So delicious it will make you smile and count your blessings!;This is the MOST wonderful damson preserve I have tasted since my grandmother made it at home (east coast USA) in the early 1970's.  Treat yourself to this gorgeous, deep ruby preserve and let the delight soak through you!  Put it on toast or a warm biscuit with butter, and be transported to taste bud heaven and good, simple times past all at once.
5;Buy from them;Product came as advertised, undamaged and nothing unexpected. I was thoroughly impressed.
3;Eh, they're all right;These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.
5;Love it;My doggies loves it.  Didn't take her too long to figure out.
4;was not like in the picture.but if microwaved after thaw tastes great;the picture looks delisious..
5;Wonderful FlatBread!;This is a must for any gluten-free household. The bread is great.
5;Fast Shipping, Wonderful Gum;I wasn't sure about ordering this, but I couldn't find it in stores. Under a week later it showed up and I love it.
3;Not worth the price.;I did not realize that this was the price for ONE bottle.  That's my fault.
5;Great Tea Flavor;Had this tea at our local tea/coffee shop.  Luckily, I was able to purchase it there (last one).
2;Poor Packaging;I purchased packs of 12 o four different flavors of these breadsticks. I was very disappointed when I received them.
3;Fun;Our puppies both destroyed the edible one in record time, ignored the hard white one and played with the gummy one. I would have rather had three of the gummy ones.
5;Highly recommended;The package arrived on schedule and in good condition, with plentiful quantities of each fresh herb. No complaints, would definitely buy again.
5;Overall Very Happy;It seems like they have tried to improve the selection of coffees since the reviews that I read. These are the coffees that I received and the quantity of each flavor.
5;Very good product.;a very good value for money product.<br />It is nice, does not smell.
5;Good Bold taste !!;This is one of the best if you are looking for a bold tasting cup of brew from your kuering. I will be a repeat buyer.
5;Rave Review!;"What's there not to like??  I am not a ""chip"" person usually, but was looking for something yummy that would do justice to my homemade hummus.  These fit the bill!  Nutty, crunchy, full of flavor, fiber-rich."
5;One Dog's Opinion...;This will have to be short, but sweet as I have a tail to chase..
5;Packs a punch!;I came to the amazon site to find these because I hate going to Walmart and that's the only place I've been able to find them. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are much cheaper at the brick and mortar stores than here.
4;Good strong tea - nice over ice;I bought this specifically for making iced tea and have not been disappointed.<br /><br />The only thing I find with the Ahmad varieties I've tried is that the black tea is strong and you have to be careful not to let it steep too long.
5;BEST COFFEE EVER (ALMOST);I was always a Columbian coffee drinker until I tried this.  A friend had given me a Keurig coffee maker, so I tried many samples.
3;Really sweet but sort of tasty;At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried.
4;Not Postum, but a good alternative!;I ordered Cafix because a search for my old standby Postum was not being made anymore.  It is a grain hot beverage, non cafeinated, good with milk and sugar and even the kids can drink it.
5;Greatest food ever!;My dogs have food allergies and I tried a holistic brand and they would not eat it. I tried the Newman's Own dry food and they loved it so I decided to add a little of the wet food.
1;Not good;We were BIG fans of Sprout- had a great experience with a lot of the flavors-until this flavor.  My daughter actually got sick.
4;Good for Spiderman themed goodie bags;These worked well for our Spiderman themed goodie bags (pink/light blue ~ red/dark blue). And guess what--they are not tiny lollipops: 1.
5;Searched everywhere for this!;I happened to buy a small bottle of this a few years ago and was frustrated that I was never able to find it again, until now.  This seasoning is amazing on fish, chicken, shrimp and vegetables.
5;Pass the caramel...tea.;I love caramel and this tea blend did not disappoint! It is very rich, creamy and has so much real caramel flavoring that you will wonder how you ever lived without this matcha blend. I will caution you about one thing: store it in a double lidded tin, this one is fragrant in a good way.
2;Gelatinous and an Odd Sweet Flavor;I understand that opinions vary greatly in these things, but I cannot for the life of me see how so many people like the Sweet Baby Ray's sauces.  I tried the original recipe and this.
5;Based on beef being grass fed however . . .;the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone.
5;the best hot sauce ever;We tried this in Mexico (the lime one too). I was so happy to find it on Amazon.
5;Great for portion control!!!;Very helpfull in controlling portions..
3;pen review;"These pens did not write on frosting well even after it was ""hardened"". The did write on white chocolate."
5;Clean Teeth & Not Fat;My two cats really like this cat food.  My vet does too.
4;Great Tasting and Refreshing;My family and I are all tea lovers - both hot and cold.  The Lipton to-Go is of course an iced green tea.
5;Sleepy Tyme Tea;I have sleep apnea, and after years of trying the 'alien' CPAP machine and sleep studies, I have found that three bags of Sleepy Tyme Tea, and two Breathe Strips positioned on my nose, allows me to sleep through the night.  This tea is GREAT.
5;Great for tear stains;Not only is this a high quality food, it is USA made.The distribution is at Ohio pet foods, which is an EU certified plant.
2;not so good!;"I have a 6yr old beagle who doesn't have much teeth and like to gum things to death.  I bought this product thinking the name ""Everlasting"" Treat Ball would be great for my almost toothless sweet heart."
3;Okay but not great;This coffee is okay but certainly not as good as Green Mountain's Breakfast Blend. It just doesn't taste as good.
2;Was too good to be true;I had high hopes for this new, indie California olive oil, and purchased it based on the rave reviews and the reasonable price.  Sadly, you get what you pay for.
5;AMAZING TASTE!!;I have to say this is the most amazing taste I have ever had.  I searched everywhere for this.
5;Love it!;Not only is this a convenient, less messy way for me to incorporate peanut butter in my diet..
5;Quite Good Tasting.;I'm trying to increase the seafood part of my diet and my local grocery has a small display of canned seafood items. I'm trying them out.
5;Great Un-Soda;This is a great soda that's not really soda. If you want natural kiwi and berry flavors, buy this item.
4;Not Very Gluten Free.;This is good basic TVP.  If you have celiac, the canary-in-the-coal-mine-type that reacts to 18 ppm gluten, this is not for you.
5;Awesome!;I think the email below from Mom tells you all you need to know about this product.  She also said that the package was heavy and that the Amazon gift wrapping was perfect.
1;Doesn't work very well.;I am on my fourth  application and the vine still isn't totally gone.  Not very effective.
3;Dark Roast Production Problems;Having used the Senseo Dark Roast pods for years, I was happy when Amazon got them back in stock.  But the coffee is now undrinkable--it is incredibly bitter
5;No Reason to Kill Innocent Animals for Jerky!;Primal Strips are delicious as well as cruelty free.  No sentient life was taken to produce them, and they're ultra low in fat and calories as well as high in protein.
5;So So Sweet;I'm currently stationed to Iraq & it's nice to receive purchases so quickly like I received this one.  All packs were fresh and well sealed.
5;They Really Mean Improved!;Wellness has taken an already great product and improved it even further. I initially tried introducing Wellness to my black lab in 2003 and found her to be intollerant of the Lamb formula.
5;Great organic on the go snack;My daughter, who is in preschool, loves these Happy Baby organic pouches-her tops flavor are the apple-cherry, pear, mango, banana kiwi.  They are perfect chilled and very nutrient dense.
5;Absolutely the best tahini I have ever tasted.;Now understand I have only tried 7 different tahini manufacturers but this is smooth, no bitterness and helps me make the best hummus ever.  I recommend this highly.
5;Wow It Really Works!;What a surprise when I got home from the grocery store and opened this package to find cups that really look nothing like the ones you are used to.  I was a little worried when I saw that instead of all plastic, this actually is made out of very little plastic and the coffee is actually held in material just like regular coffee filters.
5;Dogs love it!!!;We have been using Castor & Pollux for around 6 months now and our dogs love it. Make sure to mix their old food with the new food half and half when you switch them over to help their stomachs adjust.
4;Nice Idea, good flavor, a little bitter;This product gets a 4 star vs 5 star due to one little factor, bitterness. For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste.
5;I am in love!  EXCITE ME!  YUMMMMM;Wow, what a fantastic rice.  No need to go back to anything else.
5;What I needed;The tea has a mild, pleasant flavor and is easy to combine with others, without overpowering the mix. I've just moved to a new town, and I don't know where to look for the teas I need.
5;At last I found Kraft Hot Barbecue Sause;I am so glad to be able to ordrer the Kraft Hot Barbecue sauce off line, as it is no longer avaialble in my local area.  I have used this sauce for about 20 years and was very disappointed that it is no longer being sold in stores near me.
5;Dual use;The unit is well made and works well.  It comes without Cofffe, order the assortment pack of coffee if you want that.
4;New fun treat;My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while.
5;Green mountain coffee extra bold ,breakfast blend;I don!t have a Keurig coffee myself but i buy Green mountain blends for my daughter in-law and a niece. We all are very satisfied with it.
3;Way too dark for my taste;I typically enjoy Ghiradelli dark chocolate, so when I found a deal on this, I jumped on it. My favorite variety is their 60% cacao Espresso Escape.
1;Not light!!!!;When I first ordered this product a couple years ago, it was a light honey color (as shown in their picture.  The last two batches I received were an amber color and they added an unpleasant flavor to the margaritas I use this for.
1;Great items, but the expiration dates on all four jars was in 20 days.;I ordered four bottles of Dynasty Duck Sauce, they arrived safely on the 14th of September, and the expiration date on all four bottles is 10/04/2012, that is in twenty days. That is not okay with me, I live alone and there is no way I can use all four jars by 10/04/2012.
1;Works for a Minute... Gives you pain for hours;I never drink energy drinks. I'm in college and all of my friends drink them like they are water.
5;Great coffee;Finally, a decaf in a pod with some flavor.  I'm certainly going to buy this again.
5;No Filler Nuts;This is one of my favorite nut mixes: cashews, pecans and almonds.  There are no peanuts, no brazil nuts, etc.
5;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5;LOVE these chips!;I have been a long time seeker of junk food substitutes to help maintain my weight. I will never again, and I repeat, NEVER, buy another baked chip again.
5;Great Coffee;Great, smooth instant coffee. It's low in acid which is good for my acid reflux.
5;Very YUMMY!;Really like the way these taste.  Can taste the fruit.
1;They make nice rattles for a 2 year old;This is the worse coffee I have ever had. I admit I drank it many times because I had nothing else to drink and I wanted caffeine.
5;Enjoyable with milk or dry.;A nice crunchy taste to start off your morning. It is also very good dry as a quick snack grabbing a handful and eating as i blog.
5;Wonderful aroma, delicious taste;This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat.
4;Flavorful shredded nori!;This is a very flavorful seasoned nori. It is shredded and not in sheets.
5;Most wholesome, authentic raisin bran;This is by far the best raisin bran available.  By available, I should say barely available.
1;Poor Design, hate it.;"I was disappointed to find that this is the only option in orville redenbacher popcorn.  This ""bowl"" is impossible to open without making a big mess."
5;Amazing and addictive;Can't get enough of these.  I think they just converted my vegetarian daughter!  Think I'll have to hide them from her.
5;Perfect! Tasty.  Cleaner mouth in 3 min.;This gum is perfect for me. I don't want to chew and chew.
4;Not a Starbucks Chai alternative....;This is a cane sugar flavored syrup which has a decent Chai flavor though quite different from the Tazo Starbucks variety.  As a syrup it is inherently sweet and, of course, dilution makes it less sweet but also reduces the nice spiciness of Chai.
5;Great dog food;My dogs love this stuff.  You feed less food thus picking up less poop.
3;When good Customer Service tasted better than chocolate...;Let's cut to the chase. The chocolates I ordered as a gift to my daughter arrived melted.
5;Very pleased;The oil is very nice - quite neutral-tasting. I like that it's sold in several smaller bottles rather than one large one, so that it stays fresher.
1;worst experience with delivered flowers ever;I have never had a worse experience with delivered flowers.<br /><br />It started out when placing the order.
5;Soft Taco Bake;The product is not yet available in stores in my area and I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  I used one of the packages to fix supper and the entire household liked it as much as I do.
3;Okay......if you're a dog;"I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of ""Lickety Stik"" over when I went to pick up my dog."
5;Castor & Pollux dog cookies;These are great cookies. My dog, Kacey loves them.
5;Chewy deliciousness;I am a huge fan of the Quaker Chewy cookies! The moist cookies are satisfying and not too sweet. The high quality ingredients are a crowd pleaser.
5;Natural Balance Canned Cat Food;It's excellent for your cat.  The veterinarians recommend this product highly.
3;Dog likes it;These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry.
4;Good stuff;So, trying to reduce sugar in my diet.  I love this brown rice syrup for use as a topping (meaning, using it as an actual syrup, or honey).
5;Depends on the Dog;I have several dogs and got one of these in medium to see how it went over with my pups. Most of my dogs nibbled on it for awhile and moved on, but one of my beagles LOVED it and carries it around with him, keeping it away from the other dogs and chews on it for long periods.
1;Landslide on my head.;"Ok so I was very excited to try this product out. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner from Clear and am obsessed with them so naturally I thought I would love the ""nourishing scalp & hair oil"" too."
1;Do not buy Vita Coco;Buyers beware:  Vita Coco claims to be 100% pure coconut water.  It is not.
5;Best way to keep my toddler eating his veggies!;My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.
5;Chip A'Hoy;The chips were fresh and shipped safely all the way to Afghanistan and quickly. I would definately order these chips again when I finish the others.
5;GREAT Cookie;Probably the best packaged cookie we've tasted.  Better than the vanilla Oreo.
4;vanilla decaf;I liked the coffee but wish it had a little more vanilla flavor to it. I have found all decaf flavored k-cups seem not to have as much flavor as the none decaf.
4;Hmm Hmm Pretty Good;I love cereal.  And I especially love the honey flake cereals.
5;Nice supplement for on dry kibble;Feed dogs bones and raw food diet but also give kibble. A sprinkling of this on top of the kibble is popular with our dogs.
5;Diminished my bruise!;I bought this for mainly external skin treatments.  I mix this with a little bit of turmuric for acne cleansing and toning mask and it works extremely well.
5;THE BEST Baked Chips;These are absolutely the best tasting baked chips out there.  You can't even tell they are baked except that they're not greasy.
4;Great for toddlers;My 17 month old daughter tried these at a b-day party and loved them so much she ended up having 2 before we cut her off. Her twin brother found them frustrating to eat as he does not have molars yet.
2;a bit disappointed...;I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years..
5;Very good coffee;This is a wonderful coffee for the k-cups. At 34 cents a cup the price is great too.
5;picky son loves these;I see that some people just hate these.  My son, who is the pickiest kid on the planet LOVES these things.
5;Custard!;So glad to see that we can still get this custard.  For some reason our grocery store doesn't carry it anymore.
5;natural calm;It's a great product.I have used it before and,would recommend it.
5;Just as described on the tin - super sour;Not much to say, except that this is just as advertised - yummy and super, super sour. If you like sour things, do not bother getting this.
4;Whole Wheat Fig Newtons;These are really tasty - a little different from the old tried and true version.  I was a little overwhelmed with the number of packages we received - we'll have fig newtons until Valentines Day
5;Nostalgia in a box.;This item was purchased as a gift for my sister. As children of the 80's, we enjoyed our fair share of odd candies and surprisingly a majority of them were in this box.
4;Not awful at all;My coworker who has a Scottish fiancee was reading a Reddit thread where people were posting their favorite national products of their home country -- the Scots overwhelmingly chose Irn-Bru. My coworker said that he had tried it while visiting Scotland and it was the most vile soda on Earth, with a taste out of hell, a sickening combination of burning hatred and battery acid.
5;Delicious!!;This soup tastes just like what I get at my favorite sushi place! I cannot believe a soup this tasty came out of a packet.  Even if you add a little more water than the 2/3 cup it requires, it still has a very full flavor.
5;BEST COCONUT WATER EVER!!!! I've Tried Them All;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2;Not impressed;This salt is very very 'salty' with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />There are better products (search for South African East Coast sea salt).
3;If you enjoy cherries..;..
5;Healthy Canned Diet;Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive.
5;i use this for everything;This product is wonderful. Slowly but surely this is being spread to all of my relatives and loved ones.
2;Pros and cons...;Pros: Very low-calorie
5;Slowdown Time;This delicately flavored herbal tea has become a favorite of mine. It's soothing, relaxing, warming and leads me to a restful night.
4;I'm a bit of a caffeine addict.;I've had over 1,000 energy drink varieties, and i'm always looking for a good bargain. 30 days of energy for about $6? Sign me up!<br /><br />Well, it's sorta more like 15.
4;Very good organic canned peaches.;Probably the next best thing to fresh organic peaches are these canned ones.  They're not overly sweet but have a nice natural fruit sweetness.
5;tully,s french roast k-cup coffee;Love this coffee it is full bodied and just the right flavor. I drink alot of coffee and this one is a keeper.
2;To hard to bite;I have had organic dried fruit before and could actually chew it. Not this though.
1;taste is disappointing;Not even close to reeses peanut butter cups flavor. Blah, bland & forgettable.
1;Dry and boring;"There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.<br /><br />While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the ""freshest and most mouth-watering desserts"" it is the complete opposite."
5;great product;Sweet Home Farm Blueberry and Flax Granola..
5;Healthy Chips at a super price;If you are addicted to potato chips, or just love snacks, you may want to grab some of these.  I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.
5;blueberry muffin taste, in a thin cookie wafer;Remember when Fig Newtons were boring? there was only one flavor, one shape, and they were the kind of snack my grandmother kept around that the grandkids all hated.<br /><br />These are NOT your grandmother's Newtons.
5;great baking aid;This is an excellent product and I use it just like I used to utilize the regular Bisquick product.It works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening.
5;Slowly approached, but definitely enjoyed;"My pups (aged 6 & 5) both enjoyed these, but since they talk I couldn't get their ""official"" position on them.  That said, having trained them extensively I'm pretty good at watching their body language."
5;Nutia Coconut Oil;We have used it for popping our popcorn and it taste great.  This is the first coconut oil we have used and we do like it better than other oils.
4;Clear - Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy Shampoo, Total Nourishing Care;Note: This review was made by Ron's girlfriend as she used the product.<br /><br />This shampoo has a great scent and silky texture!  I am able to use a smaller amount than my regular brand to create a nice lather that rinses easily (and I have hard water, so that is a challenge with some other shampoo brands).
5;No Reason to Kill Innocent Animals for Jerky!;Primal Strips are delicious as well as cruelty free.  No sentient life was taken to produce them, and they're ultra low in fat and calories as well as high in protein.
4;It's popcorn;This is popcorn, plain and simple.  Not the best tasting or freshest in the world, but it tastes better than the bulk kernels I get at whole foods and the price isn't bad.
5;From milk to kefir cheese, this powder does it all;Bottom Line:<br />This milk can feed kefir, make cheese, or simply be a great, convenient solution for milk.  Makes 3 and 1/3 gallons so try to purchase when around $10 to make ~$3 a gallon.
5;Delicious;Not much to say about this this candy. If you like gummy rings, and the flavor cherry, it taste awesome.
5;I'm addicted to them!;BEWARE! These are highly addictive! I became obsessed with them on a trip to Scotland. The chocolate is wonderful- not that waxy coating you'd find on US malted milk balls.
5;Excellent;Sent the chestnuts to my 89 yr. old mother.
4;Knorr Vegetable Soup Base;I love to make stew and soups of all kinds and I use a tablespoon or two of this soup base to add vegetable flavor that I love.  I highly recommend this item.
5;Love these little Sugar Daddys!!;I have been ordering both these and the larger ones.  They are so good!  The reason why I order both is because the smaller ones are good to take along with you while your driving, on the go etc
5;Some of the Best Butter I've EVER Had!;I don't often review food items (usually books, movies and the like). But this almond butter by Onceagean is just THAT good.
5;Dog loves it;I trust this product and trust the company.  My dog does extremely well on both canned and dry.
5;A Place for my beans :);This is a perfect addition to my desk. It doesn't take up a ton of space, but holds pletny of Jelly Belly beans.
3;great food, but the seller is mishandling the merchandise;Our dog loves this food, but this seller keeps shipping me damaged goods. In each shipment we get at least one or two severely dented cans.
5;What my dogs have to say . . .;"Anytime I shout out ""Mr. Greenie! Four dogs come running, ages 12 to 2."
5;ZiwiPeak Real Meat Dog Food;This product is so very convenient when traveling to dog shows.  High quality and the dogs love it.
4;Great Coffee, Not so great change in price!;For those who love bold coffee, Jet Fuel, is for you.  Other brands that offer bold roasts are just not as good.
5;Benjamin loves these....;He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL.
5;Who said these were flops???;Ya pop one in your mouth & enjoy..
3;Wrong size;I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.
4;Healthy portions of flavor despite healthiness;"This is a tasty cereal with all kinds of vitamins and minerals. The grains and seeds make for a healthy breakfast (even by modern <a href=""http://www."
5;Best Pill Pusher;Our dog now requires twice a day pills and the Greenies Pill Pockets are the easiest and most convient way to accomplish these tasks.  No more scrap of cheese or lunch meat.
4;Lovely smell, tastes pretty good overall, REAL sugar;I love peppermint and chocolate as a rule. I was a little wary of this canned coffee mix at first.
2;Not what I Expected;I had hoped for a better cup of coffee but this did not deliver. Douwe Egbert is great coffee but i think i needed to get a better quality or something as this just did not do it for me.
3;Good green tea with hints of lemongrass;My true love is coffee, but that doesn't automatically mean I hate tea.  I drink quite a bit (even more as I've gotten older), especially mint and green teas.
5;Excellent!;These are excellent lentils, from a great agricultural area. I've been to the Palouse several times, a wonderful, amazingly beautiful region of rolling green farmland in eastern Washington/northern Idaho, famous for photography, rich soil, and, well, lentils.
2;Wonderful aroma...terrible taste...yuck;I have trouble finding plain white tea in my area, so I tried this Lipton, Mango & Peach flavor.  The name sounds good, the aroma was enticingly delicious & made me look forward to my first sip.
4;Indispensable;Our Zozo has loved her mango pouches from before she could ask for them by name.  Nowadays, she goes through the small Happy Baby mango pouch in seconds so we introduced the Banana, Mango and Peach to add to her breakfast/snack repertoire.
5;My favorite appliance;I love ordering my coffee for both of my favorite coffee machines from Amazon.  We live 20 miles from the nearest town and getting packages through the mail or UPS is great!  I've been drinking Senseo for about 5 years now and wouldn't change.
5;Finally good sleep;I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night.
5;These are good pastries;I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.
5;WOOHOO!  These are so great for baby AND me!;I actually usually use the Plum Organics baby food brand, b/c those have veggies in them.  But these ones are great too.
1;Didn't work at all for us;We have brown tiny ants all over our kitchen.  This didn't have any effect or make a dent in the population.
4;Great healthful juice!;This product wasn't available for awhile, but now seems to be back in stock. Don't order it from another health store featured on Amazon, you'll never get it! Order it directly from Amazon.
5;Great herbal tea;I grew up on lipton black tea, brewed for hours, no sugar, no lemon..
5;Numi Green Tea;I followed the package brewing instruction, and it is the best green tea I had so far - not bitter and no after taste. It is easy on the stomach too.
5;Best tasting high protein bar;I believe I've tried just about every bar in existence. I found this bar at my local REI and while expensive I figured I'd give it a try.
5;If you want a sugarless gum that really tastes great;This really does taste a lot (not exactly) like regular bubble gum.  It's thick, chunky, and kid's can make huge pink bubbles with it, and it lasts and lasts.
2;Way too tart for my taste;I didn't care for this drink at all.  It's almost like eating a sweettart in liquid, carbonated form.
3;Weak sauce;I didn't taste hardly any clam in this sauce at all.  It was not offensive, just blah
3;This Is Caramel Corn;This tastes more like caramel corn than kettle corn. I'm not totally upset because I do like the taste of it.
5;Delicious!;Before requesting these, I read a few reviews because the last time I requested a snack via Amazon Prime, said item supposedly had a laxative effect. Like many other people, I originally thought that these Fruit Thins (despite the name) would have a fruit filling within.
5;Great flavor!;These are full of nuts.  Great flavor.
5;fantastic flavor!;Ive yet to try other cappuccino flavors, but this one is awesome..
5;The best coffee;My husband and I were so disappointed when they discontinued Starbucks coffee discs., after reading the reviews on amazon and trying several different coffees, finally found this one, it's the best coffee so far and my husband is very pleased ! I didn't think its possible to find anything to replace the Starbucks coffee but this is it.
5;Very good tasting candy;I have these, along with the cherry and lemon versions, in a candy dish on my desk at work.  I've had to buy a pound of each type twice now in the last 2 months because they go fast, everyone seems to like them very much (I do too!!).
4;One of my favorite marinades;This is one of my favorite marinades.  Though most of the time I make my own marinades, this is the one I like to buy ready-made.
5;Great tasting curry powder to compliment your red meat;I've been googling curry powders for a few days. I had a craving for lamb curry masala just like how the local restaurant makes it.
5;Awesome Customer Service;My son struggled with constipation while transitioning to Baby's Only from breastfeeding when he was nine months old.  I contacted BO by email about my son's issue, and a representative got back to me immediately.
3;S O O O O.....Y U M M Y.............B U T.....;I HAVE NEVER MET A POTATO CHIP I DIDN'T LIKE.  I HAVE NEVER MET A<br />POTATO CHIP I haven't eaten.
5;It tastes like water;I was afraid to try this after all the negative comments. I saw it at a local grocery store and decided to buy one.
4;Pretty good;Everything was good except for a few dented cans. I dont know if the cans were packaged dented or got dented via the shipping process.
5;Good tea, lots of it, keeps undead at bay;I love earl grey tea, and this is a good one.  I drink this every day, and I have not been bitten by any vampires or werewolves.
5;A great tea that may prevent cancer;The bag of tea arrived quickly and was well packaged. This is the second order of this tea that I have place with Amazon.
5;Very good vanilla, and in a powder too!;The problem with most vanillas is that you can taste the alcohol that is used to leach out the flavor.  Not with this.
5;Amazing! Calorie Protein Ratio = Perfect!;I am always looking to keep my calorie/protein/fat ratios within check to get the most nutritional bang for the buck. This is by far one of the top 5 finds for my smoothie arsenal.
2;WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!  AND BEEF JERKY IS VERY OLD.;We buy a lot of Beef Jerky and usually Jack Links.  But, I have to say that Amazon charges a LOT more than grocery stores.
5;Delicious!;Doesn't unclog sinuses, but it tastes VERY good! I love original Sleepy Time and this sleepy time tea as well. Soothing, cool and minty to the tongue, palate and throat but still has the familiar taste of Sleepy Time.
5;Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum!;Coconut cream has got to be one of my favorite foods. It is wonderful for cooking, making candies, desserts, or eating just plain.
5;best chips ever;I first had these while on vacation in Florida.  Heard you could buy them at cosco.
5;Delicious iced;I'm a daily iced tea maker and drinker. Bounced around between lots of different teas but settled on plain black tea as my favorite.
4;Tastes great but it's BARELY peanut buttery :-(;"This tasted more like a corn puffs cereal than a peanut butter puffs cereal.  Well, there's a strong ""hint"" of peanut butter, but they definitely could've increased the taste."
5;Great tasting coffee!;I love Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee for Keurig K-cups. It really has the taste of butter toffee and is not bitter.
5;Hickory smoked salt;This salt is an absolute must-have for beef ribs. I grew up eating my parents' recipe, and I can't eat beef ribs without it now.
5;A Healthy Treat;My Shih Tzu, who is such a finicky eater, would eat these instead of a meal if I let her.  I gave it five stars from her as I have never tasted them and have no intention of doing so (although if you read the ingredients they are fit for human consumption).
3;Cheaper else where;I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.
5;Mom's favorite;My mother really likes Hazelnut coffee and likes her Senseo brewer.  This is one of the few products that works in her coffee maker.
5;Love the coffee but the prices are too high;I have been buying this coffee for quite sometime and love it.  I also like Newman's Own as an alternative, but the prices online are too high.
5;buster cube;Great toy but a mouse got stuck in it,  was half hanging out and dead.<br />so much for that.
1;WARNING OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST!!!;Buyers Beware, 1 lb. of Marzipan for $4.
3;Like macaroons--chewy, VERY sweet, kinda expensive, but nice with coffee or tea for a non-full-of-processed stuff treat...;Just got my order today for one bag each of the Tropical (these) for me (I like coconut) and the original (which I thought my hubby would prefer).<br /><br />The cookie: It's kinda small.
5;Excellent Madagascar Vanilla Beans;Fantastic PLUMP and MOIST Madagascar Vanilla Beans - Excellent price. I can get one  tiny, dry one at the grocery store for 9-10.
5;Great snack;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Delicious;These are very good bite size candies.  They just seem to melt in your mouth.
4;Good Taste;I really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then I would like. The Gustaf's rounds are a little better.
5;Great Ingredients and my cats like it;I'm working on getting my cats coat and weight on the proper track.  I haven't noticed any immediate changes but it's been only a week.
5;still the best - light;Claxton makes this light version as well as the dark version which I also like. This was fortuitous, as I was able to gift two of the loaves to friends that expressed interest in the product.
5;Wouldn't Go Without It;I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.
5;this is my crack;it's hard to say how much i love this stuff. i've tried many brands, but this is it for me.
1;Not as good as the others;I tried this hoping that it would be another good GF staple in my pantry. I didn't like it as well as the other brand I buy.
1;hated them;I was expecting something that would taste good and have a good texture.  Wrong on both accounts.
5;Huge difference;Like other reviewers, I have a cat who would get sick often. I had her checked for issues, but she is otherwise healthy.
1;Horrible;I was expecting these to be gum, my mistake. But I still like candy.
5;Good stuff.;Good when done as directed, but better if things such as meat, peppers, onion, etc., are added.
5;i love everything form this company!;this company makes the absolute best sea vegetables. and the prices when you buy in bulk can't be beat! just about half the price than in the local health food store.
4;I like it;Lower sodium tomato sauce has all the benefits of a spaghetti sauce without the issue of high sodium content. I've used 6 bottles and I'm pleased (I do add a bit of hot sauce but I do to everything).
5;great!;My dog loves this food, and it lives up to all the others comments and high ratings.  Our vet gave us a list of foods that are highly recommended based on nutritional value and this was one of them.
2;Tasted good the first few bags...;But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it.
4;A Great Grocery Product From Canada;YUP-these are made in Canada. The company web site says they're based in Preston, Washington in the foothills of the Cascade mountains.
1;Close call!;I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.
4;Good quality licorice, but the Pomegranate flavor is not for me!;I was excited to try these and when they arrived in the mail I opened the package, closed my eyes and got a whiff of an almost medicinal smell.  The weather is quite hot now, and the package was warm when I opened it so that might have contributed to the smell.
5;rich, warm, wonderful;This is the best tasting coffee out there. Don't bother with other flavors, varieties, etc.
5;Keurig K-Cup Coffee Sampler;These flavored coffee k-cups were exactly as expected and were received on time. The flavor assoetment allowed us new k-cup users the ability to try various flavors.
5;Gold Standard;I believe Tinkyada is the gold standard for gluten free noodles.  I love their products and find that most people will not notice a significant difference using them in recipes.
5;Yumbay Taters;Very Yummy Potatoes (and chick peas)..
5;cat food;Good cat food. My 20 yr old cat licks up the gravy and I get to throw the rest away.
5;Calories are the divine punishment for tastiness!;"And Heaven knows that Caramello bars are absolutely divine!<br /><br />When you open a Caramello bar for the first time, you might think, ""what's the big deal?""  It smells and looks like a normal-ish Hershey bar, which is as good as all Hershey bars, but why are these people so obsessed?  If it's a warm day, the bar will have cracked open, and you will already know -  but for the sake of this review, it's a normal day, the bar is in one piece, and you haven't discovered the incredible surprise that makes a Caramello the sinful and delicious treat that it is.<br /><br />Break the bar open and pull the two pieces apart."
1;Not what I thought;I'm very disappointed in these.  There's<br />WAY too much cinnamon and very little<br />vanilla taste.
4;Great treat!;These treats are one of my dog's favorites! I like this company, they make a lot of great treats, and the ingredients are from the U.S.
5;Amazing Roses! Perfect Gift!;I bought these roses for my mom who went to vacation with my sister's.  I got it for her Mother's Day present and she loved them.
5;Looking for the old school Trident Bubble Gum;I live in Panama City Beach, Fl and was wondering if anyone knew where I can score some of the old school Trident Bubble Gum. I've chewed this kind for about 10 yrs so I'm a huge fan.
5;Best price for the best salt!;Got this in fine and course ground. Best price out there! This is the ONLY salt any of us should use.
2;Pretty weak flavor;I don't know what makes Organic coffee different from regular coffee, and in this instance, I honestly don't care.  I'm used to Starbucks coffee, as well as the occasional Pete's coffee, as well had coffee in France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands.
5;Excellent, no junk, dogs love, great price;I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.
4;Senna Leaf tea;A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular.
5;"""WOW""";I have over the years ordered many brands of Biscotti from Amazon.com as it is my source for many items I can't find near my home.
3;malty if brewed as directed...;"I am a big tea drinker, with only the occasional coffee, but this product was just too malty for me. By ""malty"", I would also describe the flavor as having a ""fermented"" flavor to it which could not be made ""tasty"" by the addition of milk and sugar."
5;5 Stars... not enough for this!;Please try this Smoked Beef Steak for yourself. We have been enjoying it for a couple of years now and I am just so pleased it is now available through Amazon so others may learn about it's TENDERNESS and the WONDERFUL FLAVOR.
5;DELICIOUS and ADDICTIVE;Everyone who tries them ends up eating the entire bag.  We ordered two cases of 12 in bbq and garlic parm and they were gone in two weeks.
5;Delicious!;I am increasing my monthly order for this product.  We tried it iced and it is delicious, but also love it hot.
5;Bold coffee;I buy extra bold coffee and brew it on the mug size in my Cuisinart Single Serve Brewing System, it makes the perfect cup of coffee. This coffee has a rich flavor, just perfect.
5;My picky spoiled dog loves these;My dog is even getting picky on her treats she is so spoiled.  She will no longer eat pupperoni or any treats along that line.
1;Good if you want to break your teeth!!!!;Candy arrived so stale you could not broken it with a hammer.<br />Seems like it was sitting around somewere for a couple of years,<br />candy went straight into the trash.
5;Great Stuff - My Kitty Loves it!;My cats love this stuff!  This size 1 1/3 is perfect for a small house-hold of cats (one to three).<br /><br />They just go over to the container and start playing with it - to let me know they want to have some cat nip.
5;Best. Candy. Ever.;It's true.  This has got to be the best candy ever.
1;NOT DIGESTABLE AND CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS;SADLY, I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THESE MOO BULLY STICKS ARE NOT 100% DIGESTIBLE! MY DOG ALMOST DIED AFTER A PIECE DID NOT DISSOLVE IN HER STOMACH.My 3 dogs loved these Moo Bully sticks.
5;Really great tasting soda and with no HF corn syrup;Jones makes some great sodas. I had stopped drinking soda for several years, but trying a Jones grape soda got me drinking it again (only theirs).
5;PB2 with Chocolate (Powdered Peanunt butter);all i can say is ymmmmmmmmmmmmm  Meeeeeeeeee.  Excellent tasting product with few calories, unlike regular peanut butter.
5;Excellent Assortment of German Cheeses;This combination is fabulous, from the smoky Bruder Basil to the creamy blue there is something for everyone. While I was not crazy about the Emmentaler or the ButterKase there were guests at my little soiree that couldn't get enough of it.
5;One Wonderful Cup;This coffee rivals the name brand coffee house and right in my own kitchen. I am the only coffee drinker in my home so I make one or two cups each morning and the no-muss-no-fuss delivery of this system is unbeatable.
2;Way too weak and watery!;I don't like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery, it's like drinking..
4;Very good hot sauce...!;We are a couple from the northwest side of Mexico and we do know about peppers, in fact i don't know any person who tolerate hot peppers like my lovely wife. She can eat fresh habanero without a blink or a sweat.
3;Looks healthy but cat won't eat it;The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it.
2;Would not buy again;I love Lu products..
3;Medicinal;I tried this as a hot drink, and I have to say that I found it completely unpalatable (three sips into the drink I had to pour it out, as I could not take any more). I can conceive of only using this as a medicinal drink for upset stomach, nausea or vomiting.
1;Not A Good Choice;Only one star because the chips had a rancid, old taste and smell. The chips were in date but the oil in the chips oxidized.
5;a favorite, a big favorite;This is the only canned food that our oldest cat, now at least 17, will eat.  She has eaten it for years and now<br />the next oldest is eating it too.
1;Each of my FOUR dogs got sick the day after eating these!;Since buying these last week, EACH of my four shihtzu's got sick. They threw up undigested pieces and became listless for the rest of the week.
5;let's be serious;eating my first bag as i type.  awesome.
5;My Vet's Recommendation;1 of my 2 dogs was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Part of the treatment is a change to a diet with a different, non meat, non poultry protein source.
5;Couldn't be more pleased!;One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.
3;hot!;I absolutely love Panang.  This doesn't taste like any panang I have ever had.
2;Cheap but not very good;I was surprised to find wasabi peanuts for such a low price, but after receiving them I now know why.  These will certainly clear your sinuses, but quality is poor.
4;sent as a gift!;I sent this as a gift to a family member and they seemed very happy with it so there ..
5;LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF;This is the best sugar free tasting syrup on the market. I use it to also sweeten hot coffee, cocoa, and tea.
5;really great product, dogs doing well on;I looked at.several diets for skin sensitive dogs.
5;Works well;I really like dream water.  The lemon flavor is really good, and I get drowsy in about 45 minutes after I drink it.
5;super fast shipping, free samples;placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping
5;Havana Night Theme Party Giveaways!;I'm so excited to have found these! I am having a party for with a Cuban theme and these are perfect! I work in a retirement community and we will serve a special menu in the Dining Room that night. Afterwards, the servers will take real cigar boxes to eachtable and offer the residents an after-dinner cigar.
5;Salt for the Grill;I use this salt as an ingredient for meat rubs when I cook on the grill.  The salt melts quickly into the meat.
5;Even For Larger Dogs;We have a boxer/husky mix and he seems to like these treats. Much better for him than the previous treats he was getting before.
5;We really like it;We've been drinking this tea for 3 years now.  My whole family really enjoys it.
5;Jelly Belly Fan for 30 years;They might be funny looking and I may not get to pick my flavors, but for a person like me who can eat a ton of Jelly Bellys this is the way to buy them.  I usually wait for a sale and quite often they will have them Buy 3 Get 2 Free.
5;Perfect cups. I won't have to buy again for a long time.;First, I should note that when I'm writing this review, the price is almost $50. I paid about $30 when I bought these a few months ago.
5;Excellent value product;I was a bit suspect at buying this tea due to the very low price. But, the truth is that it's high quality tea at a bargain generic price.
5;The BEST GF mix made!;My son and I have been eating gluten free for many years and I have tried every GF mix that becomes available. Pamela's Ultimate baking and Pancake Mix is truly the best! The rest of the family cannot tell the items I make are wheat free and gluten free, a tell tale sign that this mix is really good.
3;Weak, least favorite Republic of Tea tea;I found this tea to be very weak flavored
1;Food poisoning;Sure it was cheap, but every time we used it, my wife and I got sick within 2 hours. Symptoms were as if we had been drugged or taken a heavy dose of sleeping pills.
5;YUM!!;I cannot stop eating these wonderful chips!  Even my children like them.  I am currently a WW member and each bag is only 3 points so I get to eat the whole bag without any guilt.
5;Fantastic taste on the grill or as a condiment;I picked this up from a local grocery store and am hooked. It's just spicy enough to leave a tingle on your lips, and the mix of spices is superb.
5;Made in the USA;My dogs, a Yellow Lab and a Border Collie LOVE these. I love them because I know they are healthy treats and it is so hard to find treats made in the USA.
4;Decaf Coffee;The is the best decaf coffee ever for breakfast and with dessert in the evenings.  The blend is perfect, smooth, with no bitter aftertaste.
5;K-Cups Coffee;This was a great price for this bulk box of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee, a delicious & aromatic flavor suitable for drinking every day.  It's flavorful, but not overpowering.
1;Stale;I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this.
1;It's gets worst every order;The fist time that I bought a batch I was pleased because as a result of a review (I think) they were more careful with the selection.  The later purchase was not very good but still was not bad enough to make me give them a bad review and I decided to give them another try.
5;USA & Size Matters;My dog doesn't like big bones. She barely chews them and then they lie around all yucky! These knee bones are a perfect size.
5;Great flavored coffee;Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
5;fight that cold!;I either got lucky twice or this stuff staves off an oncoming cold. My three grandkids are with me all the time and are all under three years old.
5;Decaf?  You Wouldn't know!;Bamm!  This decaf is a winner.  You could serve it to anyone who swears they can tell the difference between regular and decaf, and they would not guess.
5;Deliciously strawberry!;Out of the gold foil package, the matcha smells like juicy strawberry, like smelling strawberry fruit leather or a strawberry flavored candy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional cup of hot matcha, 1/4tsp of sifted strawberry matcha whisked in some 175f filtered hot water,  the green tea comes out as deliciously earthy with no bitterness.
5;These are very hearty and tasty chips!;I found these in Salt & Pepper flavor in huge 20 oz. bags for $2.
5;Best instant tea I've ever tried!;This is hands down the best instant tea I've ever tried.  I am partial to mango teas but completely dislike instant tea.
1;UGH.  Read CAREFULLY before PURCHASING!;I thought I would be purchasing 5 packages of 1.5oz EACH.
1;just awful;Love the other flavors..
5;One of the best sweet hot sauces out there;It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces.
3;Little too Sweet but Not Bad;"Considering this is a microwave instant type of food I wasn't expecting much from it. There is a good flavor overall, but the spices and noodles are overshadowed by way too much sugar - peanut sauce should be slightly sweet, but toward the end of the package it seemed like all you had left on the taste buds was ""SWEET""."
2;found a fly in the bottle of apple juice;fast delivery, well packed because it's all glass bottles. I rated them 5 out o 5.
5;Wonderful for dry hair!;Great conditioner for dry hair!<br /><br />I've used Ojan & other hair treatment oils. This is one of the best! Gives my hair a nice shine, without feeling heavy or overly oily!<br /><br />I used after a wash & regular conditioner that wasn't doing anything much for my hair.
5;Chef I am not!;Since the lovely topic of food introduction has been brought up recently I decided to do my own research and came across this Beaba Babycook, boy am I happy that I did! I couldn't be happier with it. I am no Julia Child or Paula Deen, nor do I claim to be but with this little machine I do feel like my own version of a Top Chef.
5;Best Price: Be aware these are probably not the same as you get in your local store;Just be aware these are not regular kind you most likely find in your local store that uses sea salt and olive oil.<br /><br />They are raw.
5;Stephens Hot Hazelnut Hot Chocolate;This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.
5;Have your Tea and get your sleep;If you like Iced Tea but not the Caffeine this is the product for you.  It was a while before I knew this product was out but I switched right away.
4;Pricey but the dogs love it;My two dogs love Wellness brand dog food.  It's expensive but I just feel I'm doing the right thing for them with food I think is probably good really meaty food.
5;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.;I've suffered from scalp issues since I was in my early 20's.<br />I've tried just about every potion (shampoo) known to man.
4;Good Product;
4;Love the pulp but not the Amazon packaging;Love the taste and the bits of pulp.  First shipment was in a small box, no cans dented.
5;trader joes seaweed snack;i have been reading about super high doses of iodine in seaweed..
5;Good Stuff;You'll love this syrup even if you don't like sugar free stuff.  It doesn't taste like it's sugar free and that's what makes it really good.
5;Best Irish Soda Bread;I used to buy the mix at a local grocery store but they stopped carrying it. Now I can order from Amazon.
5;Wonderful!!!!! ( I purchased them from Amazon.com) Love Amazon;These chips taste great! You will not go wrong with them they are low in calories high in fiber. If you eat to much like more than one bag in a sitting, you may become constipated! other than that they are wonderful you will not be sorry.
4;Good coffee at a good price;I like this coffee. It makes a great 8 oz.
5;VitaCoco is the only coconut water!;I have tried several brands of coconut water and this is my favorite by far!  It doesn't have the added sugar or pulp like some of the cheaper brands in the can.  It's all natural and smooth tasting.
5;Our new massage oil;My wife and I give each other massages, it cuts down on the expense of going to a massage therapist and allows us some quality time.  We have tried a combination of cremes, oils and lubes on our quest to find one that:<br /><br />-is nice and slick<br />-doesn't dry out<br />-has a pleasant aroma and taste<br />-doesn't irritate the skin (i must have sensitive skin b/c several of the commercial ones gave me slight rashes)<br />-can wind up internally (sometimes one thing leads to another
5;Amazons Organic Oat Bran a winner;Great taste, mix with yogurt and eggwhites then fry for 5 min a side. Wonderfully tasty.
1;Gross!;I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.
4;YUMMY:);We ordered a case of these without never having tried them before and were pleasantly surprised..
5;Loved them.;Really enjoyed my bag. Tasty and will order again due to the price being cheaper than local stores.
4;Ginger Lover's Desert;Ginger Snaps are delicious.  Not too sweet and loaded with flavor.
2;Hidden Ingredients;Palm oil and coconut oil, 2 of the least healthy oils, are used in the date sugar. I wish this was made clear in the description.
5;Wow, yum!;True to the name, Food Should Taste This Good, these tasty little chips really deliver. So fresh, no taste of stale cooking oil! Just the right amount of salt and crispy crunch and the touch of olive makes for a very sophisticated little chip.
5;Delicious!;After tasting a bag, I decided to send a variety case to a friend for her birthday.  The whole family was delighted and couldn't stop raving about how delicious the healthy snacks were.
5;DELICIOUS ...I ate them out of the jar...sigh;I got this on Woot, Amazon's sister site. They were a lot less for three different varieties.
5;Hubby's favorite lunch;Thank you Amazon for being a great site for almost all our needs. My husband loves these noodles as they are so simple to make.
5;Excellent;These in-shell pistachios are absolutely yummy. Most shelled ones taste like dried raisins but these have been preserved fresh and firm in their shells.
5;This is an affordable Luxury;Living in Nebraska, we can purchase real maple syrup in the store, but I really like supporting family farms directly.  This way, I'm pretty sure that the products I purchase are top quality.
5;How could you go wrong with Starbucks?;Seriously, how could you go wrong with Starbucks? The Pick Place Roast is great, but I prefer the Breakfast Blend. I think the Pike Place Roast is best in a travel mug.
5;Great Syrup;This syrup is wonderful if you like peppermint.  It is one of the best I've had.
3;I LOVE Mestemacher bread but...;..
5;Beautiful Yellow Roses....;Beautiful ..
2;Too bitter and smoky;My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.
2;If you like coffee.. buy something else;Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on.
5;All time favorite spice;I use this on everything!  It combines my two favorites, garlic and pepper, perfectly.  And it's organic! I highly recommend this spice to anyone who loves garlic and pepper.
2;Not so good.;If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others.
4;Tasty;Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.
5;A new favorite!;I had this tea for the first time at Monument Valley in the Navajo Nation.  The night I had it at The View restaurant, I enjoyed it along with a sampler platter of traditional Navajo foods.
5;My cat won't eat anything else;We all know how finicky cats can be--one day they eat with relish and the next turn their noses up at whatever earlier enthralled them. My aged cat and I have been down this route before many times--starting and then abruptly stopping different cat foods.
5;Delish.;This product is delicious!  I got a bottle once at a little boutique store and sort of lost it in my fridge.  Well I found it again just recently after I had grilled pork chops.
4;Good;They are good for what they are. Like others have said, they're filling.
1;Worst solid alacore tuna ever;This is bad tuna, can't say it any better.  It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make.
2;Not What Expected....;I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium.
5;Best Coffee Ever ~ Why Spend Big Bucks;Senseo coffee pods make the best cup of coffee I have ever had.  No more starbucks, you loose your shoes and purse there so expensive.
5;Delicious crepes;I love any French crepes or cookies, the texture is very light, buttery tasting and the sweetness are just perfect. To eat just one is never enough.
5;feel the burn!;In place of working out, I simply have a three of these at a time, and trust me, you feel the burn.  A perfect amount of sharpness and cinnamon flavor.
4;Sugar cane;So glad to finally find sugar cane online. The price is probably great for a home buyer, but for my restaurant I wish it were a little lower.
5;Baby Brezza makes it a breeze;I am not the main chef in our household. My husband enjoys cooking whereas my comfort zone is being the clean-up crew(washing dishes, storing leftovers away).
3;it's red bull!;Everyone knows how good red bull is. I was subscribed to this for a long time until I found Power Horse.
5;My favorite flavor...;I've had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me. It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands.
1;Mouth burning;The popcorn pops great but after eating a few mouth fulls, my mouth started burning.  It far too salty.
3;Try Before You Buy in Bulk;My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.
5;soothing;Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is.
4;Pleasantly surprised by a unique tea!;I bought this tea (as well as the apple cider variety) as favor gifts for an autumn tea party bridal shower. I wasn't sure if I would like it myself as I can never seem to get home brewed chai tea to taste like coffee/tea house chai.
5;...lingering of sheer hotness! :);"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix<br /><br />If you like your tea Strong and Spicy (with a nice little bite to it), like  <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Ms. B;My Hairy Kids, dogs :), love it. I have rescued dogs and cats all my life.
4;Good well balanced flavor;"The pumpkin flavor is suttle and not too sweet.  I rarely like flavored coffee but this one is well balanced and still tastes like ""coffee""."
5;Marmite;I've seen some people compare this to soya sauce, I would say it's savoury sort of like soya sauce but I can't say it tastes anything like soya sauce. Delicious and nutritious when spread thinly on toast.
5;The Real Deal;This stuff is great on everything from eggs to burgers to BBQ anything. It has wonderful smokey flavor, and as the label says it's fairly hot(for true chile heads It's pretty mild).
4;Make sure the big bags are cheaper than the smaller boxes!;The cereal is great--obviously I think so since I buy these huge quantities of it from Amazon. Just a tip: do not assume that you are saving money by buying the big bags of it.
5;My Dogs Love them!;I have 2 small dogs and Dogswell treats are the only type they will eat.  They love the chicken and sweet potato and the small round chicken disks.
4;Soda you can feel good about drinking;It's hard to go wrong with Izze. It's just like soda, except it's made with actual fruit juice.
5;Itsy Bitsy dog biscuits;My dogs love these! I have small dogs so it can be hard to find small treats that don't add a lot of calories to their diet. I like the fact that they have quality ingredients, & are baked.
5;Highest Rating.;"This product when received became an instant household staple I share with many others.<br /><br />The unsalted ""snack foods"" offered through Amazon can be delivered in case-quantity then set out at social events to introduce others to healthier eating."
5;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.
3;sweetner;The taste is sweet without any bitter after taste. However I had to use more than the recommended amount to get the sweetness I desired in beverages and recipes.
5;Canidae totally works for our Retriever/Border Collie mix!;Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down.
3;Decent;I like these in that they are not loaded with sugar, so I save them for my little boy, but the taste is not great. They do last a little longer than regular gumballs.
1;Must to avoid!;"Fair Trade, yes. My daughter says they should call it ""Fair Trick""."
4;Great Support;Arrived slightly thawed. My parents wouldn't accept it.
5;Great For Chocolate Lovers;If you love chocolate (like I do), then you'll probably enjoy this cereal.  The cereal squares are multi-grain and filled with real chocolate.
1;Nasty;The non-diet flavors all have Splenda.  In addition to sweeteners.
5;great coffee;This is a really strong wonderful coffee, not bitter in any way. It's the only one we drink now.
2;The pineapple flavor is a bit too much for me...;..
1;These are preserves, NOT jelly!;If you're like my mom and have an intestinal condition that is aggravated by hard rough food or SMALL HARD SEEDS, don't buy this. The product is tasty enough, but she can't eat it due to it being packed with zillions of hard, miniscule seeds!<br /><br />Did someone change the rules? Last I checked, Preserves = ground up fruit.
1;Meow.;I have a cat named Charlie who loves this food. I have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when I feed him Iams then with other foods.
5;Baby Food Freezer tray;We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.
5;Dogs love this stuff;My dogs love this product and this was the cheapest I could find it any where. Shipped and received as notified when purchased.
4;Another Great Coffee from Green Mountain;Green Mountain's Our Blend Fair Trade K-Cups are perfect for someone who is looking for a mild coffee flavor.  This coffee has a smooth taste that is rich but not overpowering.
5;opinion asked so I gave;the Altoids are a great item to have around for two reasons.  They curb nauasea when I was sick and they also are great for nausea any time i get it.
1;Not a peach ring, but rather a rubber jelly.;This ring didn't taste like a peach ring at all.<br />Rather, it was probably the worst jelly I have had in my entire life.
2;Expiration Date Close;I purchased this item(s) only to find that I had only 2 months to use it all. Won't buy again.
4;Like Cheese Jax not Cheetos;I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are.  They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos.
2;Payback for US franchises fattening Hindus in India;What I mean is that the ratio of calories to grams of protein is unacceptably high, and there is too much butter used in the making. Also, the seasoning is slightly higher than mild for US tastes, although if you like Texas chili, you might like it.
5;Outstanding quality and just sweet enough!;The dried cherries are wonderful.  I did crunch into a few that had part of the pit, but it did not deter me from continuing to eat them.
5;Puuuuuuurfect;This is the ONLY cat food my feline will eat every bite!  Until I found Fussie Cat, the only thing benefiting from the cat food of that time was the ferel cat down the street
5;Just awesome.;I've been a fan of hot sauces for 35 years, I've tried a lot of sauces and enjoyed many.  Matouk's West Indian Hot Sauce was one of the first I tried, and it's still one of my top 3 favorites.
5;Great for iced tea!;I make Stash Premium Decaf Raspberry & White sun tea to drink iced during the warmer months. I make a half gallon at a time and add a quarter cup of sugar and store it in the fridge to drink through the week.
5;Good and Strong;Taylors of Harrogate are known for their exceptional teas and very consistant quality control. I am used to their Yorkshire Gold and and a few of their other wonderful blends, and was happy to find one a little stronger.
5;Liquid Vitamin that tastes great!;"Ever since I saw Mio I thought it was a cute idea, but why do I really need flavor? I prefer function, and VitaminSqueeze Fruit Punch is my family's favorite, and get the flavor for free!<br />Great taste! My kids definitely prefer a small glass of ""Fruit Punch"" in the morning over a Gummy Vitamin. Anyway, great new product."
3;Made my baby spit up;I think this was starting to work but it made my daughter spit up all the time.  More MIlk Plus from Mother Love worked much better for me and for her.
1;Blegh;Tastes like cat food and has a similar consistency. The other mixer flavors are much better.
5;Literally the best thing I've had in ages ....;The price on Amazon is a lot higher than my local store (even excluding shipping). That said, if you live in a remote area where you can't get these, I'd still fork out the extra money.
5;Super addicting!!!;I usually don't like artificial coconut flavored stuff, but this roasted coconut chip is soooo good. I ate the 1 whole bag on my way to work, though I do not recommend doing that.
5;excellent candy;perfect candy
4;popcorn;I tasted this popcorn while getting my oil changed at the dealership.  It was just like movie popcorn!  They popped it in the type of machine used at theaters, only smaller.
5;Perfect Breakfast Coffee!;I happened upon Tierra at a TJMax and thought I'd give it a try.  Best decision I've made.
5;Taste great and good for you!;Ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. Cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock.
5;Great taste, great product!;I ordered this popcorn to use with the popcorn marker I got for Christmas. Very good popcorn, I wasn't sure about the coconut oil taste at first but it's a very mild coconut flavor that one can barely taste.
5;Sugar Buster;We use it at night to lower diabetes sugar and it works.  My husband has been able first to reduce the medications and now has been off for 2 months.
5;kicks hershey butt;Found this at a local store. It looks cheep, butI liked it better than both the Hershey  and Ghiridelli varieties I've tried (as well as a cocoa from the bulk section).
3;Great chips, but a little too salty for my liking;Considering these are baked, they are very tasty.  They are super crispy and taste like fried goodness, but without the oiliness.
1;Really bad metallic taste- didn't feel refreshes;Had high expectation, but was pretty disappointed.  This had a metallic after taste and I didn't physically feel as good as I do after something like gatorade.
1;BEWARE!!  Made my dog Sick!!!;"I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my 5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named ""Calla""."
5;the best of the best;"My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the ""Donut Shop"" cups and they are spectacular."
5;Chevy is happy!;We got our Kong and Ziggies the same day. Up til then he had only had homemade treats.
5;My favorite Stevia Product;This has been a favorite of mine.  I use in mostly in hot drinks.
3;too weak... not a medium dark roast...;It doesn't have weird and very bitter aftertaste some other coffees have, but basically it doesn't have much taste at all.<br />I'm a strong-coffee-lover, which is why I ordered medium-dark roast.
4;Really good stuff!;This turkey jerky is really good.  Just the right amount of flavor and chewiness.
5;Amazing!;Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I'm trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn't difficult to make the shift when I get older.
5;I'm so glad I took the chance!;There were a few previous reviews that had me concerned that these wouldn't be *quite* what I remembered..
4;Yummy Drink from Crystal Light;The Margarita Mocktail is pretty close on flavor, with a tangy lime taste that is noticeably more interesting than a typical lime drink. It might have been a little too tangy - diluting just a little bit more than the directions made for a smoother flavor.
4;Really good olive oil;I like this oil very much.<br /><br />It has a distinct flavor, strong enough to be enjoyed but not overwhelming.
5;Yum!;You just can't go wrong with Miracle Whip! The flavor has a nice tang to it, just ever so slightly sweet, and goes great with just about anything - the yolk mixture in deviled eggs, ham and cheese sandwiches, BLT sandwiches, even as dip (with the right recipe) I like this far better than real mayo, mayo just tastes like Miracle Whip gone bad. I like the new containers they came up with for their product, it's a lot less messy than a jar and a knife, especially at group occasions.
5;Great for Training!;This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.
5;Delicious!!;I just brewed my first batch and this is by far the best green tea I've tried.  My family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups!  Yummmmmmmm.
5;Worth the price;Using these in the everlasting treat ball, it takes my dog about 30 minutes to get them loose and consume them.  I have used the regular treats as well (without the interlocking bar) and she can pop those out in no time.
5;Now This Is Good Tea;My first box of Stash Decaf Green Tea arrived about 15 mins ago and I'm sitting here enjoying my very first cup.  This is a really good cup of decaf green tea!!!!  I used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea.
4;Good Treat in Moderation;Dingo Munchy Stick / B000FPM5DA<br /><br />When I first bought these, my puppy was 3 months old and 6 pounds heavy. I wanted something that he could chew on to keep him interested and out of trouble when I couldn't watch him for short periods of time, for instance, when I take a shower.
3;ok but....;It's good for a GF food but as all GF foods go, you really have to watch this for the second it is done as it gets very mushy fast.  We are a family of 5 with 3 of those are under the age of 6, and we have to use 2 bags for a meal.
5;Makes a truly great Microwave casserole;One 5 ounce box of the Betty Crocker Cheesy Scalloped Skin-On Potatoes makes a truly delicious potato casserole that will serve four. For me this has become a time machine to a long forgotten comfort food.
5;GREAT DISH!;I am so glad Kraft makes organic mac & cheese!<br />Tastes just like their regular mac & cheese.<br /><br />A welcoming aspect for those going or gone organic!<br />Especially since most healthy foods are lacking in taste.
4;Nice Sampler !;Sampler was EXACTLY as described. I enjoy flavored coffees so this was just the ticket! I received 35 fresh cups of differing product: Coffees - flavored & regular, light roast, medium and dark.
4;Pretty good;These are pretty good for what I wanted they taste like the stuff you get at WaWa but that was what I was aiming for. If I want a premium cappacino I have and espresso machine.
1;Terrible;This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.
5;The benefits are amazing;This product is amazing. I had no idea how many benefits one jar could have.
3;One ring to almost rule all dogs.;After hearing that beef bones are bad for dogs (splinters and such), I started searching for a safer alternative for my german shepard Wiz.<br />Previous good reviews convinced me this braided rawhide ring was suitable.
5;you've never seen figs like these!;I received these as a most wonderful gift! I've had my share of fancy chocolates, but I've never had anything like this before. The chocolate creme inside the fig is soft and flavorful.
5;Puppy loves em;These pill pockets work great for dog medicine. Definately works better than trying to hide pills in meat or cheese, somehow the dogs just gulp these down whole and don't really separate the pills out.
5;Really Yummy!;I've been low carbing for some time.  These chips are great.
5;Bob's Red Mill For Fiber and Omega 3!;I wrote this review in regards to another product..
5;Best Bumble Bar Flavor;"I purchased a sample pack of Bumble Bars after trying them from a local store, so I've tasted pretty much every flavor and I have to say that the ""Lushus Lemon"" is definitely my favorite! It isn't really sour, but more of a sweet lemon taste - its soo good. Plus its made of completely natural, gluten-free and organic ingredients, so you can feel good about eating them (no, I do not work for BumbleBar - this is a REAL customer review!!)."
5;Delicious coffee after a long day at work...;I had never tried this particular brand of coffee before and I must say, I was impressed.  To be honest, most times I don't go for the flavored coffees
5;Expensive, but my cat is thriving on it;I decided to switch my cat's food because she was having all kinds of problems:  excessive throwing up, urinary tract issues, and significant weight loss that the vet couldn't explain.  I switched her from Kirkland dry and Friskies Turkey Pate canned to Wellness dry and Wellness chicken formula, and it's been almost an overnight miracle.
5;excellent coffee;Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.
5;Fit Fruit & Vegetable Wash, Soaker/Refill Bottle, 32-Ounce Bottles;This is a terrific product.  I use it on all my fresh fruits and vegetables.
5;Atomic Fireballs.;I love them because I use them for indigestion and have had some luck with stopping a migraine. I couldn't find them in the stores anymore.
2;Bitter taste;I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.
1;My dog threw up seven times after eating this.;Wish I'd read the bad reviews before feeding this to my poor pup. She is a 4-year old, 25-lb.
1;Useless;We have a bad hornet season, especially near the pool. The little buggers like to drink the water.
2;Don't recommend it;Don't care for this product. It is thick and creamy and has no coffee flavor at all so you have to add espresso to get any flavor out of it.
3;Hot Chocolate is not flavored coffee;I bought this sample pack believing I would receive 25 different flavored coffees.  Instead I received 15 flavored coffees, 4 hot chocolates, and 6 cappucinos.
3;"Sent me ""OLD"" product";"I ordered a case of these pretzels to give away as snacks--I ordered it on Dec 17 and when it came, it had the ""Use By Dec 27, 2011"" date stamped on each bag. I'm not happy that they sent me ""old"" product that is nearing the end of its shelf life."
5;It's Skippy and at a good price.;This is the low fat peanut butter you know and love, but at a great price.  Our local store sells this same PB for $5 a jar.
5;Baby loves it;
5;Great item!;This tea tastes great with a little honey or even by itself.  I have found that it does help up production some when drank all day long.
3;Yeah, it's definitely chewy;But, knowing that, I just bought an eight pack of it anyway. Here's my advice: rip open a package, pour it out on your cutting board and cut it into bite size pieces with your kitchen shears.
4;delicious, convenient, and salty;The best jerky I've found for a low price. I'd rather have the organic/free range/etc jerky but am a poor grad student, so this stuff works for me.
4;Mostly fruity, little green tea flavor;I love these convenient little packets that you can add to water anywhere to create a tasty drink. This particular Lipton product is great if you want to get the benefits of green tea but you're not that fond of the flavor of green tea.
3;Your enoyment may depend on how much you like the pulp;There are a great many green tea products available to the consumer, to say the least. I think what distinguishes this from the others is that this one really has a lot of pulp in it.
5;Gets My Vote;My bottle arrived just in time for a sushi dinner and game night planned with friends.  I had three soy sauces to choose from.
5;Good--And I'm not a Coffee Fan!;"I was expecting this to taste like a store-bought frappaccino,sweet and creamy but with that ""factory produced"", in-genuine edge to it. I was surprised that it tastes more like something you'd pick up from a coffee house though! The actual coffee bean flavor stands out in a more robust manner than a typical canned coffee/capp/frapp drink."
3;Java, java, java, java, - JAVA !;Usually I am not a Starbucks fan.  I find their coffees to be bitter and generally too strong.
5;nut nut;Can't live without peanut butter and now I don't have to. Great peanutty taste without the over the top fat grams.
5;Wow!  Get the big tin!;I made a tiny amount of this matcha and added it to a cup of hot skim milk and stirred in a teaspoon of raw sugar.  Oh my goodness!  This is so rich and so decadent, so GOOD!  Don't buy the small tin, because you are going to want to drink this all the time this fall and winter!  This isn't just a drink with some pumpkin pie spice in it, this is a well thought blend of flavors to give you an extraordinary warming experience.
5;Absolutely Gluten Free Flatbread;Product is excellent.  I learned of Absolutely Gluten Free Flatbread through buying at Wegman's who stocks it only seasonally.
5;Perfect for when you NEED to eat something sweet!;These fruit crisps are ideal for those times when you just need to eat something sweet but you don't need the extra calories. They taste a little sweeter than your regular cereal bars and are crispy.
2;Not enough cinnamon taste;I'm a big cinnamon fan.  I am a Costco member and have purchased this product at the local store.
1;Poor choices of flavors;I ordered this hoping to have diff flavors of coffee for our office, needless to say I get 2 French Vanilla and 2 Hazelnut and the rest of them are decaf and bold blends.<br /><br />Really bold blends?  If I wanted bold I can buy that at the grocery store I wanted the flavored coffee's so from now on I will buy them on ebay where I do get the 24 different flavors of coffee.
5;Worth importing;This soda is absolutly amazing, one of the best drinks I have ever tasted. The Coca-cola company should really start to produce it here.
5;works great;These work great for giving my 20lb Lhasa glucosimine.  I had given up because I got tired of trying to find something to put them in, she would always find them and spit them out, even though the bottle said they were yummy and chewable.
5;Great Tea;This is a great tea. Very smooth.
5;Orange flavored Natural Calm Powder;I love the orange taste and use the product daily.  I no longer have the leg cramps that plagued me and plan on continuing to purchase orange flavored natural calm at Amazon.
1;Without a doubt, the WORST mac-n-cheese I have ever tasted.;"I bought the Annies Homegrown Microwaveable Mac-n-cheese.  Actually my wife bought it because it is so-called ""healthy""."
3;Not as good as Pillsbury Funfetti;The rainbow chip is okay. Everyone one in the family felt the Pillsbury Funfetti tasted better.
5;Excellent bread;I've been GF since 1997 and know firshand what a struggle it is to find good tasting bread. This cinnamon raisin bread is very good and works well in a bread machine.
5;Great for dogs with stomach problems;My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.
1;Yikes!;Was sorely disappointed in this product.  Although the product was vacuum packed, it did not taste fresh and the salmon smelled like canned tuna.
3;My pups will eat anything--but they won't eat these unless they're the big ones;I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners.
1;it's not strong enough;After I tried totonac pure vanilla extract, spending $$ on this paste was a waste. Its inferior to the other brand and really isnt strong enough.
1;The Worst Ever;Amazon is a mess.  This is not earn any kind of star, but you have to or you can't submit your review.
5;A Big Favorite;Our dogs love very flavor of these treats. I like that they last so long! Our dogs all take turns throughout the week working on the treat bit by bit.
4;Great Product But Inconsistent Sizes and Density;I love this product.  My dog absolutely loves them.
1;Why do their organic foods contain gelatin???;I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.
5;Dogs love them;I must have about 10 of these around the house.  The dogs simply love them from the 11lb pug to the 50lb mutt.
5;Awesome!;There is only one bad thing to say about these! They disappear fast! Oh my gosh, they taste so great, everyone loves them. I bought these as a gift for my daughter and son-in-law.
5;From a recovering Diet Mountain Dew addict;Last year, I was drinking probably two 24 packs of Diet Mountain Dew a week. I thought this was rather unhealthy (and expensive), so I decided to gradually taper off.
4;Good but....;They are a strong banana taste and it can be over powering since its like a fig newton without the center so its dry. They are good, but I love banana, but my 15yr old keeps grabbing around them in the pantry so I dont think they appeal to him.
4;Our favorite cereal;When Costco stopped carrying our favorite, we had to find another source that was reasonably priced.  This product fit the bill.
5;Great Bonsai Starter;Ordered for my daughter who loves Bonsai trees. Arrived in good condition and she had fun potting it.
3;not very crispy tasting;My husband and I regularly eat crispy brown rice cereal.  Usually the stuff we buy has some kind of preservatives in it.
4;Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight;****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid.
5;Great!;The tea is delicious and came very quickly, which was good, because I was completely out.  :)  Will order again when Keurig.
5;Must have for rich soups;I make bone broth nearly every week and NOW Food Beef Gelatin has become a staple in that process. The resulting broth is amazingly rich.
3;good flavor, but crumbly;I bought these to help my afternoon sweet cravings that had gotten out of control.  I love chocolate, so I was hopeful.
5;Good value compared to Godiva store at the mall;The box is kinda small, so I thought I got ripped off, so I went to Godiva store in mall and there realized that this box is a really good deal.  Same amt.
5;delish stomach-settler;I bought these for my mom, to help with the nausea she feels with migraines -- they actually DO help. Now I carry them around, too, for hypoglycemia incidents.
5;My Favorite Coffee;My favorite, I have it auto shipped through Amazon. The only problem I have is I drink way too much coffee now because I like it so much.
2;Problems with food delivery;We've been getting these bars from our local Costco, and really like them.  When I saw that Amazon was selling them at a much better price, I jumped at the opportunity.
5;Awesome dog food!;We had been feeding our large breed puppy another brand of premium dog food but for some reason, his stools were always loose.  Since switching to Fromm's he's been great.
5;My favorite Sees assortment;I never used to like nuts and chews before I tried Sees
5;Best Tasting Ginger;Ok I don't know a whole lot about ginger but I do know I have tried other brands that were soapy tasting, tough, stringy, not very flavorful.  Then I tried this brand because it was cheap.
1;not even with a gun to my head;What really is the most horrifying thing about these GOD AWFUL bars of nuclear waste isn't that someone would manufacture them it's that people wrote reviews stating that they liked them and they tasted good. These people should be identified, rounded up and institutionalized for an indefinite period of time.
5;Puppy Drugs!;My puppy goes bonkers for these treats! As soon as she sees or hears one of us pick up the bag she comes running as fast as her little feet will move her. She literally leaps into the air trying to get to the bag! In fact I'm on my way to the pet store in just a few minutes to pick her up another bag of them.
5;Always Pleased;I've used Redbarn beef rolls and chicken and liver rolls for many years..
5;Much prefer this to any other brand.;Especially Ashoka (gag choke cough)<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, these mango pickles are very hot, but thats exactly what you want<br />with this wondermous condiment. Hot, spicy, and very flavorful without that vinegary bite that you<br />get with other style Indian pickles.
5;Smaller ones taste differenet;I agree with the other posters that the smaller size slim Jims taste different (and better) than the longer ones.  The extra large fat ones are the worst, IMHO.
4;Mellow Tea;I bought this tea hoping it would help give me a little more alertness working the graveyard shift. It tastes wonderful, but I felt no extra energy during or after drinking.
5;I LOVE POPCHIPS!!!;What a great snack!  I love these crispy, crunchy, treats.  Packaged in a single serve bag, I buy these by the pack of 24 assorted flavors so I have them on hand whenever I feel the urge to snack.
3;good taste;I like these mainly due to them being individually wrapped. I carry them in my pocket and eat one during meetings, church, etc.
5;Yummy treat;My puppy loves this!  I got the chicken and the beef favors.  It comes as filets but can be very easily broken into small treat size.
5;Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!;Love these! Well, because..
4;My Senior Dog Won't Eat This, But My Puppy Loves It;Will puppies eat anything you put in front of them? Ours will--including shoes, cardboard boxes, electrical cords, and our clothing (not that we put these things in front of him
5;It can taste really good!! But you need the right recipe!!;This cola is really good! Yep, I gave it five stars!<br /><br />There's really only one thing to consider here, and that is cost. I'll get to that in a minute.
3;Could have been stronger;We're really enjoying our new coffee maker, trying different types of coffee. This one wasn't our favorite.
1;Food upset dog's stomach (Bad bag.);Boxer has been on Blue Buffalo for 6 months
5;Sweet Potato Dog Snacks;My dog Frances has been a sweet potato lover for a year. When I saw sweet potato dog snacks on Amazon, I had to get some for Frances.
5;Love the Texture;First time I used almond flour in cookie recipes.  Its a low carb, healthier alternative for my diabetic dad who loves cookies.
5;Cytomax (stevia);I have used Cytomax exclusively for the last 20 years. This year they have gone to Stevia brand sweetener and I love it.
5;Great stuff, highly recommended;I just love this supplement. It gives me tons and tons of energy, my stool is nice and soft (not too soft).
5;lurrie in france;I saw Lurrie in Calais after a 6 hour drive down from Manchester & a Channel crossing that was extremely rough - however it was well-worth it all as he gave a stellar performance.<br />Like a young Otis Rush, he was totoall in commannd of his guitar &, even when he went down paths that seemed impossible, he extricated himsself with aplomb & an impressive feel for the music that cannot be taught.
5;Very Delicious;Easily one of the best summer sausages i have ever tasted.  I personally like the beef version of old wisconsin summer sausage because i think it taste better than the others when broiled.
4;Love these, but cheaper on Alice.com, though;These are our on-the-go guarantee that my little girl gets her fruits and veggies. She loves them and now knows to look for them at Target as well ($.
5;One of my favs!;I really love this granola. The dried berries are plentiful and sweet and reconstitute very well in milk.
5;great taste;This is a very welcome product.  It is so difficult today to find any candies that are made without GMO's.
3;Shipping and packaging problem;The cookies came crumbled into many pieces in 3 of the boxes I opened.  Also the chocolate chips had melted onto the cellophane.
5;Best of the Tassimo's;We've tried many Tassimo flavors.  This is by far our favorite.
5;YUM YUM;Italian roast is very expensive on average $14.00 a pound.
5;Best Russian Caravan available;Choice Organic Russian Caravan is my morning tea of choice since a few years back. This is a very high quality tea, no doubt about it.
5;Beware, highly addictive!;"These cookies are addictive!<a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Right on;You can buy fancy jars at your local grocery store that will also be named Thai red curry paste. Mae Ploy is authentic and rich tasting.
1;junkie no deluxe model ginerbread house kit;this is no deluxe and the items wont even cover the house it is not like show in pic it is a waste of my time and money..
5;Yummmmy!!;I just have to say, I devoured this entire bag myself, and shared with no-one. It was just that good.
5;Delicious!;The flavor is rich, sweet and you do not need to add anything to it. It has sugar and cream already in it.
5;Excellent Syrup;I've been buying this syrup through mail order from the ABCStores (located in Hawaii) since my trip to the islands in 2004. It doesn't have a high sugar content like some other coconut syrups.
5;A real taste pleasure;"I am not a big supporter of ""flavored"" coffee, that is UNTIL  I tried Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Coffee.  The flavor is very natural tasting and subtle."
3;Neat packaging, marginal taste.;My first impression of the taste of these cookies was that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a definitive chocolate taste, but it wasn't that.
3;good tasting but nothing groundbreaking;This carbonated juice drink tastes pretty artificial, although they claim that it's made mostly of juice. This is really more like a Watermelon Strawberry soda.
5;Stash Acai tea bags;Had a problem getting these in stores. Bulk bought online for my daughter.
3;I didn't care for the flavor;The packet of dried onions and other seasonings did not add well to the flavor.  The seasoning is somewhat spicy so kids should watch how much of the seasoning packet they add.
5;Must have Black Tiger!;A lot of K-cups say they are strong. I've tried many - Emeril, REVV, GM French Roast, etc.
5;Earthy and comforting;Its a really delicious earthy, herbal tea. Every cup makes me feel warm and comfy.
4;General Mills Healthier Breakfast option than Kelloggs;8 boxes of different single-serve cereals to keep you from getting bored every morning. Portion control ensures those of you on a diet won't go for too many calories.
5;The Best !;This is the best cracker I have ever had, period.<br />The flavor is unbelievable.
5;wellness;My yorkie loves this food. We chose it because you know whats in it is healthy.
5;Organic Mommy;I cannot say enough about these Happytot pouches!! My toddler loves them! I have to remind my daughter (who is in elementary school) that these are for her brother and I have other snacks for her! I love that it contains the salba. Anyway that I can get the Omega 3's in my picky toddler's diet I am all for it.
5;Healthy Paleo/Raw/YUMMY Snack;I got into Larabars, because I am trying to eat more natural, less packaged food.  Yes Larabars come in a package, but they do not have any preservatives, chemicals, or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce.
5;Finally a good tea;I am primarily a coffee drinker but I like to switch off to tea during the day. This is the best decaf tea I have tasted.
5;Little doggie attention magnets!;I am a trainer at a local no-kill shelter.  I work with all different types and temperaments of dog, and the only common denominator is that I need their undivided attention and a reward they'll do almost anything for.
5;Best cup of coffee in a long time;I like Keurigs and Senseo coffee pots.  Unfortunately, I do not always like the available k-cups and pods.
5;MarkJump;This is the best and most amazing gum around.  It holds its flavor longer than any other gum that I've tried.
4;Pleasant Surprise;I've never eaten Steel Cut Oats before and was pleasantly surprised by how much I like them.  They take longer than regular oatmeal to cook, but this is not that big a deal.
4;It's okay;What's to say?  It's sweet without the bite of regular sugar.  It has dental benefits and is lower in calories.
5;The best k-cup so far;This is the best k-cup I have found so far.  I have tried them all.
2;Disappointing;My son used to love cheez-its before going gluten free. I bought these in hopes that they would replace the cheez-its, but my son did not like them.
5;Great tea;A great full flavored tea..
4;Good variety!;I'm not a vegan but I also love looking for meat alternatives for lesser calories and healthier options. The Cedar Lake Food variety is tasty for a completely meat-free food.
5;Latte snob;This coffee is great and works well with my Gaggia espresso machine. The pods are packed very well for good coffee flow.
5;Rich and soothing!;I have been impressed with this shampoo in terms of helping relieve my dry scalp and hair. Anyone with this problem knows full well how frustrating it can be--and if your like me you've most likely tried a lot of different shampoos which claim to help only to be disappointed.
2;So-So.;I can't say the flavor is bad because it isn't. It isn't bad for just a little bit of flavor.
5;Good price for the quantity :);It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.
4;Green Tea - Straight Ahead What You Expect;The following recommendation is based on having enjoyed over 100 tea varieties in the last 2+ years.<br /><br />When steeped as recommended.
5;A dieter's dream.;I discovered this while browsing through sugar free and low cal foods on amazon.  When I first tried it, I must admit I was a little turned off.
4;Dogs really like them;My dogs love these. They start drooling everytime they get these.
5;Wheaten's favorite;My 9 year old soft coated wheaten loves these snacks. Long lasting compared to others, I' ll buy more of these in the near future.
5;Amazing quality well worth it;Although I now have enough cinnamon for the next couple of year I am so glad I made this purchase. The quality is amazing and the price is phenomenal for two pounds of cinnamon sticks.
5;Enjoyable flavor!;I got a 5 k-cup sample box of this coffee from Keureg, and I find that it is my favorite decaf coffee. It brews a smooth tasting cup of coffee every time.
1;caution!;this item killed my  mothers cat ( she used the cat drops) this stuff is poison! So not use! Don't believe me? Ask ANY VET! she spend over a thousand dollars trying to save her cat after using this garbage. The vet stated this stuff should be illegal and its poison, they get people in all the time with bad reactions to whatever is in this stuff.
5;Dark and lovely;This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.
3;Jalapeno Pop Chips a No No;I love Pop chips- have tried many flavors and enjoyed them due to the low calorie count and they satisfy my craving for salt! With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip!<br />I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good.
4;Fun Little Toy;My Boston Terrier really loved this toy. With treats inside, it honestly kept him busy for about an hour as he tried to figure out how to get them.
4;French Vanilla K cups;I like this coffee with a few cookies or a little cake. It is sweet and makes a medium strength small cup perfectly in my opinion.
2;Peach Tea;"We found very little peach flavor in this ""peach tea"".  It is a poor substitute for Twinings."
3;Ok... but not so great...could be fresh, too...!;I just came back from Israel..
1;Tasteless- a big jar of disappointment;I love dried mushrooms.  All kinds of them.
2;Pleased One of Two Cats;Well, I sure don't like the smell (peeuwww), and neither does Missy. But poor old Faidra licks at it until the big pieces get the better of her.
5;Warm and soothing;"This tea is wonderful. It's strong enough to brew a ""big mug"" with your Keurig and still taste flavorful."
1;Don't be fooled by the picture;"I love the Diet Berry Energy Drink for all the reasons mentioned here. However, please note that the ""diet"" Berry Energy Drink is no longer available at all and anyone who orders the product pictured here won't get it."
3;Different brand shipped;I received Golden Bowl cookies. This is a different brand than specified in the ad.
3;Not terrible;I try to be healthier with my snack choices, and this isn't horrible. Could be worse, could be better.
1;Very Disappointed;Not what I was expecting. I bought this tree a week ago for a welcoming home gift for my wife.
5;Very Good.;A couple of the reviews I read here frankly are a bit weird.  It tastes exactly like pepperoni.
5;I use it daily;I love Nutiva hemp protein powder. I use it every morning in my green smoothies.
3;chips;These popchips were something I wanted to try because they were baked. The barbeque ones were okay but the rest of them were terrible.
5;Rainbow jimmies;I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.
5;This Hard Core Espresso Drinker Loves It;I really enjoy this illy issimo Coffee Drink. A lot.
3;Bland...bland....bland.;I wanted to really like this cereal.  We are big into old fashioned oatmeal for breakfast, as well as cooking with oats, in cookies and breads.
5;Great hot sauce;Just the right amount of flavor and hotness with lots of garlic. I use it an almost everything.
3;sold out;this used to be an awesomely organic solution to healthy petfood with no fillers..
4;Delicious with questions;I have been looking at this product for a couple months and finally gave in.  First of all, the name got my interest!  The taste is delicious BUT I'm having problems with the directions!  Haven't figured out if it's actually a hot beverage or do you put it in a hot beverage?!?!?!?!?  It has a scoop (small) and says to put that in a cup (instructions for 8 oz.
5;Tea for you and tea for me;The box it comes in is beautiful! Just the box is popular:)  The tea tastes delicious and it's a lot of fun to watch the flower unfold as the tea steeps in the pretty glass tea pot.  It all arrived quickly.
5;Cocoloves;I love coconut balls! Betty Lou made me so happy when they started making this flavour. Its really a delicious treat/snack.
5;Petit Cuisine Cat Food;Great packaging, and a great product. My cat definitely approved of the variety pack of fish flavored cat food.
5;I Loved the Cinnamon Snaps!!!!;I picked the Cinnamon Snaps up at my Grandma's local health food store the last time I visited and loved them.  I have yet to try the ginger snaps but I'm sure they are just as good.
5;Delicious;This is the first Chai k-cup that I have tried and SCORE..
1;Would not recommend to buy from here!!!;I just ordered the 5lbs bag date of receival is 8/28/09 and its expiration is 11/5/09. I did not order an expensive product just to get something thats almost expired.
5;they love them;My dogs absolutely love these!  They are a bit pricey but seem to be good quality.  Thanks dingo!!  I have small dogs.
5;Excellent tea at an amazing price!;I have not been able to find Taylor's amazing Earl Grey (loose leaf) at this price anywhere else. Free shipping is just cherry on top.
5;Van Houtee Creme Brulee coffee is a winner for a cold pick-me-up;I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup, then add a little artificial sweetener, a tablespoon of Hillsbrothers English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream.
5;Yummy;My husband loves this stuff. He says this is the best oat meal he has ever had.
4;imported from Lebanon;These brand is made in Lebanon, some say the Lebanese make the sweetest rose water. This product is Made from 100% distilled rose petals (ive seen some w/additives).
2;Weak;This brews a very weak tea.  I prefer Tazo or Bigelow brands.
5;They are crunchy and delicious;I have bought these cookies at a local market near me and they are excellent. They are crunchy and delicious and the vegan tastes as good as the regular.
5;Delicious and so much healthier for you;I have been wondering for years why there was no Stevia-flavored sodas on the market.  It had always been pick your poison between sodas loaded with insane amounts of sugar, or sodas flavored with Splenda/sucralose/aspartame.
5;Always a big hit!;It's great to have candy that (while probably not good to have as a daily diet) is not bad for the family.  Not to mention the lollipops actually taste great, and are cheerful colors.
5;PositiVibes;This popcorn tastes good and is the ideal size for a snack.  It is good for children too.
5;My puppy loved it;I ordered this Nutri-Boosters Treats for Puppies for my little doggy whom I've found on a street in Cape Verde, Africa. She was so small, she had so many skin problems, warms and anything you can imagine.
4;good coffee;The Green Mountain Nantucket blend is one of the best tasting Keurig packs I've tried. It's smooth with no bitter aftertaste, great cup of coffee.
5;Subtle Vanilla and Strong Coffee;This coffee has a very subtle natural vanilla flavor. The vanilla is probably less strong then most vanilla flavored coffee I've tasted.
5;WOLGANG PUCK FRENCH ROAST;WOLFGANG PUCK'S FRENCH ROAST HAS A DEEP ROBUST FLAVOR. I PREFER IT IN THE AFTERNOON.
5;Great Tea;This is the tea that helps clear gunk out of your lungs. I have lung disease and I usually drink a cup at bedtime.
5;Very tasty!;I use this as a treat for training and my dog just begs for more lessons!  I slice into small bites then add a little warm water and soak for 5 mins ..
5;Great Cereal for toddlers;Nestle Cerelac is a great tasting cereal for toddlers. My toddler would spit out Gerber, Best Earth and Beech Nuts cereals.
5;Totally worthwhile substitute for the normal Kraft blue box;I'm a mac'n'cheese fiend.  I love all kinds of mac'n'cheese from the powdered cheese-product variety to the real deal made with cream and endless cups of cheddar.
5;Aptly titled cookie company;These cookies are really great.  My kids love them.
5;Quality easy to grab packs;You would think not much could be said about pouches of nuts, however..
5;My favortite baked chip...;Bought the pack of 15 and made the mistake of having them delivered to my office.  They were consumed in a week.
5;i love these!!!!;i have been drinking these for a little over a year now..
2;Poor quality noodles, good broth;These have better than average broth, but less than average noodles. The decent powdered soup mix is not enough to make me want to buy such plain, tasteless noodles.
2;A good deal?;I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.
5;Thomas Jefferson knew best!;Peas were good old Thomas Jefferson's favorite veggie! Once you try Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps, you'll love them, too -- and be able to stash them in your purse or desk for a snack any time you want to indulge.<br /><br />Nutritionally, these are great, especially compared to the other junk you might find yourself reaching for.
3;A small bouquet.;The headline says it all. The flowers were in good condition, but the bouquet was rather small.
5;Love, Love, Love these...;Love, Love, Love these..
5;Best taste, best froth, organic, and reasonable cost;This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />1.
2;Totally misleading;Yes, the description says that some of flavors may be substituted without warning due to product availability. That being said, you are still led to believe that you'll be getting a wild assortment of 34 different flavors.
3;Good but..;I used to buy tins of this all the time.  I wish they still sold it like that.
5;Great price, great taste;You can't go wrong with this [[ASIN:B001E5E0D8 Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4).
5;Great growth, cute container;I admit to being sceptical about the seeds sprouting, but they did, within a day or two and once the kitten realised it was for her, she loved it.<br />The container is sturdy and very well made and planting the seeds was so easy.
5;Delicious - similar to Sesame Corn Thins;We're big fans of Sesame Corn Thins, but they haven't been available lately, so we tried these crackers.  The ingredients are similar, and it's a good cracker.
5;Smooooth;This is my treat after dinner along with some red wine.  I wish it wasn't so spendy but I guess that's the price you pay for quality chocolate.
4;Wolfgang Puck Coffee - Sumatra Kopi Raya for Keurig;"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon."
3;Low value;My intention was to buy in bulk and save money in lieu of purchasing at a local store. Not enough savings to justify processing the order and waiting several days for delivery.
1;Too Dry & Repackage;The package looked good, but the content was not so good. It's basically the repackage tea from the chinese supermarket.
3;Great if you like solid/dry meat snacks.;I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.
4;Just takes a few drops to cover the taste of non-filtered water.;We have a water filter at home and I usually take a bottle of filtered water to work - but when that's gone, there is only tap water, so I keep this at work.  It just takes a squirt per bottle and the strong mineral flavor to our water is tolerable.
5;I have 6 favorites, this is one of them;This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.
5;Happy Cat, Happy Owner;I adopted a young cat and was feeding Purina Cat Chow. My cat would eat and eat and EAT and then beg to eat more.
5;Zukes Dog treats;My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.<br /><br />I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
4;Came on Time;Were not as big as I had expected, but this was not a reflection of the shipper.  But they did come on time.
3;Great fruit mix, but contains 50% more sugar;This is a great mix of fruits with apples, pears and bananas. However, it contains 50% more sugar than other Gerber 2nd foods such as Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit and Gerber 2nd Foods Pear & Pineapple (10g of sugar instead of 15g per container)<br />I did not realize how sweet it is until I tasted the food.
4;Senseo subscription;Received fairly quickly.  I have been using pods for years so not a new concept.
4;Fresh Salad Greens;I started my salad pack approximately 3 weeks ago and have just started to harvest.  The kit includes 5 different kinds of greens.
5;A must for dieters;Read about Larabars in a diet book, and I went Larabars' website. I got several boxes including a variety box.
5;Golden loves them!;My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats.
5;Best Jasmine out there.;This Jasmine rice is good. So good they named it after that Aladdin character from the Disney film.
5;Great coffee!;We had this coffee in France and loved it.  So we were happy to find it available in the US.
5;One of my favorites;I love caramel and chocolate together.  This is very tasty.
5;Durkee, Famous Sauce Great family! Great sauce!;I went to an upscale  seafood restaurant last week where they took the sauce and put it in their own bottle labeled with the restaurant's name now as a Durkee myself and having grown up with the stuff  I knew. They admitted it.
2;Not sure how old these are, but at 19.18 a case they are 70 cents a can;I ordered these to see if it might save me the trouble of buying at the store.  My cats only eat the chicken savory shreds, so when I saw they had this, I ordered it without realizing how much per can I was actually paying.
5;Yummy and healthy;Both my son and I love these crackers.  They are yummy and fun to eat since they have the faces of Big Bird and Elmo!  And I can take heart that they are organic and perhaps healthier than other crackers out there.
5;Highly recommended by my pet sitting clients!;I recieved a bag  of these through my pet sitting rewards program. When I first opened the box I thought, hmm.
5;Multiples for real heat;These are exquisite. As others have mentioned, they are quite possibly the best picked sausage on the market.
5;Great tea for the price;This tea was what I was hoping for-something to cook with and add to smoothies.  I don't use it to make tea, so I don't know if it is suitable for the tea connoisseur.
5;Best Price Quinoa;This stuff is SO good for ya, and tastes really great.  Amazon has the Best Price I have seen so far, AND the shipping is free if you order $25.
5;Jade Sea Salt;Excellent merchant. Very good finishing salt.
5;Has solved our dog's alergy and GI tract problems 100%;"Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and ""prescription"" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it."
1;Inedible!;"In the spirit of New Year's Resolutions, I thought I would try this ""healthy"" snack.  Well, yeah, you will not put on weight with this product because it is inedible."
5;Great for Frappuccino but Powerful!;We use it to make Frappuccino. It works great! But Beware! Our recipe called for a teaspoon of the Xanthan gum.
5;Scrum dilly icious;"These are FREAKIN GOOD! The little hole in the tubes keeps you from eating them too fast. If you want them to be even more healthy, get the ""all natural"" version (from same company) that uses natural food coloring."
5;Very tasty cinnamon thins;These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc.
5;Addictive in the Middle;Every time I eat one, I get into it like Jaws dragging his teeth onto fruit wood. The ingredients may be self-explanatory.
4;Seasoning;I love this stuff..
5;Goof-proof PERFECTION, my family loves it!;"This is one of the BEST bread machine mixes I have ever used! For me, this is one that you dont get to be too ""creative"" with, just follow the directions, and you WILL get a perfect loaf. The only time I have had a bad result was when I thought it would be a super idea to semi-replicate a from scratch concept with bacon and MORE cheese."
5;A must have for any and every night out!;"I think it's a fair to say that on at least the last 3 new year's days I have spent the entire day hungover, telling myself ""I'm never drinking again."" This year, I attended a giant party where I drank more than my body weight in booze THEN finished off a fifth of Jameson with 3 others."
1;dont bothering!;Tea looked worse than lawn clippings. Was afraid.
5;If you drink red wine you've gotta get this aerator;When I told my husband I had ordered this aerator he told me I wasted my money- well he ate those words!  When the aerator arrived I had him do a blind taste test with a glass of wine poured from the bottle and another through the aerator and to my delight he said the glass from the aerator was more drinkable!  Ha!  This is a great product if you drink wine like I do- quickly.  I know that a glass bottle aerator is the proper method however if you are like me you don't have the time nor patience to go that route.
5;tonytada;very cheap compared to buying in the stores. great price for this product.
5;Glutino  gluten  free pretzels;These pretzels are a nice treat.  They are not to salty and really good.
2;Bloated and Gassy;I got these drink packages since I don't have time for breakfast in the morning and I'm always in a rush.  These drinks tastes very artifical which I expected.
4;cumin is not evenly dispersed;this is a very high-quality product, as far as sesame bars go. not too hard or sticky, and very fresh-tasting.
4;Great for people with kidney issues;I started getting this juice after I could no longer find the pure cranberry juice in my grocery story.  My husband and I have drank a couple dozen of these and receive them every 3 months.
5;"A ""Wellness"" Tea";Organic Echnicea Plus is a tea you can have at any time, caffeine free, and activates immune cells which helps you feel better overall.  It reduces symptoms of tiredness, illnesses and overall maintains a healthy immune response.
4;Sweet Strawberry;Matcha where have you been all my life! I mentioned in another review of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha tea that my discovery of tea is a very new adventure for me and that after reading rave reviews on Steepster about Red Leaf's eclectic selection of flavors, I gave it a try. I wonder now how I got along without it.
5;was even better than i expected;for the price i only expected one box, i ended up getting one case.  i still have left overs, for other gifts.
4;Best of the Instant Oatmeals;McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.
1;horrible taste & stinky;i ordered this tea to produce more breastmilk after reading on forums how good it is. thinking that it is a very good item I ordered 4 box at one shot! What a mistake! I thought I could drink anything but this is the worst thing ever i ever tasted! Like few others say, it also stinks up your place.
5;Love it!;This is one of the few snacks that I feel comfortable giving my kids and they love them. I started buying them as a snack for my office, and they can't get enough.
5;Great food;The grand edition food basket was delightfully received and very much enjoyed. Good choice for a gift anytime of year.
1;A shadow of its former self;The taste of this new formulation is a shadow of the original.  It lacks the zip, the taste and the zing.
4;in the recipient's on words (reaction to Broadway Basketeers Ultimate Celebration Gourmet Gift Tower);I just wanted to let you know that the snack pack was a wonderful idea for a present for us. With not only our son, his wife, and my mother here, but my son's childhood playmate, his wife and two kids coming over one afternoon, it gave us lots of ready made snacks.
5;Delicious! Amazing for a decaf coffee.;This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy.
3;A decent mint;When I first found Vermints, they were in smaller tins, in three flavors--Peppermint, Cinnamint and Wintermint.  This formula has sadly been discontinued and cannot be found in stores anymore.
4;London Cuppa;This is a great tea.,full of flavor and depth.
5;Baby loves her treats...;"I buy about 4-5 bags of these at a time, our Pug just loves them. They are always ""fresh""."
5;Delicious, tasty and versatile;I serve these as hotdogs for my vegetarian and Jewish friends who keep kosher. Once in a while meat eaters will try these and they like them, after I explain they aren't supposed to taste like meat and the texture might be a bit rubbery.
3;cakes-a-crumbly;i love the rice cakes and have been ordering them for over a year now but..
1;No direction oily goo;I have liked the other products by this company so I gave this a chance.My husband and daughters have dry scalp and I thought this might help.
5;Fantastic product;Great!  My dogs beg for them.  One won't even finish his dinner because he wants his Nutri Dent.
5;Extremely Happy with my  order!!  I'm in...VANILLA HEAVEN!!!!;"I don't understand(believe) the ONE negative review posted here. Why are they the only dissatisfied customer?<br /><br />My 1/2lb Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans came in 2 days, and the whole box had the wonderful aroma of vanilla even before opening it!<br />My dark, 8"" long, moist pliable beans were vacuum packed and tucked neatly in a sturdy zip bag."
5;Jake gives these 5 stars!;My best friend, an aging Shetland Sheepdog named Jake, absolutely loves these treats!  We used to get them from a local pet store, but recently moved -- can't find them anywhere nearby.  So of course, we turned to Amazon, where happily they are half the price (before shipping) we were used to paying.
3;Good service, Poor Quality;So I was pleased to see that the cereal arrived before it's intended ship date, however when I poured my first bowl this morning and went for my first bite, I was pretty upset. I let it soak in the milk for a few minutes and then went to grab a big clump for my first bite, when I went to bite into it, it was rock-solid.
5;Tastes Good To Me!;I like bold k-cups. I don't stick to one type, because I always re-order on Amazon and pricing is always changing on Amazon.
5;Nice, Durable Bones!;I have always liked Nylabones.  We have bigger dogs that chew through raw-hide bones in a matter of minutes.
4;Yum!;While it is true that items like these tend to be a little riskier in shipping, mine came in perfect condition, not a broken cookie to be found.  However, that's likely luck of the draw when you're talking about a cookie like this that's so easily breakable.
5;Among the best K-Cups I've tried;Very dark, near-espresso, but complex.  Some of the best K-Cups I've tried, although I'd need to do a blind test between these & Dark Magic.
1;Not a very good batch.;I have had Joyva Halvah before and it was a lot better than this batch. Slightly dry with very minimal halvah taste compared to what I have had in the past.
5;Wonderful Tea;I use red clover tea a lot and so do my friends, it helps cure insomnia and is also known as a cleanser of the body organs. I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and cheerful after I use it, which is between once a week and once a month.
5;Excellent whole grain;This is a superbly nutritious grain that is also easy to fix.  Because it has already been rinsed, one can use it without rinsing off the hulls.
2;Very delicious flavor, the cream puffs with spices;Bananas taste very delicious cream puffs, after the openings have a very strong taste of the banana flavor, the taste is very light. The shape of a box in his pocket contained plum puffs, filled with very full.
5;relaxing and soothing, a tea lover's must have!;i love, love, love this tea.  it has a spicy and warm aroma and flavor.
5;Try it as Breakfast Cereal;Promoted as a snack, I liked it best as a cold breakfast cereal. Tasty, and the cinnamon oat cluster flavor pretty much covered over the flax seed taste (not a big fan of the flax flavor though I know it is good for you).
5;Great product..Dogs love it;I researched many varieties of dog food that are considered are very good quality food. I never realized what I was feeding my dog was the most nasty stuff, as most Purina products are.
5;By Far My Son's Favorite Flavor!;This flavor is my son's favorite! But, it's also my favorite because it's super thick! This is the only flavor from Earth's Best that I've found does not require an additional mixture of rice cereal to keep it from running all over the place.  The smell is pleasant and it doesn't stain.
5;Exquisite;
5;Great healthy dog food;I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.
4;Enjoyable, like other Crystal Light flavors;I enjoy Crystal Light's non-moctail flavors, and was very curious.  The mojito is as good as you would expect from Crystal Light.
5;the best way to start the day;I've been making some dietary changes in 2012 to try to improve my health and eating oats for breakfast is one of the easiest changes I've made. These steel cut oats are the best tasting I've found
5;These are soooo good!!;These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands.
5;Sooo Good;I really love these bars.  I prefer them more than name brand candy bars and they are good for you!  They came quickly and I had no problems with signs of melting in transit as I had with other nutrition bars.
5;Tasty and Sulfur Free;These make a healthy snack, are tasty and moist and best of all not preserved with any harmful chemicals. One of my children really enjoys these for a snack.
5;These bars are the best on the market;I have been enjoying these for years.  I was delighted to find out I could get them at a discount and on a subscription basis from Amazon.
1;Yuck!;I (and my little guy) have loved almost all other happy baby products, but this was revolting.  On the up side, my dog loves it .
4;Good Flavor, Excessive Gravy;This straightforward side has rich, bold flavor, with firm cubed paneer (pressed cottage cheese) in thick gravy.  The taste grabs and holds your attention so that, though it's a side dish, it doesn't cower meekly by the entr&eacute
3;Nourishing, Not Volumizing;My hair feels pretty silky and seems to be less frizzy than normal. It has less volume than with my normal conditioner, though.
5;My Cat's Favorite Treats;My cat goes nuts for these, unlike any other treats.  Oh, she'll gladly eat the other treats, but she purrs from the moment she smells these and then she sniffs around for ten minutes after she's eaten the last one, hoping to find more.
5;Heavenly;Without a doubt, these are the BEST Lemon Madeleines I have ever tasted.  The flavor is wonderfully true and the texture is so light and consistent.
5;"Best ""healthy"" salt and vinegar chip out there";I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip..
1;Ew ew ew ew;Ok you've got to understand I'm into gum. I love Stride gum, some Trident flavors, a couple other sugarless flavors.
1;Sounds like a novel idea, but it failed miserably.;The only reason this product got a 1 star is I can't give it a 0! The picture and product info lead me to believe I will be getting a plant, I received a seed, one seed and it did not grow. I do read the reviews, and then tend to temper my decisions based on whether or not I am willing to take the risk.
5;The Best!;This is the best balsamic glaze we've ever had.  Compares to the very expensive brands you find in high priced specialty stores.
1;Grossest of all Glop;This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging.
4;The fish is better;The quality of the Petite Cuisine cat food is not the problem.  There is no question that the food is high quality.
4;Great Product;The product is awsome. I have not seen any ants since i first used this product.
5;Best Buy for Strong Coffee;This coffee along with Timothy's Parisian Nights are the two I found that actually contain 25% more coffee than other K-Cups.  We like strong coffee and this one is the best price purchasing it through Subscribe and Save.
5;Best Popcorn Ever;This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb.
5;Delicious artichoke hearts!;These are very tasty artichoke hearts.  The outer leaves of a few of them may need to be discarded but the rest of it is fresh tasting and delicious!  The brine is not at all salty which allows the true flavor of the artichokes to come forth.
1;very poor quality cat food;I am a big fan of Paul Newman dog food, but the cat food product was a big disappointment.  Upon opening the box, the smell of rotted fish was overwelming and several of the cans were leaking.
5;Pretty, Old Fashioned Candy;Bye with confidence.  This is beautiful old time candy.
4;Quick and easy and pretty good for a boxed mix;I first bought this product about 6 years ago when I just started to get interested in Thai cooking.  I thought that it would be easier than making it from scratch (which is what I prefer to do now) and it is.
5;Perfect treat for Choco-holics!;If you're like me who is trying to watch her weight and craves chocolate 24/7 then you must try these brownies! All you need is 1 small container of vanilla yogurt. I buy organic yogurt to mix in.
4;Taste like water...;Taste like water. Nothing special in taste.
5;Delicious!;I really love Indian food but sometimes I just feel like staying at home to eat it.  I have tried several other companies who make Indian packaged food but nothing takes like Sanskriti.
5;Fantastic, best dried soup ever;This is by far the best dried soup I've ever had, and definitely better than both mom's and my homemade split pea. My girlfriend can't get enough of it either, and its perfect for vegans like me.
3;It's tasty but the ingredients are poor;I like the taste of these, though too spicy for me if I use the entire flavor packet. However, the poor quality ingredients are a downer.
5;a glass of cold ice tea is happines;have not been able to find this tea in years.  i like to make my own from lose tea.
5;Delicious!;I tried to eat/drink this soup the way they instructed on the back of the package, but I found it to be too small of a serving.  Here's what I do, and it's amazing:  I bring 1 cup of water to a soft boil, and throw in the soup mix, allow that to build up to a soft boil and then throw in 1 egg, whole.
5;KC;My cat KC loves this product. When we ran out and counldn't find any in our local store's.
5;My daughter's favorite snack!;My 18 month old LOVES Happybaby pouches. The straw is so easy to use at home and on the go.
5;Very Good!;The tea taste is very good, I've taken it yesterday for the first time. I'm taking it because of my pregnancy, many friends told me about its precious toning for the uterus.
5;Ranch Style Beans - Like No Other;I have search high and low for a bean that compares to the Ranch Style brand, unfortunately there isn't one. Chili beans leave a lot to be desired with their over reliance on chili powder rather than true flavor that Ranch Style has to offer.
3;Very Very oily;"As a name brand hair-prep from the 50's once said in its advertising - ""A Little Dab'll Do Ya!"" and this is So true with CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm. I have short hair, so I used only about 3/4 teaspoon of this on my hair -- it spread like oil and covered every strand of hair in seconds."
4;Pretty Good :);These are pretty good. The package says<br />do not put in microwave, but they are totally<br />safe to put in the microwave.
5;GREEN MOUNTAIN DARK MAGIC from AMAZON.COM;I have enjoyed Green Mountain's Dark Magic (Extra Bold) for some time now
3;OK, but kind of false advertising;"I got these on a whim, mostly because they seemed like a really awesome specialty item, which my local pet store doesn't sell many of, since the owner (Chester Uphill) doesn't like buying stuff from ""invading foreigners."" I remember one time when I dressed as a Mexican mariachi for Halloween and he came at me with a gardening hoe."
5;Freeze Dried Liver for Dogs;Duffy (The dog) begs for them.  He sits up begging in the corner by the canister for these treats.
3;A matter of taste;I love Yogi teas in general. I happened to have just ordered twelve varieties of it, including this one, when I was offered a free box to try out.
5;Taste Great, but Sold in a 12-pk Not a 6-pk;I'm not sure why this is listed as 6-pk.  It's sold as 12-pk.
4;Good Stuff!;Great jerky.  Not too tough.
5;YUMMY is an understatement;Don't buy this coffee if you want regular coffee.  It is NOT, I repeat NOT just coffee that sort of has a hint of flavor, or smells better than it tastes.
1;Disgusting!;Don't bother..
5;My dogs LOVE Sojos;"I rescued two Korean jindos over the past 12 months, and the female had really bad food allergies. Since the breed evolved on an island off South Korea - subsisting on rice, veggies, meat scraps and fish - I definitely wanted to take them off kibble and onto something more ""native."
5;Matcha Green Tea;I have used this product for several years as a base for my morning smoothie. I add a variety of other items to it: ground flax seeds, chia seeds, sunflower seeds, cinnamon,Green Vibrance, blueberries, banana, coconut oil, Stevia and ice.
5;Love these cookies!;I can hardly put these down once I open a package.  Bought these originallyt at a discount place (only pkg.
4;This product is of desired quality;The peppercorns arrived just a few days after ordering. The husk is all there is, just like it should be.
5;Great for toddler with cow and soy milk intolerance.;My baby has had digestive issues from birth. At 12 months I put her on this product and immediately saw improvement.
5;5 POUND bag?! They didn't lie.;I have to say this stuff is rather..
5;Highly recommend;This is a great salt from a very customer oriented company, you can't go wrong ordering this product..
5;"Fantastic decaf - but it's a light roast, not ""extra bold""";This is by far the best decaf I've ever tasted.  It's better than most regular coffee.
5;Sugar Free Haribo Candy;When ordering these Haribo Gummy Bears I was both excited and worried.  Excited at the possibilty that my favorite gummy bear maker had a sugar free version and worried that it would taste horrible!  My whole family loves them and can NOT tell the difference.
5;Great Tasting Tea;I like the light Peppermint flavor. I usually use it with a regular Black Tea bag and<br />it really taste Good.
5;Best ground coffee;I have a one cup coffee brewer that uses pods and ground coffee and this is by far the best ground coffee I've tried.  I agree with the consumer magazine that rated this as the best 100% Colombian coffee they had found to test.
5;Excellent popcorn bags!;These popcorn bags are perfect.  You get a big box of classic, movie-style popcorn bags.
5;Hot Chocolate is GRRRREAT!!!;My husband suggested we buy the Cinnamon Hot Chocolate.  It is wonderful we both love it.
4;So far, so good...;I have 2 cats, and one of them has a lower bowel disorder, for which he is on daily medication.  I've been trying out different types of foods to aid him with his condition and, so far, this seems to be doing the trick (though I am using this along with Orijen).
5;Lovely;I'm a big fan of this sipping chocolate. It doesn't have chemical-type ingredients or nasty oils, so that's a big plus.
5;my dog loves it;my dog truely loves it.  I gave him one small size before his bed time, and he is always happy/can't wait to have this treat.
4;"""Must Have""";Delicious flavor enhancer. I will never go back to kosher salt again.
5;Great product;My dog absolutely loves these treats. We hike every weekend and run every night and he gets these after as a treat and to help with aches.
5;O My Goodness;I have never been a tea drinker, at least without a ton of sugar in it.  I just had a spa day with dear friends and they served this tea.
5;BFF Tuna and Bonito Be Mine, 5.5 oz. 8-pack;I recently upgraded to higher quality canned food, first trying the standard Weruva offerings and now the BFF (a Weruva sub-brand?) I like that BFF offers flavors with gravies and others with aspic, as it increases feeding time variety. BFF is certainly a good value compared to the other high-end natural and grain-free products, and even my pickiest senior guy enjoyed the tuna and bonito variety.
4;not too hot;"The <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5;Great cookies, makes a nice pie crust too!;I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.
5;do people pay this much?;this is tasty, very yummy and obviously i love this drink..
